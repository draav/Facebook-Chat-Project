Steph Dudak May 14, 2011 at 2:11pm EDT
Lovely

Nick Devlin May 14, 2011 at 3:36pm EDT
Yeah I played another game and lost.

Nick Devlin May 14, 2011 at 3:36pm EDT
The kid was in 3rd grade by the way

Nick Devlin May 14, 2011 at 3:39pm EDT
The last one was in 4th so its not that bad

Steph Dudak May 14, 2011 at 3:40pm EDT
L m a o. You poor thing

Nick Devlin May 14, 2011 at 3:50pm EDT
Glad the laughter came before the pity

Steph Dudak May 14, 2011 at 3:52pm EDT
I'm sorry you lose chess games to 8&9 year olds. You should practice more

Nick Devlin May 14, 2011 at 4:02pm EDT
More like 6&7 year olds, They probably all skipped a couple grades. I feel like I'll accidentally step on one.

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 7:13pm EDT
Have fun with SATs?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 7:30pm EDT
NO

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 7:30pm EDT
not at all

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:03pm EDT
was that sarcasm?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:05pm EDT
no it was serious

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:05pm EDT
sats are awful lol

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:05pm EDT
i probably did worse this time than last time

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:49pm EDT
i should really try responding more often than every hourt

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:49pm EDT
and how? you already know what its like shouldnt it be easier?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:49pm EDT
it's fine. i don't need human interaction. lmao

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:49pm EDT
oh look i responded within a minute!

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:50pm EDT
i deserve a medal

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:50pm EDT
yeah you do

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:51pm EDT
anything besides SATs today?

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:51pm EDT
that wasn't as suckish

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:51pm EDT
yeah. i walked into my bathroom, my phone fell outta my sweatshirt pocket and fell into the toilet. and it's now sitting in a bag of rice

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:51pm EDT
in hopes that it'll work tomorrow

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:51pm EDT
but probably not

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:51pm EDT
with my luck

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:51pm EDT
since it fell in the first place

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:51pm EDT
...awesome

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:51pm EDT
no.

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
no?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
it's not awesome

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
i suppose if you say so

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
-.-

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
this happened at like 2

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
8D

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
right after getting home from sats

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
i was so angry

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
but you forgot how much SATs suck right?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
not at all

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
oh well

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
it was like

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
got home from g's. my thought process was this:

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:55pm EDT
"Man SATs suck. Now I gotta get started on those three packets. Womp." *walks into bathroom and phone falls* "FUCKING JEW ARE YOU KIDDING ME." *speaks aloud* "THIS IS NOT FUCKING HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. MY FUCKING PHONE ARE YOU KIDDING." meanwhile no ones home *thinks again* "My phones probably broken. I probably did worse on these SATs than the last, and I still have to do those mother fucking packets."

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:55pm EDT
wow your memory is awesome

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:55pm EDT
but the memories themseles suck

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
yeah well that was generally what happened

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
and yes indeed

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
well i am babysitting now

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
babysitting who

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
a dog

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:57pm EDT
uuh

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:57pm EDT
that's dogsitting then

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:57pm EDT
same thing

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:57pm EDT
he insane by the way

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:57pm EDT
sounds terrible

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:57pm EDT
wanna know whats worse?

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
i was home alone all day

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
and instead of doing stuff

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
i cleaned the house

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
for no reason

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
...

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
at least everything's clean now

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
i've been wasting time

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
and procrastinating those packets

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
i did work on them a little bit. but 100 math problems for a final review when i'm exempt is not really my cup of tea

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:59pm EDT
nor is that chem packet

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:59pm EDT
nor is the other algebra packet review that's for my test next week

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:59pm EDT
4 full days of school left. what is this, nicholas?

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:59pm EDT
no clue

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:59pm EDT
i just found another packet due on monday

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:59pm EDT

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:59pm EDT
o.o

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 8:59pm EDT

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 8:59pm EDT
so you can count

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:00pm EDT
looks like you don't need to worry about the math ones.

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:00pm EDT
XD

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:00pm EDT
these questions are about that simple

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:00pm EDT
but there are 100!!!

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:00pm EDT
what's the other packet for?

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:00pm EDT
comp programming

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:01pm EDT
ooooo

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:01pm EDT

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:01pm EDT
send me one :D

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:01pm EDT
all right

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
4. The unique binary representation of the location of data in memory is:

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
a

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
ASCII

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
b. an adress

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
D

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:03pm EDT
Neither do I!!

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:03pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:03pm EDT
it gets harder

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:03pm EDT
but you're in the class! shouldn't you know these? XD

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:03pm EDT
wait i forgot you don't do any of the ACTUAL work

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:04pm EDT
I know! I just make programs that work and ignore whatever she's talking about

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:04pm EDT
Then she's all like, how'd you do that?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:04pm EDT
hahaha

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:05pm EDT
oh well

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:05pm EDT

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:05pm EDT
yaaay

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:05pm EDT
yay!

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:05pm EDT
i don't even know what my final project is in computer graphics

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:05pm EDT
i kinda am not lookin forward to it

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:06pm EDT
considering i have 4 days to do it. and it's prob gonna use

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:06pm EDT
you gotta finish it in 4 days?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:06pm EDT
cadkey, prodesktop, and datacad

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:06pm EDT
yes.

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:06pm EDT
we start it monday

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:06pm EDT

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:06pm EDT
 i wasn't able to print anything to the b size printer

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:06pm EDT
joe was -.-

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:06pm EDT
haha

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:07pm EDT
so i had to print my cabana on the a printer so he could grade it

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:07pm EDT
i tried like 7 times not even kidding

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:07pm EDT
everytime was just. nope. do not enter. you cannnot print.

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:07pm EDT
etc etc

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:07pm EDT
yep, school server was down on thursday

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:08pm EDT
further attempt was futile. it was awful.

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:08pm EDT
school computers suck

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:08pm EDT
basically

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:08pm EDT
all ours dont work since they ran out of memory

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:08pm EDT
we have to delete all of our projects now

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:08pm EDT
D:

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:09pm EDT
I know, that program that finds out if a number is odd or even was my favorite!

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:09pm EDT
i bet it was

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:10pm EDT
basically next year i will have no hair

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:10pm EDT
it will all be pulled out

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:10pm EDT
since i have like 5 computer classes

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:11pm EDT
FIVE

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:11pm EDT
WHAT

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:12pm EDT
i think so.. Java, webpage design, graphics, TV21, maybe another dont really remember

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:12pm EDT
wow

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:12pm EDT
well webpage designs only half year, yeah?

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:12pm EDT
yep

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:12pm EDT
that'll be fun

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:13pm EDT
more coding

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:13pm EDT
woo

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:13pm EDT
probably

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:13pm EDT
it is

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:13pm EDT
really?!

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:13pm EDT
layouts need coding nicholas

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:13pm EDT
noooooo

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:13pm EDT
it's easy though

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:13pm EDT
sure?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:14pm EDT
i don't see why you wouldn't do it. but it's easy

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:14pm EDT
good

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:14pm EDT
what do you have all english and art right?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:15pm EDT
XD. 2 art classes hopefully

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:15pm EDT
and then architecture

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:15pm EDT
so i guess you can consider that 3 art classes technically

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:16pm EDT
yeah. that'll be fun. full schedule.

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:16pm EDT
if i do get into ap art, i will get none of my art projects done lmfao i can see itnow

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:16pm EDT
i'll be staying after school til 4 everyday trynna get shit done

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:16pm EDT
what is prerequisite for AP?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:17pm EDT
2 years of art

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:17pm EDT
and you need a portfolio

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:17pm EDT
disappeared!

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:32pm EDT
whatt?

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:33pm EDT
you just disappeared, then respoded, and you've gone again!

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:34pm EDT
internet

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:34pm EDT
and technology

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:34pm EDT
is not working in my favor today

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:34pm EDT
i don't know why

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:34pm EDT
but it is not

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:34pm EDT
it seems that way

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT
i think it's good now lol

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT
safari decided it wasn't gonna let me do anything

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT
firefox decided the same.

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT
opera was nice enough to let me get on facebook.

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT
and now everythings working again

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT
how many browser's you have?!

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT
just those three lol

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
cool your jets

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
no need to yell

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
i just use chrome

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
why so many?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
i only use safari

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
those are just if i need to use a different browser for whatever reason

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
well my mom had me dl firefox because

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
she's got some toolbar on there for one of her dumb fb games so

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
opera's just cause i always have opera downloaded idk. as a backup lol. i don't like firefox. but i prefer safari over all. hence why i only use that. and opera in emergency situations

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
yaknow

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
it all makes sense now

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
although i have a feeling that that was a sign that i should get off my ass and do some homework because tomorrow is sunday

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
buut what are the odds that that will happen?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
slim to none, about a 27.5% chance

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
better than the odds of me doing that

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
probably lol

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
i should bring it down here. multitask

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
good idea

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
thats what i've been doing

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
google is nice with these comp questions

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:40pm EDT
haha win

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:40pm EDT
so i'm one step closer.

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:40pm EDT
my books are beside me

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:41pm EDT
the next task is to actually open em up

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:41pm EDT
you can do it!

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:41pm EDT
i realized that i forget like. everything relating to math. omg i was doing the final review and had to use my book for so much of it.

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:41pm EDT
cool right?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:42pm EDT
i feel like i learned none of it

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:42pm EDT
totally

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:42pm EDT
except it's not

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:42pm EDT
okay so what first. algebra or chem?

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:42pm EDT
algebra

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:42pm EDT
well the final review is due wednesday

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:42pm EDT
so then i have a trig packet & my chem packet

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
this test isn't gonna be fun

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
chem?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT
im doin the trig stuff

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT
REMEMBER

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT
SohCahToa

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:45pm EDT
i never knew it

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:45pm EDT
well like

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:45pm EDT
the weird stuff

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:46pm EDT
Use the given point on the terminal side of an angle ø (thats what it looks like but thats not it) in standard position to evaluate the six trigonometric functions of ø. 1. (8, -15)

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:46pm EDT
draw the graph

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:46pm EDT
plot the point

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:47pm EDT
make a vertical line to x-axis

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:47pm EDT
ø is the angle connecting to origin

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:47pm EDT
ooooooooooooooooo

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:47pm EDT
that thing

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:47pm EDT
we went over that for like 5 minutes in class

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:47pm EDT
might explain why idk it

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:47pm EDT
i'm not sure how i know it actually

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:48pm EDT
so like

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:48pm EDT
hold on

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:48pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:48pm EDT
yeah it is

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:48pm EDT
i should do it more often

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:48pm EDT
...

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:48pm EDT
not really

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
http://i51.tinypic.com/k2oemp.png is that what it's supposed to look like. idek.

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
wait

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
it's not

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
bc that's blank

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
that was awesome

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
hold on

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:53pm EDT
good job!

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:56pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:57pm EDT
haha

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:57pm EDT
nice

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT
find the length of the hypotenuse by using pythagorean theorum

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
oh really?

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
then use the 3 side lengths to find each angle with socahtoa

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
so that's what the question is asking?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
i just confused myself so bad

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
ok so

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:01pm EDT
wait

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:01pm EDT
where is ø on that lovely little picture?

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:01pm EDT
wait a sec

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:02pm EDT
oook

http://i551.photobucket.com/albums/ii472/dravarian26/homework.png

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:03pm EDT
why did you label those a o & h?

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:03pm EDT
those are the sides, opposite theta, adjecent, and the hypotenuse

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:03pm EDT
o

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:03pm EDT
duh

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:03pm EDT
in order to find sin, and cos, and tan

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT
OMG. DUH. OKAY.

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT
i got it =

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT
ignore that equal sign

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT
i will

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:05pm EDT
i forgot that sinø, etc even like existed and like. whatever doesn't matter

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:05pm EDT
thank you lol

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:05pm EDT
no problem

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:07pm EDT
i dont think im allowed to have decimal answers

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:08pm EDT
just leave it as radical then

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:08pm EDT
well

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:08pm EDT
i didn't have a radical to begin wit

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:08pm EDT
h

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:08pm EDT
so.

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:08pm EDT
oh

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:08pm EDT
then leave as fractions

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:09pm EDT
8, 15, 17 is special right i forgot

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:09pm EDT
is it really

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:09pm EDT
just like 3, 4, 5

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:09pm EDT
i'm totally failing this test

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:09pm EDT
maybe

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:09pm EDT
maybe not

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:09pm EDT
and i actually need all this weird math in life

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:09pm EDT
womp

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:10pm EDT
epecially if you're doing architecture

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:10pm EDT
exactly lol

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:10pm EDT
pssh, who needs safety regulations anyway

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:10pm EDT
just make it look pretty

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:10pm EDT
its ok i have a paper

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:10pm EDT
i'm not sure what this is doing for me

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:10pm EDT
?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:13pm EDT
i had this sheet

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:13pm EDT
with triangle stuff on it

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:13pm EDT
but i dont have it

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:14pm EDT
now i have this other paper

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:14pm EDT
which is useless

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:14pm EDT
trig ratios and reference angles

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:14pm EDT
which is what you wer just doing in that last problem

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:15pm EDT
how am i supposed to get a radical answer for this

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:17pm EDT
you aren't i just assumed it would conatin a radical

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:17pm EDT
contain*

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:17pm EDT
since using pythagorean theorum usually does that

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:18pm EDT
i cant have a decimal answer though

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
grrr, so hard to explain in chat

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
i need an explanation lol

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
okaythis is still the 8, -15 one right?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:20pm EDT
yeah

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:22pm EDT
so the sin would be 8/17 , since the hypotenuse is 17 and the opposite angle form theta is 8

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:22pm EDT
yes

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:22pm EDT
no i meant 15!!

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:22pm EDT
sorry

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:22pm EDT
i knw what all that is

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
i know the sin, cos, and tan

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
of all that

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
okay

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
then what?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
but once i have the fractions..

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
then what?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
exactly.

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
thats it

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
how

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
and just simplify the fractions then?

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
prettty much

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
oh

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
tyou can use those numbers to do more stuff

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
-.-

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
but question didn't ask for it

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:24pm EDT
i only need the 6 trigonometric functions lol

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:24pm EDT
you got all the reciprocals right?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:24pm EDT
yeep

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:24pm EDT
then your done

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:24pm EDT
sin goes with cosecant? cosine = sec, tan = cotan

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:24pm EDT
yep

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
stop overcomplicating

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
you finished problem

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
i know haha

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
question 2

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
my parents just came in here and looked through like all my math garbage

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
and were like

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
what the heck, you know all this?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
why?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
what does that even mean?

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
haha

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
you need to have this whole packet done by wednesday? *no not that one that one is due monday*

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
12 pages due monday what

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
omg

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
akgjldshjh

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
mine said that stuff starting around 6th grade

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
yeah

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
v53

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
i dont like sides like that

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
i'm not having fun anymore

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
at least you have memories of fun

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
this is what i've been doing

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
hahaha

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
http://i551.photobucket.com/albums/ii472/dravarian26/nothomework.png

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
hahahaha

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
i like how you named that not homework btw lol

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
what else would it be called

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
i almost called it homework2

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
turn that in to marotto

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
instead of whatever hw you should have done for her

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
lemme know how it goes

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
i do that occasionally

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
i turned in a test and for all the answers i didn't know i just put random facts and pictures

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
oh wow lol

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
she put question marks all over the place

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
she's no fun

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
i should be a teacher

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
nope

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
yes you should

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
just so i can put weird answers for multiple choice questions

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
and when people doodle i can doodle back

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
yeah that'd be awesome

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
there are some that do that

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
but i wouldn't be a teacher so lol

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
i should be a teacher

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
really quick, then you can get back to that

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
if my sin = -2v53/53

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
does that mean my csc = 53/-2v53, and i need to re-rationalize that?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
yeah right?

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
yes

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
womp

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
okay you can go on with your i should be a teacher story

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
it would be 53v53/-2

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
mutiply -2 by 53 dont you?

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
I would just ramble on about irrelevant topics, then lose everyone's tests mainly

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
because then when you rationalize, that v53 turns into 53

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
don't think so

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
if you have

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
-2v53 on the bottom

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
you have to

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
oh yeah that

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
and you cant just leave it next to the 2

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
sorry

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
that makes me think of mr fowlin

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
he'd talk about english while we were in history

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
yes then it would be 53v53/ 106

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
and math while we were in english

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
correct

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
fowling was awesome

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
negative though

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
YOU MUST HAVE A PERRRIOD

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
we were doing math problems

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
and he taught grammar

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
exactly haha

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:36pm EDT
like what are you doing

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:36pm EDT
he was an interesting person though lol

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:36pm EDT
his eyes creeped meout

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:36pm EDT
does he still sub there?

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
i'll ask my sister tomorrow

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
i just tried asking my brother

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
he decided to log off fb though soo

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
no hes at my grams

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT
i'm not lol

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT
i bet it is

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT
you should http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuplUYo33xE&feature=autoplay&list=PL455CB4CADEEE4951&index=10&playnext=3

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT
best album ever

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
so its basically jigglypuff singing

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
oh

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
just kidding

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
nope

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
i didnt hear the words

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
til just now

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
yeah i dont like it lol

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
you have no taste in fine art

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
lolok

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
it almost made me cry

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
so beautiful

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
DX

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:44pm EDT
i'm guessing that is an emoticon saying that you were incorrect and think that the song is amazing?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:44pm EDT
you are incorrect

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:45pm EDT
aw well

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
wow, i looked at chem packet

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
i can't even guess at these things

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
you need a periodic table for most of it too

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
yeah i lost mine

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
all 5 of the

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
them*

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
good going

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
OH NO

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
use your book

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
OH NO

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
i have a spanish project on monday

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
o

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
better do that

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
i am right now

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
i have to make model of a city from the future

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
i am making it on minecraft

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
commo estas? muy bien! y tu?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
idk if that's correct spelling

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
that sounds like oodles of fun

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
spelling is close, and it would be fun

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
if i had more than a day to do it

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
you really like having conversations with yourself in other languages by the way

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:50pm EDT
me?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:50pm EDT
what?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:50pm EDT
whatchu talkin bout

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT
how are are? i'm fine, and how about you?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT
oh lol

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT
that's like the extent of my spanish knowledge

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
you did that with french as well

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
oh

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
and

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
puedo ir al bano. idk how to spell that either. i can say it though

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
its not al lol

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
whatever

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
you know what i mean anyway

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
and i can say colours. but that's pretty useless

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
thas right, except for accents

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
i can count in spanish. i think

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
uno

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
i win!

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
i can count up to...

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
i can count pretty high actually

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
cien?

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
but i dont feel like going through all of it in my head to find out

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
but i can def go up to 29

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
i can't count that high in french

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
but i can in japanese

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
up to one hundred in japanese i think

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
probably a thousand

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
un deux trois quatre cinq six sept huit neuf dix onze douze treize quatorze quinze seize dix-sept dix-huit dix-neuf vingt. vingt et un vingt-deux vingt-trois vingt-quatre vingt-cinq vingt-six vingt-sept vingt-huit vingt-neuf trente

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
you now know how to count to thirty

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
exactly the same format as spanish

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
close spelling as well

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
ichi, ni, san, shi, go, roku, shichi, hachi, kyu, jyu.

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
1-10

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
then you just put 10-1,10-2, 10-3

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
jyu-ichi, jyu-ni

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
really easy

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
fantastic

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
i know

Nick Devlin June 4, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
fantastico!

Steph Dudak June 4, 2011 at 11:02pm EDT
area of a triangle is 1/2bh right?

Steph Dudak June 21, 2011 at 1:51am EDT

Steph Dudak June 21, 2011 at 1:51am EDT

Steph Dudak June 21, 2011 at 1:51am EDT
there was a class

Steph Dudak June 21, 2011 at 1:52am EDT

Steph Dudak June 21, 2011 at 1:52am EDT

Nick Devlin June 21, 2011 at 1:53am EDT

Nick Devlin June 21, 2011 at 1:53am EDT

Steph Dudak June 21, 2011 at 1:53am EDT
not mine

Steph Dudak June 21, 2011 at 1:53am EDT
well the first one

Steph Dudak June 21, 2011 at 1:55am EDT
in the dream, it was similar to the holocaust. but when i tell you about it, it's not similar really. yk what i mean? well basically, everyone is locked inside houses and if you left, you got killed. basically shot on site. there's cameras and shit everywhere. at one point, there was this person that asked a question and each time they did, the subject would disappear. so all the cameras, street lights, and other things from outside were gone

Steph Dudak June 21, 2011 at 1:55am EDT
and someone was like AW YEA WE CAN ESCAPE NOW!! WOMP WOMP WHOS DOWN

Steph Dudak June 21, 2011 at 1:55am EDT
but like no one wanted to go

Steph Dudak June 21, 2011 at 1:55am EDT
apparently there was this one place everyone could flee too

Steph Dudak June 21, 2011 at 1:55am EDT
but idk where bc like the entire US was locked inside their houses

Steph Dudak June 21, 2011 at 1:55am EDT
it was just terrible.

Steph Dudak June 21, 2011 at 1:56am EDT
the second one

Steph Dudak June 21, 2011 at 1:56am EDT

Nick Devlin June 21, 2011 at 1:56am EDT
funny dream

Steph Dudak June 21, 2011 at 1:56am EDT
so i was on a team with josh evans. and like a buncha other people from school & people i've never seen were on that team and another, whatever

Steph Dudak June 21, 2011 at 1:57am EDT
for whatever reason. it was this thing. it wasn;t even a full baseball field, it was this tiny little square. kinda the size of four , four square boxes. so think like a 4x4 yk.

Steph Dudak June 21, 2011 at 1:57am EDT
maybe a bit bigger than that

Nick Devlin June 21, 2011 at 1:57am EDT
i'm imagining

Steph Dudak June 21, 2011 at 1:57am EDT
but so this other team was up first. and we apparently had to win but idk why. and they were jjust kicking our asses. FOR LIKE A HALF HOUR THOUGH. we were all just standing there and they were running bases.

Steph Dudak June 21, 2011 at 1:58am EDT
and i was bored as hell and im like um when is the first inning gonna be over wtf?

Steph Dudak June 21, 2011 at 1:58am EDT

Steph Dudak June 21, 2011 at 1:58am EDT
and I DONT THINK WE EVEN WENT UP

Steph Dudak June 21, 2011 at 1:58am EDT
but then we switched positions and i went to first base and i couldn't catch any ball that went in that direction and i was pissed

Nick Devlin June 21, 2011 at 1:58am EDT
you should have practiced more in gym

Steph Dudak June 21, 2011 at 1:59am EDT
then there was this like tv thing off to the side, not even by the bases but if you ran to that it counted for something

Nick Devlin June 21, 2011 at 1:59am EDT
like moi

Steph Dudak June 21, 2011 at 1:59am EDT
and i was like wtf

Steph Dudak June 21, 2011 at 1:59am EDT

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 8:41pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 8:41pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 8:41pm EDT
what's difference?

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 8:41pm EDT
you'll have to figure that out when you go to make a character lol

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 8:42pm EDT
that'll take a while

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 8:42pm EDT
they're two different factions

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 8:42pm EDT
alliance races include:

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 8:42pm EDT
human, night elf, draenei (which all my alliance chars are, idk why lol. draenei male are ugly tho), uuuh. worgen, dwarf, gnomes

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 8:43pm EDT
and the different races have differnt abilities?

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 8:43pm EDT
after you pick a race, you need to pick a class

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 8:43pm EDT
and yes only certain races can be certain classes

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 8:43pm EDT
wowowow

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 8:43pm EDT

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 8:43pm EDT

*waiting*

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 8:44pm EDT
#5 says that there is locked software being downloaded to your computer that you aren't allowed to have access to, and

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 8:44pm EDT
#6 says that the game is allowed to moniter your actions on your computer and send info to blizzard whenever it wants

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 8:44pm EDT
WTF

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 8:45pm EDT
that will never happen

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 8:45pm EDT
dont matter

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 8:45pm EDT
its the thought that counts

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 8:45pm EDT
the evil thought

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 8:46pm EDT
what does all that even mean lol. i mean if you're like doing something that's affiliated with the game that you're not supposed to then that's different

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 8:46pm EDT
what is "locked software"

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 8:46pm EDT
just programs

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 8:47pm EDT
i'm guessing its unlockable sontent with special quests or whatever

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 8:47pm EDT
that you aren't allowed to immediatley obtain

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 8:47pm EDT
nothing bad really

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 8:50pm EDT
luckily with cata they redid the 1-60 questing so it's actually entertaining. but once you hit bc & wotlk questing it's not as fun. well imo. (but i've done bc questing like three times now.) but picks up again once you hit 80 and do cata questing. heh.

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 8:50pm EDT
gotcha, I can spend hours tearing down a mountain block by block

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 8:51pm EDT

Can you only get one job thing?

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 9:56pm EDT
two professions

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 9:56pm EDT
primary ones

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 9:57pm EDT
and all 3 secondary professions

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 9:57pm EDT
which are fishing, archaeology, and cooking

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 9:57pm EDT
alright, good otherwise I'd be maxing all of them out

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 9:57pm EDT
hahaha

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT
oh look all the professions are on that page too

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT
awesome

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT
oh 4 secondary

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT
i forgot first aid existed

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT
its dumb

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT
first aid is very imprtant

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
so which class gets all the animal stuff?

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
i guess if you don't have food

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
what do you mean animal stuff

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
as a hunter you can tame animals

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
but

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
like summoning

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
you can switch forms as a druid

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
YES

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
warlocks have pets too

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
minions

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
rather

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
um

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
actually

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
so do mages. they have a water elemental

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
druid or warlock

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
depends what you wanna do

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
see

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
warlock wears all cloth. they're only dps (damage). you get other pets as you go along the way

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
start with an imp, then whatever the blue thing is i can't think of

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
a succubus

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
and another guy

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 10:01pm EDT
druids though. are versatile. you can perform healer, tank, or dps roles

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 10:01pm EDT
and you get a million forms and wear leather armor

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 10:01pm EDT
well druids are natively celtic so I'm leaning towards that one

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 10:01pm EDT
bear form used for tanking. cat for feral dps. um. boomkin for dps. you dont get a form anymore for healing lol used to be a tree

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 10:02pm EDT
then you turn into a seal thing for your swimming form thing. and you have a flight form

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 10:02pm EDT
i played a druid up til about almost lvl 40 before i deleted it which was dumb. theyre fun

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 10:03pm EDT
so i can be a night elf, worgen, tauren or troll

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 10:03pm EDT
yep

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT
so night elf or worgen

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT
trolls and taurens look boring

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 10:05pm EDT
taurens are cow

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 10:05pm EDT
s

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 10:05pm EDT
um

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 10:05pm EDT
well

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 10:05pm EDT
worgen, theres even more forms! lol. cause you have a human form that you start off as before you turn into a worgen. so that's like all animal!

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 10:05pm EDT
it depends really

Steph Dudak June 25, 2011 at 10:05pm EDT
worgen is one of the newest classes

Nick Devlin June 25, 2011 at 10:05pm EDT

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:41pm EDT
what do you need help with lol

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 5:41pm EDT
items, just items in general

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 5:42pm EDT
how do i sell them, do i have to have them in that little bar for them to work

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:42pm EDT
okay well firstly

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:43pm EDT
as far as armor goes, equip leather items. if you hover over them (say if it's a quest reward) it'll show if it's an upgrade or not with green +__ numbers, etc.

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:43pm EDT
to sell all the junk in your bags, just find a vendor somewhere

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:43pm EDT
check that inn, that giant building that you ran around in where your trainer was

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:43pm EDT
if you hover over them it'll be a bag

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:43pm EDT
right click the vendor, then right click the stuff in your bags to sell it

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 5:44pm EDT
i found some people with anvils

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:44pm EDT
yeah

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:44pm EDT
theyre fine

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:44pm EDT
the guys with anvils, once you progress you'll have to repair armor

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 5:44pm EDT
so i right click and they'll just take it?

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:44pm EDT
you go to those guys

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:44pm EDT
yes

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:44pm EDT
also when you go to your trainer and learn new spells and such, they should just shoot straight to your actionbar amirite?

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 5:45pm EDT
yes

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 5:45pm EDT
you have no clue how long it took me to realize that i had to learn the spell by talking to the guy

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:45pm EDT
lmao

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:46pm EDT
imma make a lower level toon so i can help you. plus once you get to higher lvls, you'll be able to start dungeons

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:46pm EDT
and i suggest dpsing instead of trynna tank or heal or anything

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 5:46pm EDT
awesome

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 5:46pm EDT
dps is just an attack person?

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:46pm EDT
yes, dps = damage

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:47pm EDT
once you hit level 10 you're able to start filling out talent trees

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 5:47pm EDT
awesome

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 5:47pm EDT
r

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:47pm EDT
you can go either balance or feral for dps, but it'll tell you that once you get the option so it's nothin to really worry about

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:47pm EDT
and you can always google builds and shit so

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 5:48pm EDT
silver coins are 100 copper?

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:49pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 5:49pm EDT

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:50pm EDT
add Kirá to your friends list. i can make netherweave bags & send em to you. they're 16 slot bags so it'll be fine for now. extra bag space is always good lol

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 5:51pm EDT
cool

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 5:51pm EDT
can armour items stack?

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:51pm EDT
what do you mean?

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 5:52pm EDT
i got like 10 different shoes that give me differnt durability

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 5:52pm EDT
i i have like 3 of them on what happens?

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:52pm EDT
don't look at the durability on the items. you can only equip one

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:52pm EDT
look at stats, and the type of armor first

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:53pm EDT
durability is irrelevant

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 5:53pm EDT
...oh how do i get them out of that action bar at the bottom then?

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:53pm EDT
why are they in your action bar?

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 5:53pm EDT
why not?

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:53pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 5:53pm EDT

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:58pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 5:58pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 5:58pm EDT
i cant drag them out

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:58pm EDT
click, hold and drag them into your bag

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:58pm EDT
unless your action bar is locked, in which case you'll have to unlock it. you'll have to go tooo.... Interface > action bars for that i believe

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:58pm EDT
i think that exists lol

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:59pm EDT
idk why theyre there in the first place nicholas!

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 5:59pm EDT
i'm just messing around

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 5:59pm EDT
oh but if those ones in the screenshot are better than the ones you're wearing, equip em

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 5:59pm EDT
i'll try

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 6:00pm EDT
they prob arent though lol

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 6:00pm EDT
theyre gray nvm womp

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 6:00pm EDT
I got them out! yay

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 6:01pm EDT
wooo!

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 6:01pm EDT
now how do i equip them, and get rid of old armour and junk?

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 6:01pm EDT
you just right click on em

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 6:02pm EDT
but dont do that if you're talking to a vendor, cause the nyoull just sell it lol

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 6:02pm EDT
hover over the item & press the shift key to see if itll be an upgrade

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 6:02pm EDT
yeah it's good

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 6:02pm EDT
at this point that'll be told by just how much armor an item has. and if it's green and says +__ armor or something then equip it. then just sell the old armor that it swapped

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 6:03pm EDT
what do you mean equip?

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 6:03pm EDT
i don't see an option for that

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 6:04pm EDT
you just asked me how to EQUIP items

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 6:04pm EDT
YES I DID

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 6:04pm EDT
when you right click on it, you equip it.

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 6:04pm EDT
if an item is an upgrade, it should be equipped.

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 6:05pm EDT
once you equip it, the old piece of armor you had on before that, will go into your bag. you then sell that old piece of armor, bc it's useless

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 6:05pm EDT
right click left click, WHY can't i remember the difference

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 6:05pm EDT
thanks

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 6:05pm EDT
XD

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 6:05pm EDT
sure sure

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 6:06pm EDT
okay one of these things says i dont have the proficcency to wear it

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 6:06pm EDT
if it's anything higher than leather you can't

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 6:07pm EDT
which includes mail & plate

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 6:07pm EDT
you can wear cloth, but don't.

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 6:07pm EDT
hoe do igain proficeny? leveling up?

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 6:07pm EDT
you will never be able to wear anything other than leather.

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 6:07pm EDT
...ever?

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 6:07pm EDT
because of your class

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 6:07pm EDT
ever

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 6:08pm EDT
let me explain:

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 6:08pm EDT
ahh, i better get some badass leather armour then

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 6:10pm EDT
there are cloth wearing classes. this includes priests, mages, and warlocks. that's all they can wear. then there are classes that wear medium armor: leather. this includes druids and rogues. and hunters at low levels. shaman wear leather at lower levels, but i THINK they may be able to wear mail come 40.. so same as hunters. don't quote me on that though. then there's mail. paladins, warriors.. they learn plate at level 40. and death knights wear plate as well. (death knights start at level 55 so they automatically start with plate)

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 6:10pm EDT
am i forgetting a class in there? idk hopefully not

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 6:11pm EDT
alright, so if the thing is red i can't wear it?

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 6:11pm EDT
correctt

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 6:11pm EDT
so when offered items for completing quests, i shouldn't pick those

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 6:12pm EDT
unless i want to sell the fo mony

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 6:12pm EDT
yes

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 6:12pm EDT
i was just gonna bring that u plol

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 6:12pm EDT
up *

Steph Dudak June 26, 2011 at 6:12pm EDT
if there isn't any leather available as a quest reward, or it just isn't an upgrade, go for whichever sells for more and just sell it

Nick Devlin June 26, 2011 at 6:13pm EDT
gotcha

Nick Devlin June 27, 2011 at 11:43am EDT
I spent far to long playing that game last night

Steph Dudak June 27, 2011 at 12:07pm EDT
how long?

Nick Devlin June 27, 2011 at 12:07pm EDT
hmm not sure let me think

Nick Devlin June 27, 2011 at 12:07pm EDT
i know i stopped around 2

Nick Devlin June 27, 2011 at 12:07pm EDT
but i'm not sure when i started

Nick Devlin June 27, 2011 at 12:08pm EDT
probably 7 or 8

Nick Devlin June 27, 2011 at 12:08pm EDT
so 4 or 5 hours maybe?

Steph Dudak June 27, 2011 at 12:08pm EDT
oh man haha. what level are you now?

Nick Devlin June 27, 2011 at 12:08pm EDT
8

Steph Dudak June 27, 2011 at 12:08pm EDT
it's easy to spend a lot of time in that game though

Nick Devlin June 27, 2011 at 12:08pm EDT
its not as bad as minecraft, yet

Nick Devlin June 27, 2011 at 12:09pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 27, 2011 at 12:19pm EDT
i HATE walking

Nick Devlin June 27, 2011 at 12:20pm EDT

Steph Dudak June 27, 2011 at 12:20pm EDT
yeah you get a travel form. and at 20 you get a mount

Nick Devlin June 27, 2011 at 12:22pm EDT
oh look level 10

Nick Devlin June 27, 2011 at 12:22pm EDT
Im awesome

Steph Dudak June 27, 2011 at 12:22pm EDT
wooo!

Steph Dudak June 27, 2011 at 12:22pm EDT
soleil is officially gone x.x

Nick Devlin June 27, 2011 at 12:22pm EDT
aww

Steph Dudak June 27, 2011 at 12:23pm EDT
i haven't played her in months. i think it's safe to say i wasn't ever going to

Steph Dudak June 27, 2011 at 12:23pm EDT
hunters are boring

Nick Devlin June 27, 2011 at 12:24pm EDT
which are funnest?

Steph Dudak June 27, 2011 at 12:25pm EDT
don't ask me on that one. i've only fully leveled a paladin. and my priest is 65. i think both of those are fun to play

Steph Dudak June 27, 2011 at 12:25pm EDT
actually. here's a fun backstory. Soleil was originally a shaman, but kelly deleted her

Steph Dudak June 27, 2011 at 12:26pm EDT
my sister likes to make thousands of characters on different servers and like, doesnt play them. so i deleted those level like 1-3 characters. and soleil was about lvl 10ish and she deleted her cause she was mad.

Nick Devlin June 27, 2011 at 12:26pm EDT
HhHaah

Steph Dudak June 27, 2011 at 12:26pm EDT
druids are fun too though. i played one up til about lvl 40

Steph Dudak June 27, 2011 at 12:26pm EDT
other than that i've played only a little of other classes

Steph Dudak June 27, 2011 at 12:26pm EDT
so

Nick Devlin June 27, 2011 at 12:27pm EDT
alright

Nick Devlin June 27, 2011 at 12:28pm EDT
this game is getting exponentially easier

Nick Devlin June 27, 2011 at 12:28pm EDT
lvl 11

Steph Dudak June 27, 2011 at 12:30pm EDT
gogogo!

Nick Devlin June 27, 2011 at 12:32pm EDT
oh!

Nick Devlin June 27, 2011 at 12:32pm EDT
what talent do i pick?

Steph Dudak June 27, 2011 at 12:33pm EDT
have you read the overview things for each spec?

Steph Dudak June 27, 2011 at 12:33pm EDT
cause it depends. balance is a ranged dps. but you can also go feral dps, which is melee

Nick Devlin June 27, 2011 at 12:33pm EDT
i like the animals forms, but hitting people from 100 feet away is so much easier...

Steph Dudak June 27, 2011 at 12:34pm EDT
and feral dps you need to be a cat like all the time. eventually, if you go balance, you get this form h.o

Nick Devlin June 27, 2011 at 12:34pm EDT
well i already am a cat all the time

Steph Dudak June 27, 2011 at 12:34pm EDT
http://www.moonkin.net/moonkin.jpg

Nick Devlin June 27, 2011 at 12:35pm EDT
wtf is that?

Steph Dudak June 27, 2011 at 12:36pm EDT
a moonkin

Nick Devlin June 27, 2011 at 12:36pm EDT
well i'm not going balance!

Steph Dudak June 27, 2011 at 12:37pm EDT
lmao

Steph Dudak June 27, 2011 at 12:37pm EDT
so i guess you're going feral dps. you use energy for that instead of mana

Nick Devlin June 27, 2011 at 12:37pm EDT
orange var not blue?

Steph Dudak June 27, 2011 at 12:37pm EDT
yellow

Steph Dudak June 27, 2011 at 12:41pm EDT
http://fluiddruid.net/the-fluid-druid-4-0-1-cataclysm-feral-dps-guide/ May be helpful in deciding where to put talents, how to use em, etc. stats, blahblah. won't be too crucial at your level. but it's good to know what stats you're lookin for on armor

Nick Devlin June 27, 2011 at 12:42pm EDT
Awesome

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:00pm EDT
hi

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:00pm EDT
!

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:01pm EDT
HI

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:01pm EDT
My internet is down!

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:01pm EDT
that's really unfortunate

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:02pm EDT
but for some reason it works

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:02pm EDT
its really weird

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:02pm EDT
i can only click links

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:02pm EDT
that makes no sense

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:02pm EDT
i know!

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:05pm EDT
I can

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:07pm EDT
got distracted and forget end to that sentence

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:07pm EDT
another uick question anout WoW

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:08pm EDT
yes?

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:08pm EDT
What do i do now?

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:08pm EDT
what do you mean?

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:08pm EDT
i got a bunch of animal forms, complete a bunch of quest, rode a hippogriff to some random place

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:08pm EDT
it won't let me do anything there

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:09pm EDT
not much else i can find to do

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:09pm EDT
no quests there?

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:09pm EDT
have you checked your quest log?

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:09pm EDT
i can't kill anything

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:09pm EDT
where?

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:09pm EDT
i will check name

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:10pm EDT
Moon glade

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:10pm EDT
lol you're not supposed to be able to kill anything there

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:10pm EDT
just go back to where you were before you went to moonglade

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:10pm EDT
did you get some weird ability thing that lets you port there?

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:11pm EDT
nope just talked to one of the hippogriff people and clicked a random place on the map

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:11pm EDT
-.-.

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:11pm EDT
well why would you do that lol

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:12pm EDT
continue questing. you can also start using the dungeon finder. but sometimes the people aren't the nicest haha

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:12pm EDT
queue in as dps of course

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:12pm EDT
so just keep finding more exlamation points?

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:13pm EDT
yes, those would be quests. or start using the dungeon finder. oodles of fun. what level are you?

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:13pm EDT
16

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:14pm EDT
wonderful

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:17pm EDT
sarcastic or genuine?

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:17pm EDT
genuine

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:20pm EDT
all right so if i change form do i still have the stats i get from armour?

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:21pm EDT
please elaborate

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:23pm EDT
i have like pants of nazirath or something that gives me +12 armour

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:23pm EDT
i turn to bear form

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:23pm EDT
do i still have the +12

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:23pm EDT
yeah

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:23pm EDT
awesom

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:23pm EDT
whatever armor you're wearing, that's the stats you get

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:23pm EDT
that's also why at higher levels, if you dual spec, you're required to have different gear sets

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:23pm EDT
like

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:23pm EDT
if you plan to tank and dps, you need to different sets of gear

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:24pm EDT
like for example, i have a tanking spec. so i need things with parry, dodge, and mastery on them. as opposed to my dps spec which is filled with crit, hit, mastery, etc.

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:25pm EDT
bear form is used for tanking btw

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:25pm EDT
i usually use the cat

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:25pm EDT
good good

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:26pm EDT
i really like the prowl thing that makes enemies ignore me

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:27pm EDT
haha i bet

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:27pm EDT
well i must go, so any other questions?

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:27pm EDT
not that i can think of, thanks!

Nick Devlin June 30, 2011 at 2:28pm EDT
see ya

Steph Dudak June 30, 2011 at 2:28pm EDT

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:10pm EDT
well that's not it

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:11pm EDT
WHY are you dying?

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:11pm EDT
is it just mobs? or are you running into areas where you get flagged for pvp

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:11pm EDT
the monsters are the same level as me and i have bad strategy?

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:11pm EDT
and how many are you going for at once?

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:11pm EDT
usually 1

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:11pm EDT
then 5 more find me

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:12pm EDT
wait

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:12pm EDT
i can say mobs instead of monsters

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:12pm EDT
i thought that was only minecraft for some reason

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:12pm EDT
haha

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:12pm EDT
well thats an issue. you should really look where you're running into first

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:13pm EDT
you can generally see a wide range in front of you and where others are

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:13pm EDT
that way you can decide which you should actually target

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:13pm EDT
and you can heal yourself in combat

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:13pm EDT
i mean you dont always need to be in cat form

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:13pm EDT
i know

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:13pm EDT
but i'm not good at changing form in battle

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:14pm EDT
and the human form does little to no damage anymore

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:14pm EDT
well noticeable damage anyway

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:14pm EDT
which spells are you using

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:14pm EDT
...hmm

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:15pm EDT
i usually use some magic attack to start with when they are far away a couple times

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:15pm EDT
then use this thorn thing that protects me

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:15pm EDT
from melee

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:15pm EDT
tthan i use instant speel that does medium damage

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:15pm EDT
until they die

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
okay that does not help me at all

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
i know

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
but if you're gonna use thorns i'd start off with that

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
i tried

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
then use... whatever else there is..

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
you have what

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
thanks!

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
wrath, starfall?

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
starfall

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
first

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
then wrath when they are close

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
is starfall an instant cast?

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
no

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
or is it channeled or what?

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:17pm EDT
i have two that are really similar, one is an instant cast that does little damage

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:17pm EDT
the other takes acouple damage but does a lot

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:17pm EDT
takes a couple seconds*

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:18pm EDT
hm

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:18pm EDT
you should learn the names of your spells loll hold on

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:18pm EDT
i'm not on my normal computer so i can't check

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:19pm EDT
http://www.wowhead.com/spells=7.11.574

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:19pm EDT
balance abilities

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:19pm EDT
http://www.wowhead.com/spells=7.11.134

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:19pm EDT
feral abilities

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:20pm EDT
alright so for balanced I use:

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:21pm EDT
-starfire before they notice me since it takes forever to load -thorns while they are on way to attack me -spam moonfire until they die with occaional wrath when i'm bored

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:21pm EDT
feral:

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:23pm EDT
-rake -mangle a bunch of times for combo -Ferocious bite -mangle a bunch of times for combo -ferocious bite until they die

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:24pm EDT
thats it

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:24pm EDT
you dont ever use claw?

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:24pm EDT
no its the same as mangle just weaker

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:24pm EDT
i think

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:25pm EDT
i'm probably wrong though

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:25pm EDT
well i dunno the percents at your level lol so. but

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:27pm EDT
make sure when you're using mangle, that rake is up on your target. rake does additional bleed dmg over 9 sec? and the target takes a certain % (idk if its 30 for you rn, but it is at 85 soo whatever percent it is) additional damage from bleed effects for a minute. as far as your balance abilities go, take care of all your casting spells first

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:28pm EDT
i'd* take care of

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:28pm EDT
that's just me

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:28pm EDT
so like

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:28pm EDT
starfire and thorns okay. you can throw up entangling roots while youre casting wrath

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:28pm EDT
and then moonfire/wrath/ etc whatever

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:28pm EDT
oh right thats slows enemy yeah?

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:29pm EDT
entangling roots entangles them in roots

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:29pm EDT
thanks!

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:29pm EDT
which are broken once dmg is done

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:29pm EDT
and then in between if youre running low on health you can cast rejuvenation, cause it's instant

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:29pm EDT
it'll heal you over time

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:30pm EDT
aight

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:30pm EDT
i think once you get to level 30, you can dual spec

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:30pm EDT
damn i guess i need to buy this now

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:31pm EDT
WAIT

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:31pm EDT
?!?!?!

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:31pm EDT
you are filling out your talent tree along the way right?

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:31pm EDT
yeah...

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:31pm EDT
everytime you get a new point available

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:31pm EDT
okay

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:31pm EDT
just making sure

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:31pm EDT
i am

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:31pm EDT
i can just ignore bear stuff right??

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:31pm EDT
i really dont like the bear

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:32pm EDT
that's the idea

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:32pm EDT
awesome

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:32pm EDT
idk how the feral tree works really as far as talent points go

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:32pm EDT
are there separate talents for bear form & cat form?

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:32pm EDT
yeah some

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:33pm EDT
some increase attack for either form

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:33pm EDT
i think thats what it was saying

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:33pm EDT
oh!

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:33pm EDT
you don't like japanese girl explains avatar?!?

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:34pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:36pm EDT
sigh you'll never understand true art

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:36pm EDT
thanks for chart

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:37pm EDT
i'll probably have to double check on that. talent builds are a pain in the ass but that may work alright. you can always redo em idk. i understand true art perfectly fine

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:37pm EDT
at least you got Dot Dot Dot

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:39pm EDT
beacuase that is the best thing ever

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:39pm EDT
BEACUASE

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:39pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:39pm EDT
i need to pronounce it that way from now on

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:39pm EDT

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:42pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:43pm EDT

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:43pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:43pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:44pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:44pm EDT

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:44pm EDT

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:44pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:44pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:45pm EDT
If you are able to read the story though, it is the most hilarious thing I've ever read

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:45pm EDT
ever

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:46pm EDT
For example today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets and black combat boots. I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner and red eye shadow. I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of preps stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:46pm EDT
lmao

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:47pm EDT
the entire story is like that, and it only gets better as you keep reading

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:47pm EDT
i particularly love the author' notes

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:47pm EDT
damn preps

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:47pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:47pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:48pm EDT
My favorite part of the entire story

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:48pm EDT
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING YOU MOTHERFUKERS! It was.Dumbledore!

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:50pm EDT
The next day I woke up in my bedroom. It was snowing and raining again. I opened the door of my coffin and drank some blood from a bottle I had.

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:50pm EDT
hahahaha wtf

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:51pm EDT
i love this story eepecially the constant hypocrisy of hating mainstream prepz while loving my chemical romance and hot topic

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:51pm EDT
I gasped. Chapter 3.

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:51pm EDT
i like the abrupt endings

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:51pm EDT
this is hilarious

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:52pm EDT
glad to know you agree

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:52pm EDT
just wait till you see the main characters

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:52pm EDT
I felt a little depressed then, so I slit one of my wrists

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:52pm EDT
XD

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:52pm EDT

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:52pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:52pm EDT

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:52pm EDT
I read a depressing book while I waited for it to stop bleeding and I listened to some GC.

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:53pm EDT
i can't even

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:53pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:53pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:53pm EDT
Hi Draco! I said in a depressed voice

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:54pm EDT
i didn't know shouting was depressing

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:54pm EDT
Draco and I crawled back into the Mercedes-Benz, but Draco didnt go back into Hogwarts, instead he drove the car into the Forbidden Forest! Chapter 4.

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:55pm EDT
what's gunna happen next?!!

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:55pm EDT
apparently shes gonna yell at draco

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:55pm EDT
Draco leaned in extra-close and I looked into his gothic red eyes (he was wearing color contacts) which revealed so much depressing sorrow and evilness and then suddenly I didnt feel mad anymore

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:55pm EDT
nope

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:55pm EDT
she's not

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:55pm EDT
lmao

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:56pm EDT
dumbledore had a headache that day

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:56pm EDT
You ludacris fools! he shouted. I started to cry tears of blood down my pallid face.

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:56pm EDT
that mediocre dunce

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:57pm EDT
BTW I wont rite da nxt chapter til I git TIN god vons!

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 7:58pm EDT
My names Harry Potter, although most people call me Vampire these days. he grumbled. Why? I exclaimed. Because I love the taste of human blood. he giggled.

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:58pm EDT
so glad she got tin god vons

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 7:58pm EDT
just for that line

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:00pm EDT
i like how it just switched perspective wtf

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:01pm EDT
it took a couple reads through each chapter just to kno what the hell is happening

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:01pm EDT
Then all of a suddenly, an horrible man with red eyes and no nose and everything started flying towards me on a broomstick!

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:01pm EDT
all of a suddenly

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:02pm EDT
i just love that voldemort has shakespearean speech patterns

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:03pm EDT
Voldemort got a dude-ur-so-retarded look on his face. I hath telekinesis. he answered cruelly. And if you doth not kill Vampire, then thou know what will happen to Draco! he shouted. Then he flew away angrily on his broomstick.

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:03pm EDT
he angrily flew away

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:03pm EDT
angrily

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:04pm EDT
and Vampire was probably watching a depressing movie like The Corpse Bride.

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:04pm EDT
that movie isn't depressing though

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:04pm EDT
it is when your GOFFIK

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:04pm EDT
Emily is free at the end

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:05pm EDT
and victor and victoria get married and the guy that killed emily dies so all is well

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:06pm EDT
shh don't tell here that

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:07pm EDT
her*

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:07pm EDT
What the fuck do you think? I asked angrily. And then I said. Well, Voldemort came and the fucking bastard told me to fucking kill Harry! But I dont want to kill him, because, hes really nice, even if he did go out with Draco. But if I dont kill Harry, then Voldemort, will fucking kill Draco! I burst into tears. Suddenly Draco jumped out from behind a wall.

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:07pm EDT
i guess his name is harry now

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:08pm EDT
don't ever try to point out flaws in the writing and plot

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:08pm EDT
it is a bottomless pit you will never escape

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:08pm EDT
Ebony Draco has been found in his room. He committed suicide by slitting his wrists.

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:08pm EDT
i can see that haha

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:09pm EDT
completely ignore this line when you read that though

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:09pm EDT
I knew Draco was probably slitting his wrists (he wouldnt die because he was a vampire too and the only way you can kill a vampire is with a c-r-o-s-s (theres no way Im writing that) or a steak)

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:09pm EDT
Abra Kedavra! he yelled at Snape and Loopin pointing his womb. I took my gun and shot Snape and Loopin a gazillion times and they both started screaming and the camera broke. Suddenly, Dumblydore ran in. Ebony, it has been revealed that someone has - NOOOOOOOOOOOOO! he shouted looking at Snape and Loopin and then he waved his wand and suddenly

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:10pm EDT
haha i know

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:10pm EDT
...?

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:10pm EDT
that's what i just read

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:10pm EDT
i need to know what happens after the elipisis!

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:10pm EDT
apparently hagrid is a satanist

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:11pm EDT
of course he is

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:11pm EDT
he's also a pedophile

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:12pm EDT
but not really since he's younger in this version

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:13pm EDT
omg

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:14pm EDT
the spelling and grammar is just getting worse and worse i can't handle it

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:14pm EDT
oh yeah

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:14pm EDT
raven is her editor

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:14pm EDT
eventually they get into an arguement or something

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:14pm EDT
Then I put on black fishnets and black high-heeled boots with pictures of Billie Joe Armstrong on them.

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:14pm EDT
so raven stop fixing all the errors

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:14pm EDT
why would those even exist

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:15pm EDT
for teh goffiks!!

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:16pm EDT
I thought you didnt have a scar anymore! I shouted. I do but Diabolo changed it into a pentagram for me and I always cover it up with foundation. he said back. Anyway my scar hurt and then I had a vision of what was happening to Draco.Volfemort has him bondage!

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:16pm EDT
THIS ALREADY HAPPENED

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:16pm EDT
i know!

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:17pm EDT
i love how you point out everything articles explaining this story point out

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:19pm EDT
I just wanna be with you ok Draco! Why couldnt Satan have made me less beautiful?

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:19pm EDT
wait

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:19pm EDT
it sounds dreadful

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:19pm EDT
now she's yelling at draco

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:19pm EDT
but he didn't do anything

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:20pm EDT
he's standing there isn't he?

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:20pm EDT
thats enough

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:20pm EDT
clearly

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:20pm EDT
and she's mad at him cause she thinks he's like in love with harry. vampire. whoeverthefuck

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:20pm EDT
what chapter you on?

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:20pm EDT
but she's like I have a marilyn manson key that reminds me of how hot vampire and draco are

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:21pm EDT
15

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:21pm EDT
then i can show you this one

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:21pm EDT
No. he said meanly. I dont give a darn what Voldemort does to Draco. Not after how much he misbehaved in school especially with YOU Ebony. he said while he frowned looking at me. Besides I never liked him that much anyway. then he walked away.

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:21pm EDT
i never liked him very much, voldemort can kill him

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:21pm EDT
I took a razor and started to slit my wrists. I drank the blood all depressed.

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:21pm EDT
why bother

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:21pm EDT
the FEEL something

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
Then I looked at my black GC watch and noticed it was time to go to Biology class.

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
YOU GO TO HOGWARTS

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
THERE IS NO BIOLOGY

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
hahahahaha

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
I did sum advanced Biology work. I was turning a bloody pentagram into a black guitar. Suddenly the guitar turned to Draco!

Steph Dudak July 3, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
cause that makes so much sense

Nick Devlin July 3, 2011 at 8:23pm EDT

He was wearing black baggy paints, a black MCR t-shirt and a black die. (geddit insted of tie koz im goffik) I was wearing a blak leather low cut top with chains all over it all over it a blak leather mini, black high held boots and a cross belly fing. My hair was al up in a messy relly high bun like Amy Lee in Gong Under. (email me if u wana see da pik) Accuse me? What about me! I growled. Buy-but-but- he grunted. You fucking bastard! I moaned. No! Wait! Its not what it fucking looks like! he shouted. But it was to late. I knew what I herd. I ran to the bathroom angrily, cring.

Nick Devlin July 17, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT
sure!

Nick Devlin July 17, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT
what do you get for completing quest?

Steph Dudak July 17, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
in general? or these? cause from these dailies you get around i wanna say 16g per quest and then a mark of the world tree.

Nick Devlin July 17, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
i meant what do you get for the world tree wuest

Nick Devlin July 17, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
what do marks do?

Steph Dudak July 17, 2011 at 10:44pm EDT
well these marks are for another quest. you get 16 g along with that too. but i did another quest just like this (so it's 300 total marks) and i guess it goes to restoring this tree in game. cause yaknow, firelands! rawr everythings being destroyed. druids need help. i'm assuming somethings gonna happen once i finish this quest but idk

Steph Dudak July 17, 2011 at 10:44pm EDT

Steph Dudak July 17, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT

Steph Dudak July 17, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 17, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
thats a lot of well organized little squares you have

Steph Dudak July 17, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
all of my wonderful abilities

Steph Dudak July 17, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
not having to switch between action bars

Nick Devlin July 17, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
you can do that?!

Steph Dudak July 17, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
recount's actually working now

Nick Devlin July 17, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
wtf

Steph Dudak July 17, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
do what?

Nick Devlin July 17, 2011 at 10:50pm EDT
have it so you dont awitch action bars

Nick Devlin July 17, 2011 at 10:50pm EDT
switch*

Steph Dudak July 17, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT
what no i mean. you know how you have action bar 1, like the main one? and then if you press the up or down arrow on the side (or shift+down/up on your keyboard) it goes to actionbar 2 or 6? i used to have to do that to use certain abilities

Steph Dudak July 17, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT
but you can also

Steph Dudak July 17, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT
put one of those bars on top, if you go to the WoW interface and go to actionbars or whatever

Steph Dudak July 17, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
and check the box for right or left. and that's one of em. so it'll show up on top of the main one

Nick Devlin July 17, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
that would have been really useful

Steph Dudak July 17, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
but even still. that's why i downloaded bartender 4. because i can put all of em together, keybind whatever i have to, and it's all right there and neat

Steph Dudak July 17, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
but

Steph Dudak July 17, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
if you're switching specs/forms or whatever (in your case) your abilities in your actionbars are going to change.

Steph Dudak July 17, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
because of the fact that you can't use balance abilities while you're in cat form

Nick Devlin July 17, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
i know that its kind of annoying

Nick Devlin July 17, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
ti can use any talents or whatever they're called either

Steph Dudak July 17, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
you can only be in one spec at a time lol. if you're specced balance you shouldn't really have to be using any feral abilities and vice versa. that's why it's a main spec. and then when you want to use a different one you can switch to your off spec (once youre even able to dual spec at 30)

Nick Devlin July 17, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
Does this chat thing do the same as messaging?

Steph Dudak July 17, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
yes?

Nick Devlin July 17, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
Awesome

Nick Devlin July 17, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
On iPod now

Steph Dudak July 17, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
lol wonderful

Steph Dudak July 17, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
i hate using fb on my ipod

Nick Devlin July 17, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
It is a form of torture in some countries I believe

Steph Dudak July 17, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
i wouldnt doubt it

Nick Devlin July 17, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
Did I mention Doug got put in time out for 15 minutes?

Nick Devlin July 17, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
Cause he did

Nick Devlin July 17, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
It's hilarious

Steph Dudak July 17, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 17, 2011 at 11:12pm EDT
I don't question his lack of knowledge of computers or tell him about it

Nick Devlin July 17, 2011 at 11:12pm EDT
I just exploit it mercilessly

Nick Devlin July 17, 2011 at 11:12pm EDT
Is what that was meant to say

Steph Dudak July 17, 2011 at 11:13pm EDT
right

Nick Devlin July 17, 2011 at 11:13pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 18, 2011 at 1:25am EDT
Anything exciting on your end?

Steph Dudak July 18, 2011 at 1:27am EDT

Nick Devlin July 18, 2011 at 7:17am EDT
I never watch tv, but its the principle of the thing, you know.

Nick Devlin July 18, 2011 at 7:18am EDT
TV is for hooking up video games to and watching netflix on.

Steph Dudak July 18, 2011 at 2:04pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 18, 2011 at 11:56pm EDT

Steph Dudak July 19, 2011 at 12:17am EDT

Steph Dudak July 19, 2011 at 12:17am EDT
when you have 8 minute songs stuck in your head

Steph Dudak July 19, 2011 at 12:18am EDT
and you can only listen to 8 minute songs in a row so many times

Nick Devlin July 19, 2011 at 12:18am EDT
and you start signing it but can't remember most of the lyrics

Nick Devlin July 19, 2011 at 12:18am EDT
tand its really annoying

Steph Dudak July 19, 2011 at 12:19am EDT
depending on the song, yes

Steph Dudak July 19, 2011 at 12:19am EDT
although

Nick Devlin July 19, 2011 at 12:19am EDT
well if its like free bird you can get it

Steph Dudak July 19, 2011 at 12:19am EDT
it'd be worse if you had Octivarium by Dream Theater stuck in your head

Steph Dudak July 19, 2011 at 12:19am EDT
it's 24 mins long

Steph Dudak July 19, 2011 at 12:19am EDT
and yeah lol i've had free bird stuck in my head

Nick Devlin July 19, 2011 at 12:20am EDT

Steph Dudak July 19, 2011 at 12:20am EDT
XD

Steph Dudak July 19, 2011 at 12:20am EDT

Steph Dudak July 19, 2011 at 12:58am EDT
you guess letters, but you have so many strikes

Nick Devlin July 19, 2011 at 12:58am EDT
ahh

Steph Dudak July 19, 2011 at 12:58am EDT
once all strikes are used up, if you don't guess the word, you lose a balloon

Steph Dudak July 19, 2011 at 12:58am EDT
the point is to keep your balloons

Nick Devlin July 19, 2011 at 12:58am EDT
gotcha

Steph Dudak July 19, 2011 at 12:58am EDT
otherwise you fall into what looks like a giant pit of lava..

Nick Devlin July 19, 2011 at 12:59am EDT

Steph Dudak July 19, 2011 at 12:59am EDT

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 9:33pm EDT
yep

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 9:33pm EDT
no one else wants to learn since its pretty complex

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
there are more hostile mobs in the nether

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
which is pretty much hell

Steph Dudak July 29, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT
daayuum

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT
things like Ghasts

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 9:45pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT

Steph Dudak July 29, 2011 at 9:57pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 9:57pm EDT
diamond armor

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 9:57pm EDT

Steph Dudak July 29, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT
yeo

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT
tlava burns you

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT
burning kills

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT
all items are dropped

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT
and lava destroys dropped items

Steph Dudak July 29, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
very realistic

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
yep

Steph Dudak July 29, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
that's really unfortunate though lol

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
thats why mods are fun!

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
to take away realism

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
anyway

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
normally when you die all you items are just sitting there on the ground and you can go back and pick them up

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 10:02pm EDT
but lava and cacuts destroy dropped items

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 10:02pm EDT
cactus*

Steph Dudak July 29, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT
cacti destroyes stuff..?

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 10:05pm EDT
yep

Steph Dudak July 29, 2011 at 10:07pm EDT
how?

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 10:07pm EDT
just coming in contact with the block makes the item disapear

Steph Dudak July 29, 2011 at 10:08pm EDT
powerful cacti

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 10:08pm EDT
wellyep

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 10:08pm EDT
i hate when i forget to erase what i previously typing

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 10:09pm EDT
yes, catus are pretty dangerous

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 10:09pm EDT
very useful for making traps though

Steph Dudak July 29, 2011 at 10:11pm EDT
yayay cactus traps!

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 10:11pm EDT
I love making traps

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 10:12pm EDT
someone steps on a pressure pad

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 10:12pm EDT
casuing the block beneath them to drop

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 10:13pm EDT
then the blocks surrounding them block off an exit

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 10:13pm EDT
and lava falls from ceiling

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 10:13pm EDT
>:D muahahahah

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
it would also taste a lot better

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT

Steph Dudak July 29, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
Haha too lazy. My life. I like food that can be ready in 2 minutes

Nick Devlin July 29, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 1, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 1, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
any ideas on the materials?

Nick Devlin August 1, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
so i can get ready now

Steph Dudak August 1, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
Any rare metal you can get your hands on would be a good start. Power tools. Um

Steph Dudak August 1, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
A forge maybe

Steph Dudak August 1, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
Electrical tape

Nick Devlin August 1, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
well I could just import those from minecraft then use a 3-D printer i suppose

Nick Devlin August 1, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
been meaning to get some electrical tape anyway

Steph Dudak August 1, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
You'll need to have two large antennas

Nick Devlin August 1, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
aight

Nick Devlin August 1, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
anything else?

Steph Dudak August 1, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
There's other unnamed materials but they'll be included in the blueprint package

Nick Devlin August 1, 2011 at 10:58pm EDT
of course

Nick Devlin August 1, 2011 at 10:58pm EDT
can't let that kind of info get into the cloud

Steph Dudak August 1, 2011 at 10:58pm EDT
Oh. And you'll need a level and a pencil

Nick Devlin August 1, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
well those are a given in any extra-dimensional transportation device

Steph Dudak August 1, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
Yeah but some people tend to forget their importance and just ignore it. *shrugs*

Nick Devlin August 1, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
not very bright people

Nick Devlin August 1, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
and i really need to find the italicize setup on this chat

Steph Dudak August 1, 2011 at 11:02pm EDT
You're telling me. But this is why we don't have things like time machines, hover cars, and other teleportation devices. People ignore the smallest, yet important things. That, and the general public wouldn't be prepared for such technology.

Steph Dudak August 1, 2011 at 11:02pm EDT
Any of such that exists is kept hidden for a reason

Nick Devlin August 1, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT
well i think we pretty much forgot how to go to the moon, they had to call in one of those 90 year old guys who did it the first time, cause none of the new people knew how

Nick Devlin August 1, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT
laziness

Steph Dudak August 1, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT
Kids these days omg

Nick Devlin August 1, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
ikr

Nick Devlin August 1, 2011 at 11:09pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 1, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 1, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 1, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 1, 2011 at 11:26pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 1, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 1, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 1, 2011 at 11:34pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 1, 2011 at 11:34pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 1, 2011 at 11:35pm EDT
Hahaha that's awesome

Nick Devlin August 1, 2011 at 11:38pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 1, 2011 at 11:39pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 1, 2011 at 11:40pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 1, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 1, 2011 at 11:46pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 1, 2011 at 11:47pm EDT
but i don't know anyone thats good at parallel parking

Steph Dudak August 1, 2011 at 11:49pm EDT
Are you serious? That's awful. And yeah I'm hopefully good enough to pass lol

Nick Devlin August 1, 2011 at 11:57pm EDT
well i just found out the sail party is same day as band camp

Nick Devlin August 1, 2011 at 11:57pm EDT
which also is awful

Nick Devlin August 1, 2011 at 11:57pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 1, 2011 at 11:58pm EDT
Band camp

Nick Devlin August 1, 2011 at 11:58pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 12:00am EDT

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 12:01am EDT
stretching is tortuous, but at least i can see doug doing worse than me

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 12:01am EDT
drum majors go to most colorguard practices >:D

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 12:01am EDT
and i suck less than some other people

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 12:01am EDT
so its all good

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
Hahaha that sounds wonderful

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 12:05am EDT

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 12:05am EDT

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 12:05am EDT
Really? XD that's funny

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 12:06am EDT
that it is

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 12:11am EDT

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 12:11am EDT
Why

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 12:12am EDT

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 12:13am EDT

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 12:14am EDT
You have a heart

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 12:15am EDT
lies, I have a brain

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 12:15am EDT
alayna is still my main source of rides home

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 12:17am EDT
Ah. So you really have no feelings. Just some common sense. Be mean and make fun of your ride home = no more ride home.

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 12:17am EDT
i'm the tinman not the scarecrow in this scenario

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 12:17am EDT

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 12:17am EDT
Hahahaha Yess

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 12:19am EDT

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
I do that to my mom. I'll say something and real quick go "just kidding love you" and it's like nothing happened. Depending what I said beforehand.

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 12:25am EDT

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 12:28am EDT
she was arguing with someone on the pronunciaton od 'zebra'

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 12:28am EDT
and Alayna started going on a tirade about how stupid the discussion was

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 12:29am EDT
Omg I wish I could've witnessed that

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 12:29am EDT

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 12:33am EDT

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 9:24pm EDT
what part was bad?

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 9:24pm EDT
Failed parallel parking and k turn even though I know how to k turn perfectly. And the guy was kind of a jerk aside from that

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 9:25pm EDT
Apparently "ran" or "rolled through" or whatever 2 of 3 stop signs but that's bullshit bc I stopped at each one of them, just not to his liking

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 9:25pm EDT
don't worry, hopefully he'll get in a car accident because he gets a really terrible driver one day. he won't die but he'll pay a million in medical expnses :D

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 9:26pm EDT
Haha that's the best response to this news I've heard all day

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 9:27pm EDT
i try

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 9:28pm EDT
i know a lot more directors than i thought i did

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 9:29pm EDT
You succeed. And that's wonderful!

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 9:30pm EDT
so what are your plans now that you don't have a lisence

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 9:30pm EDT
mine is learning how to spell liscence

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 9:31pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 9:31pm EDT
Then take it again

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 9:32pm EDT
And hopefully pass

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 9:32pm EDT
Or cry and kill myself for failing twice

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 9:32pm EDT
i'm thinking you should avoid the latter

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 9:32pm EDT
Yaknow

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 9:33pm EDT
you should never cry before killing yourself

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 9:33pm EDT
shows weakness

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 9:34pm EDT
Lmfao

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 9:50pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 9:50pm EDT
How do you spell centre and theatre?

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
those are just when i feel like being a dick though

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT
Hahah of course

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT
i hate having to go through and check for all those whenever i write stuff in english

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 9:57pm EDT
even though its technically correct *english* spelling

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT
as opposed to american

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT
I had to stop spelling like that in my English essays

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 10:06pm EDT
do they actually correct it? i'm gonna test that next year, just use entirely british spelling and see what happens

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 10:06pm EDT
Well you might be able to get away with it depending. Mr Burke was explaining to me why I wasn't supposed to do that but idr why

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 10:07pm EDT
she tried correcting my spelling of naivete so i gave her a list of like 10 alternate spelling that still count

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 10:09pm EDT
Mrs Burke I'm assuming? Haha oh boy

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 10:10pm EDT
she was just like 'oh...okay'

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 10:13pm EDT
XD

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 10:15pm EDT
i was expecting a bit more, she also didn't correct me anymore after that

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 10:15pm EDT
i was kinda disapponited, i like telling teachers they're wrong

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 10:24pm EDT
I believe it

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 10:25pm EDT
mary went to a god damn special effects makeup class for sail, i am annoyed

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 10:25pm EDT
i want to do that

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
:(

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
I'm sorry ): . Well I'm only doing sail for like one week so

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
my total days were less than a week if that makes you feel better

Nick Devlin August 2, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
and i was scheduled for two weeks

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
Eh lol

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 2, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 3, 2011 at 1:05am EDT
I will not include a self-destruct mechanism unless absolutely necessary. If it is necessary, it will not be a large red button labelled "Danger: Do Not Push". The big red button marked "Do Not Push" will instead trigger a spray of bullets on anyone stupid enough to disregard it. Similarly, the ON/OFF switch will not clearly be labelled as such.

Nick Devlin August 3, 2011 at 1:06am EDT
love that one

Nick Devlin August 3, 2011 at 1:06am EDT
All bumbling conjurers, clumsy squires, no-talent bards, and cowardly thieves in the land will be preemptively put to death. My foes will surely give up and abandon their quest if they have no source of comic relief.

Nick Devlin August 3, 2011 at 1:06am EDT

Steph Dudak August 3, 2011 at 1:08am EDT

Nick Devlin August 3, 2011 at 1:12am EDT
hhahaha, I totally should, and I'll make sure not to tell anyone where its from, and to adjust the words so they can't google it

Nick Devlin August 3, 2011 at 1:12am EDT
If I'm wearing the key to the hero's shackles around my neck and his former girlfriend now volunteers to become my mistress and we are all alone in my bedchamber on my bed and she offers me a goblet of wine, I will politely decline the offer.

Nick Devlin August 3, 2011 at 1:12am EDT

Nick Devlin August 3, 2011 at 1:21am EDT

Steph Dudak August 3, 2011 at 1:22am EDT

Steph Dudak August 3, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
You gotta get one then

Nick Devlin August 3, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
they're just so hard to find nowadays

Steph Dudak August 3, 2011 at 11:30pm EDT
Yeah and it's hard to find people that can make em too

Steph Dudak August 3, 2011 at 11:31pm EDT
You go to a store and ask for some plate boots and they look at you like you have two heads and some tentacles.

Nick Devlin August 3, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
and then when you ask about the emerald and jade engraving

Nick Devlin August 3, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
they just stop listening

Steph Dudak August 3, 2011 at 11:34pm EDT
Ugh I know! It's ridiculous. And never mind trying to find a quality sword.

Nick Devlin August 3, 2011 at 11:34pm EDT
i mean is it so difficult to sell swords that won't break when used to hack off limbs?

Steph Dudak August 3, 2011 at 11:37pm EDT
Right? Oh what can you do. I should pick up blacksmithing

Nick Devlin August 3, 2011 at 11:39pm EDT
you totally should

Nick Devlin August 3, 2011 at 11:40pm EDT
i'd buy your stuff, i wonder where you'd go to learn that

Steph Dudak August 3, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
Somewhere high in the mountains, in a hidden temple where an old, wise warrior resides

Steph Dudak August 3, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
Guarded by a dragon, which you need to pass without killing

Nick Devlin August 3, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
that's one plave

Nick Devlin August 3, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
good, i lyke dragons

Steph Dudak August 3, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
And you may only entre the temple if you are worthy enough.

Steph Dudak August 3, 2011 at 11:43pm EDT
Actually, you may pass the dragon if you're worthy enough. That's the first step.

Nick Devlin August 3, 2011 at 11:43pm EDT
man medieval times must have sucked, if you had to do all that just to get a job

Steph Dudak August 3, 2011 at 11:45pm EDT
Well that's nowadays

Steph Dudak August 3, 2011 at 11:45pm EDT
Not just anyone can be a blacksmith cause theyve all died out obvi

Steph Dudak August 3, 2011 at 11:46pm EDT
One of the few left has to be heavily protected of course.

Nick Devlin August 3, 2011 at 11:46pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 3, 2011 at 11:46pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 4, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 4, 2011 at 11:49pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 4, 2011 at 11:49pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 4, 2011 at 11:50pm EDT

Schrodinger's cat walks into a bar

Nick Devlin August 4, 2011 at 11:57pm EDT
and doesn't

Nick Devlin August 4, 2011 at 11:58pm EDT
:D

Steph Dudak August 4, 2011 at 11:59pm EDT
got me there lol

Nick Devlin August 5, 2011 at 12:00am EDT
Schrodinger's cat is the explanation used to describe how elemental particles are affected by someone watching them, until they are viewed, the particle is both possible outcomes simultaneously

Nick Devlin August 5, 2011 at 12:01am EDT
so if a cat was in a box with a poisonous gas that would be released if a random event occured, then the cat would be both dead and alive untl someone opened the box to see if the gas was released or not

Steph Dudak August 5, 2011 at 12:03am EDT
ahh i gotcha

Nick Devlin August 5, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
i suppose i could have made the joke better by saying Schrodinger's cat walks into a bar *when no one's looking* and doesn't

Nick Devlin August 5, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
that would have made it better I think

Nick Devlin August 5, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
oh well

Steph Dudak August 5, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
yeah probably lol at least you know for next time

Nick Devlin August 5, 2011 at 12:25am EDT

Nick Devlin August 5, 2011 at 12:25am EDT

Steph Dudak August 5, 2011 at 12:27am EDT
youre giving mods a tour?

Steph Dudak August 5, 2011 at 12:27am EDT
why?

Nick Devlin August 5, 2011 at 12:27am EDT
they don't come on very often anymore

Nick Devlin August 5, 2011 at 12:27am EDT
this is just a temp map

Nick Devlin August 5, 2011 at 12:28am EDT
so no one really does much on server until we get a permanent one

Nick Devlin August 5, 2011 at 12:28am EDT

There's a section that says "Ask". Check off the box that says "Let people ask questions". And if you want, also check off "Allow anonymous questions" or whatever. And your askbox link will be motivatedsloth.tumblr.com/ask automatically.

Steph Dudak August 17, 2011 at 12:21am EDT
You can have a living room with a small bookcase. But the bookcase is a door that leads to a super cool library and the walls are just giant bookcases

Steph Dudak August 17, 2011 at 12:21am EDT
And there'll be a fire place and shit

Nick Devlin August 20, 2011 at 4:39pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 20, 2011 at 4:40pm EDT
Well

Steph Dudak August 20, 2011 at 4:40pm EDT
Hold on

Nick Devlin August 20, 2011 at 4:42pm EDT
holding

Steph Dudak August 20, 2011 at 4:43pm EDT
No actually that's pretty much it lol. Title, author, setting (time, place, socio-economics, significant historical events), major characters, minor characters, plot summary (just hit the highlights which will help you recall needed aspects). And central conflict - internal or external

Steph Dudak August 20, 2011 at 4:43pm EDT
Then in sept we need to be prepared to do like. A cull analysis o. Em or somethin

Nick Devlin August 20, 2011 at 4:43pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 20, 2011 at 4:44pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 20, 2011 at 4:46pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 20, 2011 at 4:47pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 20, 2011 at 4:47pm EDT
But idk lol

Nick Devlin August 20, 2011 at 4:48pm EDT
well I didn't see much else cool on that list

Steph Dudak August 20, 2011 at 4:49pm EDT
There wasn't anything >.<

Nick Devlin August 20, 2011 at 4:57pm EDT
damn it tumblr

Nick Devlin August 20, 2011 at 4:58pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 20, 2011 at 4:58pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 20, 2011 at 5:03pm EDT
Story of my life

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 10:40pm EDT
I am critiquing klems new song

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT
yeah there's like a million questions. i'm being occupied. how's that goin?

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
i told him about a couple jarring notes, said the violin sounded a bit off and that the end was amazing.

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 10:44pm EDT
welll that is just wonderful

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 10:45pm EDT
i thought so

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
I noticed you jacked my 30 day challenge

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
i did! lol

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
i wanted to do another one, but i felt like doing a second WoW 30 day challenge would be a little much

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
and it seemed interesting enough

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
I gave up on finishing my anime one

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
XD

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
some of those are interesting

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
I just don't feel like researching each question, so I don't mess up names and whatnot. I have like 3 Fairy Tail based tumblrs following me -_-

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT
oh goodness .-.

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
i don't even know where half my followers come from. idk why i have followers really lol. all my tumblr is, is the reblogging of WoW related things, kittens, and architecture. and then random things i find funny.

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
replace WoW with pokemon and you got my tumblr

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
i think a lot are just follow me i follow you type of things

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
yeah i definitely have a bunch of those.

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
that's kinda lame though lol

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
how many followers you even got?

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
have*

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
no clue why that even bothered me

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
hahaha. i have 83

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
damn

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
out of that, are a couple people i knew online before tumblr (so thats why theyre following me/i'm following them)

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
then theres you, kristyn, laurie, ian, steffanie weiss, and julia...

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
julia?

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
esposito

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
oh.

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
haha that girl hates me

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
i used to be best friends with her in 7th grade lol

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
then a good portion are people that play WoW, and some other random people

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 10:58pm EDT
almost 1/3 of my followers actually know me.

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 10:58pm EDT
damn band camp

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 10:58pm EDT
i prefer people that don't know me

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 10:58pm EDT
just because when people know you, it's like.

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 10:58pm EDT
idk. i feel like i need to watch what i say you know?

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 10:58pm EDT
Yeah I know

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
But it depends on the people

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
oh well yeah

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
certain people idc

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
but then there's others that it's like.. whhhhy

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
i don't have any people like that :D

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
Mostly because they all have much worse problems then I do and nothing I say could really be that embarrassing

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
like half of the kids in band have depression I think

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
i wouldn't doubt it o.o

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
that's also kind of scary, and quite depressing as well

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
I know!

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:02pm EDT
And now I gotta comment on all their depressing status updates, making bad jokes!

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:02pm EDT
I'm just too nice

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:04pm EDT
>.<

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:04pm EDT
well you don't HAVE to XD. but it is good to try to make people feel better about themselves

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:04pm EDT
the only issue with that though, is that they don't care and are like WAH I SUCK I'M WORTHLESS WAH HATE MY LIFE RAWR

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:04pm EDT
and then i'm like.

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:04pm EDT
._.

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:05pm EDT
after giving them like a 5 minute speech about how awesome and not worthless they are. and theyre like. yeah. BUT I SUCK

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:05pm EDT
pretty much that

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:05pm EDT
i gave up that route I think

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
I just self reference the situation the bring up a random topic to distract them now. Hopefully just having a normal discussion can make them forget about depressing shit

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
yeah that's true

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:07pm EDT
but what's worse is when they bring it up first. it's like oh, hello to you too. my day was fine, thanks. how was yours?

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:07pm EDT
yep thats one of the annoying ones

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:08pm EDT
I aso dislike the trying to hide it, but its soo obvious you want attention one

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:08pm EDT
its worse when they actually do have a problem as well

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:10pm EDT
Ugh yes! Exactlyyy. I just can't handle it sometimes

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:10pm EDT
Remember ashley in chem?

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
Most antisocial person ever. And she posted that she will not talk to anyone tomorrow

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
Yess

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:12pm EDT
so I must now make it my job to talk to her all day about random stuff

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:12pm EDT
I'm thinking My Little Pony will be a big part of it

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:13pm EDT
Oh goodness

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:13pm EDT
Good luck. But don't shove MLP down her throat lol

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:13pm EDT
I'll just keep referencing in most likely

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
like you remind me of Twilight Sparkle when Princess Celestia first sent her to Ponyville.

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
How exactly? Haha

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
Ahh

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:16pm EDT
Yes ._.

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:16pm EDT
I will type slower

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT
Thanks XD. Facebook is awful on my iPod like I can't. I have to reply in the actual messages section bc sometimes in chat it doesn't send everything so

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
I got a facebook messenger app that works a bit better but is still finniky

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
The tumblr app can be kinda lame too sometimes. Like when I'm scrolling through a few hrs worth of posts on my dash and it crashes lol.

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
the tumblr app sucks, I can't see pictures after a hundred or so images, the won't load, and I can't refresh to that point in the list of pics.

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
Seriously? That's lame .-.

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
I need a wider vocabulary

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
I never use it

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
Or a nap

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
I just used "lame" quite a few tines

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
thesaurus app on my ipod works fine though

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
Times *

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
i use awesome all the tine

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:26pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
I didn't make it XD I just filled it out

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
It kept me busy for a bit

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
with music

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
Some answers are entertaining

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
you picked the songs yeah?

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
Nope they were on shuffle

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
so its just random

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:30pm EDT
Sing plays, put it down for an answer. Press next and repeat

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:30pm EDT
Song*

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:30pm EDT
yeppp

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:31pm EDT
i'm less impressed, but still thats a lot of songs to type, I would have given up at like 20

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
Well thats what makes it entertaining

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
Having em on shuffle

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
I know you can turn autocorrect off though

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:46pm EDT
Yeah but then everything would just be terrible

Steph Dudak August 22, 2011 at 11:46pm EDT
I like auto correct when it correctly corrects stuff

Nick Devlin August 22, 2011 at 11:47pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 23, 2011 at 12:21am EDT

Crater?!

Nick Devlin August 23, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
Space Volcano?!

Steph Dudak August 23, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
That'd be cool

Steph Dudak August 23, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
But no

Nick Devlin August 23, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
:(

Steph Dudak August 23, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
It's just a pathway and trees in Cattus Island

Nick Devlin August 23, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
oh a real place, thats cool

Nick Devlin August 23, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
what medium?

Steph Dudak August 23, 2011 at 12:23am EDT
Acryllic paint

Nick Devlin August 23, 2011 at 12:24am EDT
thats sorta fun

Steph Dudak August 23, 2011 at 12:24am EDT
Kinda. It doesn't look very good right now but it's gettin there lol

Steph Dudak August 23, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
Still gotta add all the leaves to the trees and stuff

Steph Dudak August 23, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
Do the grass

Steph Dudak August 23, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
Etc

Nick Devlin August 23, 2011 at 12:26am EDT
ugg leaves i can't do anything with leaves. I usually just make it winter.

Nick Devlin August 23, 2011 at 12:26am EDT
but it sounds amusing, better than like a glass of water

Steph Dudak August 23, 2011 at 12:27am EDT
Definitely. And it's fun when you're right there painting it. Rather than doing it from a picture or something.

Nick Devlin August 23, 2011 at 12:28am EDT
seems like it would be.

Steph Dudak August 23, 2011 at 12:30am EDT
It is. And it was nice out today so it was good

Nick Devlin August 23, 2011 at 12:30am EDT
Well I imagine doing it in the rain would be difficult, so glad it was nice out

Steph Dudak August 23, 2011 at 12:32am EDT
Unless I sat in a chair under a really big unbrella

Steph Dudak August 23, 2011 at 12:32am EDT
Umbrella*

Nick Devlin August 23, 2011 at 12:33am EDT
or you could like build a shack with a giant glass wall

Maybe its a sign to lay off WoW for a while

Steph Dudak August 24, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
it's not lol. it's not crucial to gameplay at all

Steph Dudak August 24, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
all it is

Steph Dudak August 24, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT
is the clock, (which when you click then opens the calendar), friends online, guild members online, fps latency, etc

Steph Dudak August 24, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 24, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 24, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
still though i think you play WoW more than I do minecraft stuff

Nick Devlin August 24, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 25, 2011 at 12:19am EDT

Steph Dudak August 25, 2011 at 12:19am EDT
i was looking at this one the other day

Steph Dudak August 25, 2011 at 12:19am EDT
maybe a few days ago

Steph Dudak August 25, 2011 at 12:19am EDT
but there was nothing normal on it.

Steph Dudak August 25, 2011 at 12:19am EDT
it was all like

Steph Dudak August 25, 2011 at 12:19am EDT
LOVE JESUS. JESUS AND GOD AND LOVE AND JESUS

Steph Dudak August 25, 2011 at 12:19am EDT
but i noticed they'd like a bunch of random posts of mine

Steph Dudak August 25, 2011 at 12:20am EDT
yeah if you go back more, you'll see more junk like that

Steph Dudak August 25, 2011 at 12:20am EDT
but it made me wonder why they're following me

Nick Devlin August 25, 2011 at 12:20am EDT
well they have enough normal stuff

Nick Devlin August 25, 2011 at 12:21am EDT
maybe they just like kittens

Steph Dudak August 25, 2011 at 12:21am EDT
well i'd hope so

Steph Dudak August 25, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
cause that'd be silly

Nick Devlin August 25, 2011 at 12:23am EDT
the only thing religion realted (not mocking it) is reblogged by the only guy who post pornographic images

Nick Devlin August 25, 2011 at 12:23am EDT
on my dashboard

Nick Devlin August 25, 2011 at 12:23am EDT
its weird as hell

Steph Dudak August 25, 2011 at 12:23am EDT

Nick Devlin August 25, 2011 at 12:24am EDT
i have maybe 10 people following me that i don't follow

Steph Dudak August 25, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
i only follow back if i like the blog... oooor if i know the people personally cause then i just feel bad

Nick Devlin August 25, 2011 at 12:26am EDT
usually i check out the website and if the theme isn't complete shit then i check out images.

Steph Dudak August 25, 2011 at 12:26am EDT
well i don't judge entirely on theme

Steph Dudak August 25, 2011 at 12:27am EDT
like this one person i'm following, their background on their theme gives me seizures

Steph Dudak August 25, 2011 at 12:27am EDT
but he's awesome so it's okay. not to mention i'm never really actually on that page so

Nick Devlin August 25, 2011 at 12:28am EDT
i'm very judgemental. Most people i follow is usually from a source image or something so i don't need to check out a them

Nick Devlin August 25, 2011 at 12:28am EDT
theme*

Nick Devlin August 25, 2011 at 12:28am EDT

Steph Dudak August 26, 2011 at 2:50pm EDT
well actually theyre kinda catchy. but i wouldn't like listen to em on a daily basis

Steph Dudak August 26, 2011 at 2:51pm EDT
i'd sing along if i heard it though. those kinda songs

Nick Devlin August 26, 2011 at 2:52pm EDT
The beat/ tune/ whatever are cool. But they're on the radio songs I'd listen to list, not the download on ipod list

Steph Dudak August 26, 2011 at 2:53pm EDT

105.7 isn't bad either

Steph Dudak August 26, 2011 at 2:55pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 26, 2011 at 2:55pm EDT
it's not my first choice

Nick Devlin August 26, 2011 at 2:56pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 26, 2011 at 2:56pm EDT
its like as bad as manslaughter

Steph Dudak August 26, 2011 at 2:56pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 26, 2011 at 2:58pm EDT
lol *

Steph Dudak August 26, 2011 at 2:58pm EDT
why

Nick Devlin August 26, 2011 at 2:58pm EDT
mostly just to see how person will react.

Nick Devlin August 26, 2011 at 2:58pm EDT
and cause they have like no commercials

Nick Devlin August 26, 2011 at 2:59pm EDT
well the spanish ones do, but they sound so freaking happy to be alive that it doesn't even sound like a commercial

Steph Dudak August 26, 2011 at 2:59pm EDT
omg spanish commercials are ridiculous

Steph Dudak August 26, 2011 at 2:59pm EDT
ALL OF THEM are so happy and like

Steph Dudak August 26, 2011 at 3:00pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 26, 2011 at 3:00pm EDT
I know!!

Steph Dudak August 26, 2011 at 3:00pm EDT
if you're watchin em on tv, half the time idk what theyre advertising though

Steph Dudak August 26, 2011 at 3:01pm EDT
like i was going through channels once and stopped on a spanish channel and they were talking so fast but they were all like YEAH SPANISH IMMAPSEAKAMILLIONMILESAMINUTE. and i was like wtf is this. turned out to be a condom commercial. but not like a trojan commercial or anything. and the only reason i figured it out was because of some cognates and yeah. trying to watch spanish television isn't good though since i can never even slightly understand

Steph Dudak August 26, 2011 at 3:01pm EDT
like those spanish talk shows and stuff

Steph Dudak August 26, 2011 at 3:01pm EDT
oh man

Nick Devlin August 26, 2011 at 3:02pm EDT
yep, people always says its just becaue you don't understand the language

Nick Devlin August 26, 2011 at 3:02pm EDT
they're lying

Nick Devlin August 26, 2011 at 3:02pm EDT
i hear people that actually speak spanish talk

Nick Devlin August 26, 2011 at 3:02pm EDT
they talk normally

Steph Dudak August 26, 2011 at 3:02pm EDT
some of them talk fast though. not as fast as tv

Steph Dudak August 26, 2011 at 3:02pm EDT
but fast enough

Nick Devlin August 26, 2011 at 3:02pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 26, 2011 at 3:13pm EDT
i don't even subscribe to enough people on youtube to watch that many

Nick Devlin August 26, 2011 at 3:13pm EDT
exactly it doesn't help when some videos are just people listing other videos I should watch, which like exponentially increases the damn chani

Steph Dudak August 26, 2011 at 3:15pm EDT
lately i've only been bothering to watch very few things. i recently picked up on http://youtu.be/NOmoWVbhWiU this. i don't even have plans to play this game, but i enjoy watching this guy play *insert any of the thousand games he plays* because it's quite amusing

Steph Dudak August 26, 2011 at 3:37pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 26, 2011 at 3:37pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 27, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT
most of the time

Steph Dudak August 27, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT
zuko, sokka, and toph are my favourites

Nick Devlin August 27, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
yeah i think katara is meant to be a bit annoying, aang i don't mind

Nick Devlin August 27, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
toph is amazing

Nick Devlin August 27, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
sokka is hilarious

Nick Devlin August 27, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
zuko just kept getting better

Nick Devlin August 27, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
and iroh was probably best

Steph Dudak August 27, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
OMG

Steph Dudak August 27, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 27, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 27, 2011 at 9:42pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 27, 2011 at 9:45pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 27, 2011 at 9:46pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 27, 2011 at 9:46pm EDT
duck turtles and rabbaroos and whatnot

Steph Dudak August 27, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 27, 2011 at 9:57pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 27, 2011 at 9:57pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 27, 2011 at 10:15pm EDT
i cant judge much by thqat slide show since none of them are in character but i doubt any are very good compared to costuming i've seen so far

Steph Dudak August 27, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 28, 2011 at 7:51pm EDT
before I even handed paper in

Steph Dudak August 28, 2011 at 7:52pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 28, 2011 at 7:52pm EDT
in any way

Steph Dudak August 28, 2011 at 7:53pm EDT
And

Steph Dudak August 28, 2011 at 7:53pm EDT
It's really just the no final thing. But I mean. Idk

Nick Devlin August 28, 2011 at 7:53pm EDT
is it worth a year in a class you hate?

Steph Dudak August 28, 2011 at 7:53pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 28, 2011 at 7:54pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 28, 2011 at 7:54pm EDT
Well that's the thing idk if I'll hate it

Nick Devlin August 28, 2011 at 8:08pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 28, 2011 at 8:08pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 28, 2011 at 8:12pm EDT
Haha omg right.

Steph Dudak August 28, 2011 at 8:12pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 12:39am EDT
the assignments are pretty specific

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 12:39am EDT
hold on im gonna try to send you it

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 12:40am EDT
	Complete a work that features a subject in a dramatic light. The subject should be in a context and design elements and composition should be considered. 	Create an artwork that is in service of a ritual of that has personal significance. This artwork can be based on a ritual that is overtly or covertly significant. Clipping toenails may be as significant to some as the marriage is to others. It is your task to establish this significance. Explore all aspects suggested by the word RITUAL (e.g. routine, time, chronology, spiritual, etc.). These elements should be evident in the work if it is to truly read as a significant ritual. There are no material restrictions; students should choose a material and scale that best brings the viewer to their ritual.

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 12:40am EDT
	Enlarge and magnify a metallic object: Zero in on a section of metallic objects, such as a close-up of part of a bike or motorcycle, or forks and spoons. Make use of hardedge metal reflections and cast shadows. 	Do a self-portrait that expresses a specific mood. Think about the effects of color and how its use can help convey the individual mood. You might want to do several studies, reflecting different moods. 	Combine a manufactured object and a natural object (ex. an apple and a thumb tack). Show how the newly created object is useful or useless. Use any choice of media.

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 12:40am EDT
	Render or model (using wire, wood or clay) a figure group in their environment. 	Design or fashion a mask from your own cultural background. 	Make three objects whose forms are related but different from each other. 	Large Landscape: minimum size 18 x 24. The landscape must show depth and distance. The landscape can be done from any angle. Overlapping and repetition helps to create a sense of depth and distance. Emphasize dark and light shapes, textures, and space. Create strong contrasts and do not use outlines in nature! The landscape must be done in color in any choice of media including paint, collage or mixed media. The landscape must be done on a flat, smooth, 2-dimensional surface. All landscapes must have a foreground, middle ground and background. Lighting is very important and should be dramatic.

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 12:40am EDT
	Masterpieces re-visited, reworked and given a distinctly 60s flair. Try a mixed media technique and be creative. Research the style of the 1960s, the clothes, the culture, the music, etc. 	Find and research two artists whose work you find interesting. In your journal or sketchbook, describe their media and techniques and the problem they explore in their work.

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 12:40am EDT
and i need to do three outta this list

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 12:43am EDT
That actually looks fun. I like the non 2-d stuff a lot

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 12:43am EDT
But of course you pick the project with the longest description

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 12:43am EDT
lmao

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 12:44am EDT
idk what others to do!

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 12:44am EDT

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 12:44am EDT
annd self portrait without showing likeness

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 12:47am EDT
They sound cool. You should totally do the plastic wrapped bananas for the manufactured/ nature one.

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 12:49am EDT
And make your mood for the self portrait as like victorious. Like you slaying a dragon or getting an A on some test

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 12:51am EDT
dkhhrsl that'd be awesome lol. both of those XD

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 12:51am EDT
plastic wrapped banana aaah

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 12:54am EDT
I can do ideas, just not the transfer into reality.

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 12:54am EDT
Which is pretty much definition of art I think

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 12:55am EDT
basically haha. if you could just apply those ideas you'd be unstoppable. then again, you can do that in plenty of ways

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 1:02am EDT
Such as? Finger paint :D??

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 1:06am EDT
No wait! Macaroni art!!

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 1:07am EDT
Or maybe pipe cleaners could be utilized

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 1:07am EDT
YES

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 1:07am EDT
all of it

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 1:10am EDT
I'll do it while procrastinating my homework tomorrow

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 1:11am EDT
i expect to see the outcome

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 1:12am EDT
Well now that it is assigned it might take a few weeks longer but I'll do it eventually

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 1:17am EDT
Once I locate paint and macaroni and pipe cleaners

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 1:22am EDT
you can get those anywhere psht

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 1:23am EDT
Except my house. We probly had them like stockpiled until I decided that I wanted to use them tonight

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 1:24am EDT
Once I look for them tomorrow I'll discover a thief has stolen those 3 things and the glue but left everything else untouched

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 1:28am EDT
Yep my iPod has 3 minutes left I'm guessing, and my eyes have like 1

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 1:29am EDT
Talk to ya later!

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 1:43am EDT
byee goodnight!

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 2:43pm EDT
so how much java do you know?

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 2:59pm EDT
I never really got into java /:

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 3:04pm EDT
yeah neither did i

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 3:07pm EDT
which is a bit of a problem

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 3:12pm EDT
What exactly is your assignment

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 3:13pm EDT
i have this worksheet

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 3:13pm EDT
its mostly filling in charts

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 3:13pm EDT
But I am still trying to figure out what all these words mean

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 3:17pm EDT
what words lol

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 3:18pm EDT
...

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 3:18pm EDT
let me copy the first paragraph

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 3:20pm EDT
alllrighty

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 3:22pm EDT
In chapter 1, we put all of our code in the main() method. That's not exactly object-oriented. In fact that's not object-oriented at all. Well we did use a few objects like the String arrays for the Phrase-o-matic, but we didn't actually develop any of our own object types. So now we've got to leave that procedural world behind, get the heck out of main(), and start makingsome objects of our own. We'll look at what makes object-oriented (OO) development so much fun. We''l look at the difference between and object and a class... Yeah that's all I'm writing

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 3:22pm EDT
I still didn't even finish writing the rest of the first paragraph

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 3:28pm EDT
oh my goodness

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 3:29pm EDT
whats eve worse is that guard practice started half an hour ago

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 3:29pm EDT
well i feel like all that is something you'd know if you took whatever class it is that you took lol

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 3:29pm EDT
i know right!

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 3:29pm EDT
are you not going then?

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 3:29pm EDT
how am supposed to know this stuff

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 3:29pm EDT
I'm running is what i'm doing

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 3:30pm EDT
talk to ya whenever i get back which might be never

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 3:30pm EDT
sara's gonna be pissd

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 3:30pm EDT
good luck!

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 3:30pm EDT
be careful, don't get yourself killed, etc

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 3:32pm EDT
i'll try

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 6:57pm EDT
i didn't die

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 6:57pm EDT
almost passed out

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 6:57pm EDT
but didnt die

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 7:07pm EDT
O.o

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 7:07pm EDT
At least you're alive!

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 7:07pm EDT
That's always good

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:07pm EDT
:D

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:07pm EDT
i know!

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 7:12pm EDT
This art thing is turning out to be real awful. I have 0 inspiration idk what I'm gonna do

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:12pm EDT
for which project?

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 7:13pm EDT
All of them

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:14pm EDT
-.-

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:14pm EDT
well the nature thing isn't that hard

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:15pm EDT
what can you thing of that is completely useless?

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 7:15pm EDT
I already did the landscape

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:15pm EDT
manufactured/ nature

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:15pm EDT
not the landscape

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 7:15pm EDT
Oh yeah well that's the thing

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
There's tons of things thatd be completely useless but I dont wanna just combine two random things

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 7:17pm EDT
Like oh here's an apple attached to a gold chain. It's a necklace that eventually rots away

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 7:17pm EDT
But then again that is basically what that is

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 7:17pm EDT
But I want to think of something not so lame

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:17pm EDT
i was thinking more along the lines of something people invented that is not necessary because it already esists in nature

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:18pm EDT
like bottled water

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:18pm EDT
cause, you know, we had water

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 7:19pm EDT
Yeah that exists though

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 7:20pm EDT
I can't just bring in or draw a bottle of water. The assignment is to combine two things yourself and show if it's useful or nit

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 7:20pm EDT
Not*

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:20pm EDT
yeah so draw a bunch of empty wter bottles clogging a stream

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:20pm EDT
bam

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:20pm EDT
done

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:22pm EDT
owait

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:22pm EDT
like real stuff?

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:22pm EDT
thats still doable

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:23pm EDT
but more difficult

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:24pm EDT
umm

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:25pm EDT
i completely misunderstood the assignment

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:26pm EDT
you have to combine two things in order to make a new item?

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:26pm EDT
I thought you were just contrating manufactured and natural things

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 7:26pm EDT
Combine a natural and manufactured object. The example was an apple and a thumbtack

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 7:26pm EDT
Basically

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:33pm EDT
so thats kinda stupid actually i dont like it as much

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:34pm EDT
blegh i can't even think of anything for that

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:35pm EDT
just do the drawing i said

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:35pm EDT
much better

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:38pm EDT
but yeah i can only think of stupid ideas for the maubfactured thing

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:42pm EDT
unless you allowed to make weapons

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:42pm EDT
in which case i can think of tons of iseas for some reason

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 7:45pm EDT
Well if said weapons include a natural stuff

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 7:46pm EDT
Like a sword covered in vines

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 7:46pm EDT
Or a gun that shoots out acorns

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:47pm EDT
kinda stuff like tahat, yeah

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:52pm EDT
but i dont think a weapon would go over too well

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 7:54pm EDT
Wellll

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 7:56pm EDT
Idk the fact that itd be rendered useless

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 7:56pm EDT
It'd only be drawn lol

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 7:56pm EDT
And if it's a useless weapon

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 7:56pm EDT
Then yaknow

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 7:56pm EDT
Orrrr yaknow

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:57pm EDT
ohhhh maybe you combine a weapon with something from nature in order to make it worthless

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:57pm EDT
have like a stop the violence message

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 7:57pm EDT
Like a sword with the blade made out of twigs and leaves. It's basically a giant stick with a hilt

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 7:57pm EDT
Yeah that too

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:58pm EDT
so either having an awesome weapon

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:59pm EDT
or having a useless weapon

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:59pm EDT
the awesome would probably be more fun to draw

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:59pm EDT
and you could just copy something from WoW probably, or at least the style

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 7:59pm EDT
and the useless might get more points for having a message or something

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:00pm EDT
omg ready

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:00pm EDT
there's this sword actually

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:00pm EDT
imma show you it

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:00pm EDT
funfun

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:01pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:02pm EDT
i think it looks pretty bad ass

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:02pm EDT
haha awesome

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:02pm EDT
whats natural about?

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:02pm EDT
besides that it is green

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:03pm EDT
theres nothing natural about it. it's a normal sword. but the thing would be combining something like that with something natural.

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:03pm EDT
a sword on fire o:

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:03pm EDT
hahaahah

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:03pm EDT
owait!!

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:04pm EDT
i just remembered something you will find amazing i think

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:04pm EDT
!!

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:06pm EDT
alright found the name

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:06pm EDT
now i just need to find the image

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:08pm EDT
okay so this is a sword that transforms into cherry blossoms from an anime i used to watch

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:08pm EDT
the show is really weird so just ignore anything but the part i tell you about

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:09pm EDT
lol okay

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:11pm EDT
blegh its so hard to find the image i want

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:14pm EDT
FOUND ONE

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:14pm EDT
:D

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:14pm EDT
Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:14pm EDT
his sword turns into thouasands of cherry blossom petals

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:15pm EDT
and there isn't much weird stuff in this video :D

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:16pm EDT
O.O

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:16pm EDT
that's so cool!

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:16pm EDT
i know!

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:17pm EDT
it might be a bit hard to draw though...

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:18pm EDT
i just thought it was awesome

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:18pm EDT
it is awesome asdjkhflh

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:18pm EDT
hmmm

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:18pm EDT
well i guess i've decided i'm going to be drawing a sword lol

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:18pm EDT
yay!

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:18pm EDT
at least that parts out of the way

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:19pm EDT
now comes the final decision to make it useless or not useless

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:19pm EDT
i guess i should make it useless

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:19pm EDT
just because if i did do some sort of flaming sword, i'd probably get a weird reaction

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:19pm EDT
hmm maybe a better idea would be to make it useful, but in a helpful way

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:19pm EDT
like making something bad work in a good way

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:19pm EDT
"so how is this useful?" 'you can kill your enemies faster. when slicing them apart with a sword isn't good enough, they'll be set on fire as well!' sooo

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:20pm EDT
no clue how you'd do that though

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:20pm EDT
YEAHH

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:20pm EDT
but how hm

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:20pm EDT
well wait

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:20pm EDT
i'm assuming this doesn't need to be realistic right. since it's combining a natural and manufactured item

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:21pm EDT
idk where i'm really going with that i guess i just wanted to point tha tout

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:21pm EDT
that out *

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
i'm trying to think of anything good

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
not just something

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
that a sword can do

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
but i can't

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
i don't think there's anyway to make it heal someone

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
O.O

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
maybe some way to make it build

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
ACTUALLY

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
well actually

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
??!

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
that's where the non-realistic nonsense comes in.

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:23pm EDT
so nevermind

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:23pm EDT
here we go, gonna nerd real quick

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:23pm EDT
funfun

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:23pm EDT
more funfun

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:23pm EDT
in WoW, i have a sword for my tanking spec. it has an enchant that on melee attacks, it has a chance to heal you

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:23pm EDT
and the enchant is all green and there's like leaves and stuff flowing from it

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:23pm EDT
its really awesome looking

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:23pm EDT
especially since the swords green

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:24pm EDT
but in a real world sense, leaves on a sword would not heal you when you start chopping away at something with it sooo

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:24pm EDT
yeah every time i think healing, it involves magic

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:24pm EDT
which isn't really nature

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:25pm EDT
exactly /:

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:25pm EDT
lol a sword with a bandage compartment

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:25pm EDT
hahaha

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:27pm EDT
actually...

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:27pm EDT
that show has a guy who has a healing sword

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:27pm EDT
if anyone touches it thir pain is drained away

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:27pm EDT
and the energy can be blasted at enemies

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:27pm EDT
but that is of no use either

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:27pm EDT
bleghhghg

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:28pm EDT
all right healing won't work

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:28pm EDT
unless i make a bandage compartment

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:28pm EDT
which is slightly lame

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:28pm EDT
BUT

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:28pm EDT
i will keep that one in the back of my mind if nothing else comes up

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:28pm EDT
oh wait

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:28pm EDT
no

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:28pm EDT
scratch that

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:29pm EDT
bandages are not natural.

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:29pm EDT
hm

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:30pm EDT
what else is good

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:31pm EDT
ohhh maybe you could make a sword that you can make art with

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:31pm EDT
like using smooshed berries at the tip

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:31pm EDT
or something random like that

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:31pm EDT
hehe smooshed

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:32pm EDT
or like carving wood

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:36pm EDT
meeh

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:36pm EDT
idk

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:37pm EDT
what else are good things?

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:37pm EDT
building?

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:37pm EDT
creating?

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:37pm EDT
generally yes

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:38pm EDT
how can you make a sword do those things?

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:39pm EDT
swords destroy those things

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:39pm EDT
yeah, thats why the whole making it do the opposite is awesome

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:42pm EDT
the only thing i can think of would be like a fallen tree or something, then it got hacked into a sculpture of some kind

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:43pm EDT
you'd just have a wooden statue with the sword sticking in it in a forest with a bucnh of wood shavings everywhere

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:43pm EDT
but that sounds difficult

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:43pm EDT
and your're not really combining them

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:43pm EDT
just using the sword with nature

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:43pm EDT
this is hard

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:45pm EDT
well i don't HAVE to do a sword of course

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:45pm EDT
5id just like to

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:45pm EDT
id*

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:45pm EDT
but the only thing i can think of

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:45pm EDT
is replacing the blade

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:46pm EDT
or setting it on fire or something. thats natural right? fire sure

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:46pm EDT
oh wait

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:46pm EDT
didn't it say to make it useful or useless?

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:46pm EDT
lighting it on fire would make it more useful

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:46pm EDT
to kill people i suppose

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:46pm EDT
but that's no good

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:46pm EDT
its still useful

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:47pm EDT
lol

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:47pm EDT
i mean it is art

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:47pm EDT
i think what i can do is do that one,

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:47pm EDT
bt then do a second one

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:47pm EDT
in case that's like "unacceptable"

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:47pm EDT
THAT'S IT.

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:47pm EDT
i don't think she'd bug on me. she shouldn't. i'm being creative

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:47pm EDT
andit's not like im making a model of the sword

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:48pm EDT
version one will be a sword with the blade on fire. version two will be a sword ACTUALLY. thats like. the blade will go from metal to a bunch of leaves and stuff

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:48pm EDT
so like

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:48pm EDT
well vines and twigs attaching to the metal part

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:48pm EDT
so if its used, i mean. you won't really be able to. it'll just be all bendy

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:51pm EDT
then you'd just make up some story about how nature could aid or hinder objects

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:51pm EDT
and your done

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
you could make a kind of reflection on the same page, vines on one side fire on the other

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
genius

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
omg

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
asjkgdhjg

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
that's such a good idea

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
now you have to like draw it, which is where i am of much less use

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
yeah but now i have all these ideas!

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
:D

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
you're wonderful lol omg this was so helpful

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:54pm EDT
you even got to draw a sword in the end

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:54pm EDT
happy to help

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:54pm EDT
:D

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:54pm EDT
and then i just gotta do a third project and i'm done o.o

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:55pm EDT
i was just wondering if i should remind you that you had another one

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:55pm EDT
but i didn't have to

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:55pm EDT
you picked the self potrait for that one right?

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
yeah. without showing likeness

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
i could do that

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
i was actually thinking about it

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
like i don't have to even be in it

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
so then i was thinking about stuff i like and whatnot yaknow

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
just draw a tree and say you're peaceful

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:57pm EDT
i actually thought of this whole setting to incorporate a buncha stuff. but idk if i wanna actually put in the effort lmao

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:57pm EDT
its

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 8:59pm EDT
what i thought up was. okay it's outside. and there's two cherry blossom trees at either end of the page. between these trees, theres a giant scree. the trees are holding it up. the screen is cause i like movies yaknow. and there's a chair, in front of the screen, toward the fron of the paper. okay. annd then on the screen could be something. idk what. but something. like. my living room. there's a bookcase in here cause i do like reading when i actually find a good book. and my computers in here which i'm on way too much, and there could be something on the computer screen and IDK. that just went through my head and like a radio on the ground next to the chair bc i like music. but i don't wanna really draw all that and in my head it actually looks kinda cheesy SOOO

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:00pm EDT
but yk what i mean? it could be this whole big thing if i wanted

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 9:00pm EDT
that words, maybe it would be better to have like your room and then cherry blossom outside the window? to give better detail the the things you like

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 9:01pm EDT
or have the contents of your room, but arranged ouutside in a cherry tree grove

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 9:01pm EDT
idk

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:01pm EDT
i could do that too

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
it sounds like one of the pictures i'd reblog off tumblr lol

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
with a bed hanging in the trees omg

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
that'd be cool though

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
have a drawing pinned to a tree or something. i have a lot of my art stuff and computer graphics stuff hanging

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
in my room

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 9:03pm EDT
haha all minbe is in a pile in some drawer somewhere

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 9:03pm EDT
but yeah, just imagine you room was the cherry tree

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 9:03pm EDT
rain does not exist in that world

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 9:04pm EDT
cherry trees

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 9:04pm EDT
not singular

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:04pm EDT
well that's the thing. it just needs to be representative of me basically. i like nice weather and i hate rain so lol

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 9:04pm EDT
there ya go

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:05pm EDT
now i just need to apply these ideas o.o

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 9:05pm EDT
what are you using to draw with?

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 9:07pm EDT
moar paint?

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:09pm EDT
noooo no moar paint

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:09pm EDT
i think the sword

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:09pm EDT
i'm gonna do in coloured pencils

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:09pm EDT
the self portrait.. maaaybe chalk pastels?

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:09pm EDT
i havent gotten to use them yet

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 9:09pm EDT
it seems like they'd be better suited the other way around

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 9:10pm EDT
like pastels don't allow much detail which isn't necessary for fire and leaves and junk

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:10pm EDT
ah but that's the thing

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:10pm EDT
trees are not my specialty

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:10pm EDT
and considering theyre cherry blossom trees

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:10pm EDT
that requires a bunch of shades of pink and stuff

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:10pm EDT
i mean maybe i could do it in coloured pencil

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:11pm EDT
but i definitely can't do the swords in chalk pastels

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:11pm EDT
they wouldn't look as good

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 9:11pm EDT
yeah i see what ya mean

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 9:11pm EDT
how big are these supposed to be?

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:12pm EDT
no specific size for these ones

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 9:13pm EDT
the self potrait might have to big in order to detail it so that like your computer is recognizeable, or maybe you are just way better at pastels than me

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 9:13pm EDT
cause my stuff is mainly just a blur

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:14pm EDT
i'll work something out with that lol

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:14pm EDT
i mean what do i use it for

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:14pm EDT
fb, wow, tumblr

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:14pm EDT
if anything i could do a tv with like a nintendo 64 and controllers hooked up to it. there's lots of ways i can go with it

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 9:18pm EDT
yeah that you can just change whenever you feel like

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 9:18pm EDT
aww you saw the sine tangent bill cosby pun

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 9:19pm EDT
i was totally gonna use that at some point

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:19pm EDT
hahaha

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:19pm EDT
that was so good

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:30pm EDT
I'm kinda excited to start this stuff! Just gotta write it all down so I dont forget or anything. Hopefully they come out good

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:31pm EDT
I feel like doing either one of these in just pencil would be boring hm

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 9:33pm EDT
definately not the swords

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 9:33pm EDT
i can imagine the room thing being in pencil, but it'd be a very different style i suppose

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT
The only thing is that it'd look so pretty in colour

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT
especially since you're doing cherry blossoms

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
which you know are mostly about color

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
I have an 11x14 paper to work with for these.

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
If I can make everything big enough. Chalk pastel would look okay for the room

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
yeah that sound huge, i couldnt imagine making a full scene the size of computer paper let alone that. so youll probly be fine

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:40pm EDT
Eh it's not that big. But big enough I think

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
i really have no clue, but i am sad now that i must switch to ipod

Steph Dudak August 31, 2011 at 9:48pm EDT
Oh life. Hate when I have to do that

Nick Devlin August 31, 2011 at 9:49pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 7:57pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 8:19pm EDT
i think it only allows me to text people i have listed

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 8:19pm EDT
let me add your number to it

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 8:20pm EDT
732-814-2175?

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 8:20pm EDT
Yrs

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 8:20pm EDT
Yes*

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 8:25pm EDT
Anything?!

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 8:41pm EDT
SO

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 8:44pm EDT
if you didn't reference anything, then it is awesome comparatively

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 8:44pm EDT
its just minor dtuff

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 8:44pm EDT
but the basic design is cool

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 8:44pm EDT
hard to tell without the blade though

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 8:44pm EDT
Wonderful

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 8:44pm EDT
Oh it's going to be fixed. Big time

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 8:45pm EDT
i'd really recomed getting some to at least basse the proportions off of

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 8:48pm EDT
Oh well yeah

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 8:48pm EDT
And like I said that was quick

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 8:50pm EDT
I told you a lot of things were off lol. I'm aware of the lack of proportion, etc

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
will the two swords have different designs like the hilt and everything or will just the fire and leaves on the blade be the only difference?

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
Good question

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
I wad thinking about them being two completely different swords

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
Maybe the one with leaves being a thinner, smaller one

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
To emphasize it's uselessness.

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 8:54pm EDT
Something you can wield with one hand

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 8:54pm EDT
Meanwhile having the other more of a two handed sword. It'd obviously be bigger. And on fire

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 8:54pm EDT
gotcha, more elegant design for the fire and clunky for the plants

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 8:55pm EDT
opposite of what i said*

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
Yes

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 8:59pm EDT
Exactly

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 9:00pm EDT
awesome

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 9:00pm EDT
i am sweating

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 9:00pm EDT
dont eat 4 bowls of hot chicken soup

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 9:00pm EDT
when its like 90 degrees in your house

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 9:00pm EDT
just some advice

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 9:04pm EDT
Four bowls

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 9:04pm EDT
Do you have your windows open?

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 9:04pm EDT
It's awfully nice outside

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 9:05pm EDT
No my wiondows is closed, and I'm too lazy to go and open one

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 9:05pm EDT
but not too lazy to get a 5th bowl

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 9:06pm EDT
i'm so fat

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 9:11pm EDT
Lmfao

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 9:11pm EDT
You're not fat tho.

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 9:11pm EDT
Go open a window while you're up

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 9:11pm EDT
Kill two birds with one stone

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 9:13pm EDT
of course i'm fat i must weigh at least like 120, you know in europe being like 20 stone is morbidly obese?

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 9:13pm EDT
what does that make me?!

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 9:14pm EDT
120 is not that much lol

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 9:15pm EDT
hm i think i'd actually weigh clser to 10 stone

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 9:15pm EDT
maybe less

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 9:16pm EDT
i don't actually know how much I weigh...

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 9:16pm EDT
if i did though

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 9:16pm EDT
i could calculate more accurately

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 9:16pm EDT
anyway

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 9:16pm EDT
enough of my struggles with obesity

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 9:16pm EDT
the window problema is fixed

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 9:17pm EDT
Or lack thereof

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 9:17pm EDT
That's good!

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 9:21pm EDT
I KNOW!

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 9:21pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 9:32pm EDT
OMG.

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 9:32pm EDT
your welcome

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
That's awesome

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
And hilarious

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 9:40pm EDT
i thought so, but I can't get the image to get onto tumblr and still be legible

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 9:45pm EDT
thaaat's lame .-.

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 9:45pm EDT
i still am completely unable to post pictures on tumblr that have nice quality, even I have them downloaded

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 9:46pm EDT
I will look through options tomorrow and see if I can fix

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 9:46pm EDT
This NEEDS to be on tumblr and I can't find it on there already

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 9:50pm EDT
hm

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT
are you using the post photo option?

Steph Dudak September 1, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT
i mean if it comes out tiny usually it can just be clicked to make it bigger..

Nick Devlin September 1, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
yeah i pick the photo option, I think i messed with stuff in my preferences

Nick Devlin September 2, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
How are the swords coming al

Nick Devlin September 2, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
ong?

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
omg

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
i'm only gonna be doing one

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
but i'm doing it tomorrow when i'm at my dads friends house

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
ACTUALLY I HAVE A PIC

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
of what i hav e so far

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
lemme show you hold on

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
hold on. this'll take a min

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
or 5

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
i realize this is an hour late response. idk if you're even on right now but no matter

Nick Devlin September 2, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
Awake I am

Nick Devlin September 2, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
Not to worry

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
http://i53.tinypic.com/vsdxj5.png

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
click click click. i need to find out how to like

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
uh, make the blade outta leaves and stuff and make it look good. but i might make the hilt like that

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
OH AND

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
i need to draw this on an 18x24 piece of paper

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
bc the minimum size is 16x20 i think it is

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
but i dont have that size

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
womp

Nick Devlin September 2, 2011 at 11:26pm EDT
That sucks

Nick Devlin September 2, 2011 at 11:26pm EDT
How complete is that sketch? Like want criticism or praise at this stage?

Nick Devlin September 2, 2011 at 11:30pm EDT
At a certain point saying little things that need to adjusted isn't much help if you like colouring it tomorrow morning

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
It's not on the final page yet

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
Criticism is welcome

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
That's just me practicing

Nick Devlin September 2, 2011 at 11:34pm EDT
Do you want the swords symmetrical? I know this is just a sketch but I was just wondering

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:34pm EDT
I'm only doing one

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:35pm EDT
But that's kinda the plan

Nick Devlin September 2, 2011 at 11:37pm EDT
No like the sword itself is symmetrical like left and right side

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:39pm EDT
Yeah

Nick Devlin September 2, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
Alright I just wanted to know. Not sure why. But any way it's just minor things that are because of sketching reasons like lines touching and blablabla. But I do think some of the little designs on the hilt could be improved to flow better

Nick Devlin September 2, 2011 at 11:48pm EDT
I really wish I could just copy onto paint and show line changes

Nick Devlin September 2, 2011 at 11:48pm EDT
Damn ipod

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:48pm EDT
Asdjlmfsvj

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:49pm EDT
It's also not detailed or anything as I'd like it to be. But like I said. I didn't even expect to like this one the slightest bit lol. I feel the detail on the hilt should kinda go with the whole nature theme tho

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:50pm EDT
The little diamond shapes might be green

Nick Devlin September 2, 2011 at 11:50pm EDT
I will see how ling until I can kick my sister off the computer, she's stopped listening to my threats lately

Nick Devlin September 2, 2011 at 11:50pm EDT
Its annoying

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:51pm EDT
Things I hate about having to use a shared computer

Nick Devlin September 2, 2011 at 11:51pm EDT
But yeah I think giving the sword a nature theme is good

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:51pm EDT
My siblings are douchebags and I'm only allowed on for an hour at a time unless they're not around or it's late

Nick Devlin September 2, 2011 at 11:52pm EDT
Hehe, I'm the douchebag sibling at my house.

Nick Devlin September 2, 2011 at 11:53pm EDT
But sadly those fun times are changing one sister has grown a backbone and the other has moved

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:57pm EDT
I can't be the douchebag bc they annoy me til I get off

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:59pm EDT
Hardcore annoy me lol

Nick Devlin September 2, 2011 at 11:59pm EDT
Yep that's pretty much what I do

Nick Devlin September 2, 2011 at 11:59pm EDT
I read fox in socks to her this afternoon until she got angry and went away

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:59pm EDT
See but if I did that I'd be a hypocrite and then when I'm on they'd be like BUT YOU DO THIS TO ME SK

Steph Dudak September 2, 2011 at 11:59pm EDT
SO*

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 12:00am EDT
It's basically a lose lose situation

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 12:00am EDT
Sounds awful.

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 12:00am EDT
Lmao oh gosh

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 12:00am EDT
IT IS AWFUL

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
Is there only one computer?

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
Like no laptop or anything?

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
Correct

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 12:06am EDT
Oh my god how do you survive?

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 12:07am EDT
I at least have either a laptop or a notebook or a shitty computer from 10 years ago that still works for some reason

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 12:07am EDT
Idk how

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 12:07am EDT
It's especially frustrating when I'm doing something that takes time

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 12:20am EDT
I can imagine. Things like tumblr

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 12:21am EDT
And facebook status with 100s of comments

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 12:21am EDT
And WoW junk

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 12:26am EDT
Exactly

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 12:26am EDT
Especially wow junk oh man. But that'll change once school starts

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 12:27am EDT
Play time will go down a lot

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 12:29am EDT
I bet the minecraft 1.8 update will come out the day I have a ton of school junk and colorguard stuff to do.

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 12:30am EDT
And my poor tumblr will not have nearly as many awesome pics

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 12:33am EDT
Always happens!

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 12:34am EDT
I still manage to be on tumblr a lot anyhow. No going back now

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 12:35am EDT
Has Kerry posted anything yet?

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 12:40am EDT
5 posts

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 12:40am EDT
All reblogs

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 12:43am EDT
I don't think she's fully accepting tumblr yet

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 12:47am EDT
nope

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 12:47am EDT
but I reblogged them all anyway

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 12:47am EDT
and i got back on the main computer :D

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 12:54am EDT
Yay you!

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 12:57am EDT
kerry now has me solving a riddle about dates and ancient roman ceremonies

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 12:57am EDT
-_-

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 12:58am EDT
Wut

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 12:58am EDT
"OKAY. DEV. YOU MUST HELP ME. WE NEED TO SOLVE RIDDLES IN ORDER TO DETERMINE MY DARLING FRIEND STEPHEN'S BIRTHDAY. I'M PROBABLY NOT SMART ENOUGH TO FIGURE IT OUT. one riddle it is 6 months, 2 weeks, and 5 days after the 2763rd anniversary of the first roman triumph. i know his birthday is in september and the roman triumph was in 753 B.C. so where does that leave us. i don't have a day of the triumph. wahh. HELP ME. I'M DYING. I'VE KNOWN THIS MAN FOR LIKE.. 5 YEARS AND I DON'T KNOW HIS BIRTHDAY. IT KILLS ME, NICHOLAS. KILLLSSSSSS MEEEEEEEEE"

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 1:00am EDT
thats what she said

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 1:00am EDT
o.o

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 1:00am EDT
Well then

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 1:00am EDT
I guess he doesn't choose to show his bday on his fb

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 1:01am EDT
i guess

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 1:01am EDT
and the riddle is very vague

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 1:01am EDT
along with making little sense

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 1:01am EDT
So far I've discovered he was born on 2010

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 1:02am EDT
Yeah I have a sliiiiight feeling that's incorrect

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 1:03am EDT
He graduated when we were freshman

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 1:03am EDT
she said its his birthday from that year

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 1:03am EDT
He's three years older than us

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 1:03am EDT
i love the update delay of ipods :D

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 1:03am EDT
So you figure 91

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 1:04am EDT
thats probly correct

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 1:05am EDT
Yeah lol you need to find the day of the anniversary

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 1:06am EDT
Year means nothing basically

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 1:06am EDT
yep

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 11:26pm EDT
How far are you on the sword? Have you started the final copy yet?

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 11:26pm EDT
YES

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 11:26pm EDT
:D

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
Awesome!

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
And I figured out how to use the java API!!

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
So much progress today

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
I'll send you a pick. I'm drawing the twigs and stufff

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
Dumdum

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
Funfun

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
XML

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
Fml

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
-.-

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
Okay so the white in these isn't gonna stay white

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
That'll be detailed later. Here we go.

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
ILL JUST POST THEM ON YOUR WALL THEY WON'T SEND >:|

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
Close up

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
Mkay

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
This one sent

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 11:34pm EDT
Yep I see that

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 11:34pm EDT
Is there another on my wall?

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 11:35pm EDT
I'm on message app and am too lazy to check

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 11:36pm EDT
Ok let's try the other then.

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 11:36pm EDT
I checked my wall

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 11:36pm EDT
That thing is awesome

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 11:38pm EDT
Fb really fucks up the quality

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 11:38pm EDT
Meh I can see the plant details in the close up

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 11:39pm EDT
I like the red tint on the hilt.

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 11:39pm EDT
But the white isn't staying white and there's still half a blade to go. I tried to send this like 10 tines so idk If you already got that.

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 11:40pm EDT
I got a pick showing the hilt and beginning of blade and a close up showing where you started the plants on the blade

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT
:D

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT
Excellent

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
The plants look cool but I think the shading on that gem could be fixed.

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 11:43pm EDT
It's not done lol I'm doing that later too

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 11:43pm EDT
I'm kind of a mess when I draw.

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 11:43pm EDT
I don't really know how far into that you are though, since gems/ glass have ridiculous shading

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 11:43pm EDT
Oh not very far it seems by my lag

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 11:44pm EDT
Just wanted to make sure

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 11:47pm EDT
Yes yes. I've never been so excited to like draw and stuff

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 11:49pm EDT
How are you gonna make plants? Like wrapped around strangling the blade? or draping it with vines or branches or whatever hanging off?

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 11:50pm EDT
You should be excited this thing will be awesome!

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 11:53pm EDT
Well everything's sorta intertwined. I think I'm gonna draw this and see how it comes out. Cause I was thinking of having leaves hanging off

Steph Dudak September 3, 2011 at 11:53pm EDT
Or at least falling off

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 11:54pm EDT
If you want it to look useless I think that would be good, if it was just wrapped in vines I think it would actually look stronger

Nick Devlin September 3, 2011 at 11:54pm EDT
So stuff hanging off is good

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
Please continue updating! I am probably gonna fall asleep soon, so sorry for when I stop replying.

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 12:05am EDT
I'm almost done drawing the main part of this. Then I gotta colour it

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 12:05am EDT
If you fall asleep I'm just gonna keep posting pics on your wall. I'll probably do that anyway cause it's easier lol

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 12:07am EDT
Hope you don't mind

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 12:08am EDT
Funfun, so when I wake up randomly at like 3 am I get something to do

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 12:08am EDT
Yes!

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 2:47am EDT
i'm still working on this thing

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 3:11am EDT
I think I'm done for tonight

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 6:54am EDT
looks pretty awesome so far

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 6:54am EDT
why am i up at 7 am? I DONT KNOW

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 6:54am EDT
I couldn't fall back asleep

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 5:50pm EDT
This looks so much better in person but anyway. Im almost finished!

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 6:05pm EDT
awesome

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 6:05pm EDT
is that all of the blade?

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 6:05pm EDT
looks short

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 6:06pm EDT
the details look awesome though

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 6:06pm EDT
What are you gonna do for a background?

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 6:07pm EDT
I only have so much space. If I made the blade longer, the handle would be too short.

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 6:07pm EDT
I don't think I'm gonna bother with a background

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 6:07pm EDT
That's a lot of space to fill and that'll take even more time

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 6:08pm EDT
By time I'm done with this I'll have invested at least 10 hours in this project lol it's ridiculous.

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 6:08pm EDT
A little less if you take out some time to take and send pictures and junk

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 6:11pm EDT
oh right, its real paper, I guess you can't just extend the border -.-

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 6:11pm EDT
so used to drawing programs, I still use cntrl z even when writing/ sketching junk

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 6:11pm EDT
anyway

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 6:12pm EDT
thats quite a bit of time

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 6:12pm EDT
you started the last one yet?

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 6:13pm EDT
Exactly. Paper limits. Anyway, nope lol. And I gotta finish my lit assignment too

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 6:13pm EDT
Kill me.

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 6:15pm EDT
you probably should have started this sooner -_-

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 6:15pm EDT
i mean at least I only have one assignment

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 6:15pm EDT
and i can just google fill in answers

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 6:16pm EDT
I should've. Mrs Calicchio should've given this to us at the beginning of summer. But I still had enough time

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 6:16pm EDT
I'm researching two artists for the third assignment

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 6:16pm EDT
So that'll take an hour maybe. Two at most. Same with lit

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 6:16pm EDT
I gotta do the catcher in the rye book review

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 6:17pm EDT
But I don't remember anything about that book.

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 6:17pm EDT
oh you're still doing ap lit?

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 6:18pm EDT
Well

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 6:18pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 6:18pm EDT
Hello Stephanie, There are no more schedules changes until Tuesday 9/6. At that point the only changes will be students who have hard conflicts (errors). Any other changes will not happen until 9/12. Sincerely, Mrs. Monica Santamaria-Vasslides

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 6:19pm EDT
So I figured I might as well finish it so I don't look like a douchebag on the first day.

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 6:19pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 6:20pm EDT
Yes I just sent it to you

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 6:27pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 6:28pm EDT
There are no more schedule changes until Tuesday. At that point the only changes will be students who have hard conflicts (errors). Any other changes won't happen until 9/12.

handwritten please!

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 7:46pm EDT
I have an answer lol I just need to resend it to my email bc it's sideways and I can't rotate it on here and I'm not entirely happy with how this came out lol fuck me

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 7:47pm EDT
Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 7:50pm EDT
that guard is awesome

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 7:50pm EDT
you should probably call it a dagger now

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 7:51pm EDT
Its blade is really tiny

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 7:51pm EDT
:D

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 7:56pm EDT
-_-

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 7:57pm EDT
It's not small enough to be called a dagger though

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 8:02pm EDT
hmm... time to google!

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 8:05pm EDT
it appears blades aren't defined by length by by how they are used, the style they cut in and the arts in which they are used

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 8:05pm EDT
in which case

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 8:05pm EDT
what you made has no name!

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 8:06pm EDT
So I can still call it a sword

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 8:07pm EDT
if you choose to

Nick Devlin September 4, 2011 at 8:07pm EDT
there are examples of swords that small

Steph Dudak September 4, 2011 at 8:23pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:04pm EDT
:D

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:05pm EDT
i could totally finish all the projects super early in that class and hang out there

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:05pm EDT
I usually do that in classes based on projects not actually work

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:06pm EDT
and bother you while you're trying to work

Steph Dudak September 6, 2011 at 3:06pm EDT
thanks XD

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:06pm EDT
the people in the class don't seem like much fun

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:06pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:09pm EDT
spanish 4

Steph Dudak September 6, 2011 at 3:09pm EDT
you took that?

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:10pm EDT
I got sosa, anthony gulino, antonio, and drew in that class

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:10pm EDT
of course i took it

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:10pm EDT
not wasting 10 years of a language i can barely speak

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:10pm EDT
i better get fluent before i'm outta college

Steph Dudak September 6, 2011 at 3:10pm EDT
antonio is in spanish 4?

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:10pm EDT
I KNOW

Steph Dudak September 6, 2011 at 3:11pm EDT
how?

Steph Dudak September 6, 2011 at 3:11pm EDT
he took french for two years

Steph Dudak September 6, 2011 at 3:11pm EDT
wait

Steph Dudak September 6, 2011 at 3:11pm EDT
antonio serrano rite? idk that's the only antonio ik of

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:11pm EDT
yes that one

Steph Dudak September 6, 2011 at 3:11pm EDT
otherwise i take that back

Steph Dudak September 6, 2011 at 3:11pm EDT
HOW

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:12pm EDT
He's already fluent in Spanish

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:13pm EDT
so he for some reason was advised not to take spanish culture or whatever they use for people who speak spanish

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:13pm EDT
because he was too fluent

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:13pm EDT
so somehow he just got in spanish 4

Steph Dudak September 6, 2011 at 3:13pm EDT
so they put him in spanish 4 lol

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:13pm EDT
I mean there is spanish 5, idk why he's not in that

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:14pm EDT
So, during class today, he spoke entirely in Spanish slang/ colloquially

Steph Dudak September 6, 2011 at 3:14pm EDT
omg

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:14pm EDT
just to mess with the teacher, Mika, who even I can tell has never learned it that well

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:14pm EDT
Like she has the same accent as students do

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:15pm EDT
which is very bad

Steph Dudak September 6, 2011 at 3:15pm EDT
haaaaa hahaha

Steph Dudak September 6, 2011 at 3:15pm EDT
that's funny

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:16pm EDT
but the class should be fun I suppose, it feels like I've gone back a year actually

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:16pm EDT
because the teacher is using cute spanish names for everyone and we're playing all those kids games

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:17pm EDT
but whatever

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:17pm EDT
is fun

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:18pm EDT
onto period 7!!

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:19pm EDT
which will be a complete joke if I actually take the class

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:19pm EDT
Web Page design

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:19pm EDT
i might just drop it

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:19pm EDT
since it takes half a year of lunch away

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:20pm EDT
its mostly freshmen

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:20pm EDT
and only 1 kid i actually know

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:21pm EDT
but we go over photoshop

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:21pm EDT
and i really need an intro to that program

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:21pm EDT
maybe i will even be able to steal a copy of the program

Steph Dudak September 6, 2011 at 3:25pm EDT
oh nice

Steph Dudak September 6, 2011 at 3:26pm EDT
you should just drop it and take lunch lol

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:27pm EDT
i'm considering rearranging schedule to have that class instead of study hall

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:27pm EDT
it will be difficult

Steph Dudak September 6, 2011 at 3:31pm EDT
scheduling is difficult

Steph Dudak September 6, 2011 at 3:36pm EDT
this year will be either really awesome or not awesome at all

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:36pm EDT
probly

Steph Dudak September 6, 2011 at 3:36pm EDT
i feel like, stressed. i feel like i'm not gonna be able to handle all the work i have to do

Steph Dudak September 6, 2011 at 3:36pm EDT
I NEED TO FILL 50 pages in my sketchbook

Steph Dudak September 6, 2011 at 3:36pm EDT
by.... september 21st i think

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:36pm EDT
thats like 2-3 pages aday

Steph Dudak September 6, 2011 at 3:42pm EDT
yeeeah

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:42pm EDT
oh look i read your tumblr

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:42pm EDT
you really need to change that schedule

Steph Dudak September 6, 2011 at 3:44pm EDT
/:

Steph Dudak September 6, 2011 at 3:45pm EDT
would art history count as a history class? lol

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:45pm EDT
i almost considered switching to that class

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:45pm EDT
but then i was like nah

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 3:48pm EDT
Steph Dudak September 6, 2011 at 3:49pm EDT
what the heck

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 4:03pm EDT
>

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 4:03pm EDT
?

Nick Devlin September 6, 2011 at 4:03pm EDT
what, what the heck?

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 2:41pm EDT
STEPH!!

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 2:42pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 2:43pm EDT
HAHAHA

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 2:43pm EDT

OMG TODAY

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 2:43pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 2:43pm EDT
luckily i can leave them both at home but omg

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 2:44pm EDT
I can totally see why you're taking the class

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 2:46pm EDT
x.x

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 2:46pm EDT
it's awful. i have to read a poem in one of the books tonight. just a random one.

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 2:46pm EDT
and then talk about it tomorrow

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 2:46pm EDT
why it interested me or some weird thing like that

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 2:47pm EDT
Sounds fun. Are you still considering changing? Or have you resigned yourself to a year of 'fun'

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 2:48pm EDT
idk what i'm going to do yet

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 2:48pm EDT
i have til this weekend to decide womp

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 2:49pm EDT
Do you have a new guidance counselor too? I just looked at my schedule and saw I have a different one. I just applied for a meeting

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 2:50pm EDT
seriously?

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 2:50pm EDT
x.x

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 2:50pm EDT
i hope not

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 2:51pm EDT
If you had santamaria I think she switched to different stuff

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 2:52pm EDT
when i went to see her at the end of the year, there was some other lady in for her

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 2:52pm EDT
bc she was like.... iin training or something for some other sorta position somewhere

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 2:52pm EDT
idr what obv

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 2:53pm EDT
Yep, I think she's in that other position now

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 2:53pm EDT
No one else has her

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 2:54pm EDT
ugh

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 2:54pm EDT
well thats great. who's the person now?

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 2:54pm EDT
Millard

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 2:57pm EDT
I deserve a medal for going this long without making a duck joke of some kind

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 2:58pm EDT
Must've been like a minute and a half

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
I

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
Am so

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
Annoyed

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
because?

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 9:40pm EDT
Could you possibly answer this question for me: Q is a point on the y axis 2radical10 units from the point (6,1). Find out all the possible coordinates of Q. So there'll be two yeah? Cause it's 2radical10 apart from (6,1) on the y axis. So usually I'd think okay. Ill just add the 2radical10 to 1 and then do it negatively as well but you can't add radicals and whole numbers together.

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 9:40pm EDT
Idk what I'm doing. And I cant use a decimal or anything

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 9:41pm EDT
you have to convert your numbers

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 9:41pm EDT
and you're correct about there being 2 seperate points

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
oooh you also have to use the hypotenuse of a right trinagle for this problem

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT
what on earth are you doing? this is 2nd day?!

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT
So what exactly do I need to do then? ^ that was supposed to be sent like five mins ago

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT
Whaaaaat!

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 9:45pm EDT
Yes it is. This is one of 5 problems.

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 9:45pm EDT
I finished three. The last one is to find the slope of (a, a/b) (b, b/a)

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 9:48pm EDT
-.-that sounds annoying

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 9:48pm EDT
I am making diagram on paint to show you this problem

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 9:48pm EDT
That is very much appreciated lol thanks

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
all right so imagine that 2(radical)10 is the radius of a circle

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
the two points you need are the ones that intersect the y axis

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 9:53pm EDT
http://i551.photobucket.com/albums/ii472/dravarian26/MATH.png

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 9:53pm EDT
ignore the numbers i put

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT
so you just need to find the exact points, probably using the pytagorean theorum because you know the length of horizontal leg (6) and the hypotenuse (2radical10)

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT
to find where on the y axis you intersect with the circle

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:03pm EDT
Okay so when squaring that 2radical10 thing. Won't the radical10 become radical 100 and then I end up taking that out as a 10 and multiplying? Byyy four? Bc you square the 2 also don't you? Idk. Is that how Im supposed to Be doing this? If I do that then I get xsquared equals 4 and the other side is then 2.

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:03pm EDT
Idk if thats where I was even supposed to go with that.

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT
Alright do you even care how it happened or do you just want the problem that you need to solve?

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT
Cause I can give you that much easier

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:05pm EDT
I guess so. I need to show some form of work though

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:06pm EDT
yeah i will give you the math, just not explain how it correlated to the actual question

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:09pm EDT
this is the problem you need to solve

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:09pm EDT
http://i551.photobucket.com/albums/ii472/dravarian26/MATH-1.png

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:10pm EDT
you understand that part right?

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:11pm EDT
I basically just did that. You said use the Pythagorean theorem and by doing that I get 2 for x. That's the whole thing I just explained and asked if I was doing it right

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:11pm EDT
then you are doing it right

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:11pm EDT
so your coordinates would end up being 0,3 and 0, -1

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:12pm EDT
problem solved

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:12pm EDT
Now to finish my homework

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:12pm EDT
You're a genius thank you

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:13pm EDT
I'm shocked you're doing hw lol what for?

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:14pm EDT
I have to make 3 sketch title blocks (finishing 2nd now), do 12 problems in comp. science after reading the chapter she didn't go over, right 10 senteces about first day of school in spanish, and try to figure out my schedule

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:14pm EDT
not including the band scheduling

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:15pm EDT
and finding a type font to study for art

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:15pm EDT
and making a poster for juggling club

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:15pm EDT
but thats it

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:16pm EDT
Helvetica is a lovely font.

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:16pm EDT
Goodness that's quite a bit o.o

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:17pm EDT
Title block sketches is easy though

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:17pm EDT
I am starting 3rd now

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:17pm EDT
and i kind of want serifs on my font

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:17pm EDT
You can make em as complex or simple as you want.

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:18pm EDT
Ah I see

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:18pm EDT
Well picking a font isn't too difficult

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
I have a couple, but one I really want I am unable to find

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
Do you need to be able to actually use it for something?

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:20pm EDT
i just want something to base off for making letters

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:20pm EDT
I'm not actually copying just getting ideas

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:20pm EDT
about line thickness and serif placement

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
so that I don't waste hours making each line exactly right, I'll just have references to use

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:22pm EDT
Yeah. I was gonna say just google the font I'm sure there's some examples of it somewhere but yeah

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:25pm EDT
any ideas on what i would do for last title block?

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
i have no brain right now

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
Whatcha got for your first two?

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
i made a honeycomb pattern with hexagons

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
and just filled in that with the text

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
and i got another with no vertical lines and each intersection has a little dot, it looks kind of circuit-y

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
but not really

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
Well you could make some sort of image in the corner/bottom to put the info in. Like a sword o.o I should've thought of that last yr omg. This kid Joe did a train

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
He talked about it

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
I think I've told you that before

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
and the sword idea is cool

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
yes you have talked about

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
I made mine really simple

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
i laughed when he mentioned it

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
Just cause sometimes you can't go wrong with simplicity. And haha that's awesome

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
I made sure not to have a bajillion lines in any, otherwise it would distract from my name!

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
Hahah of course

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
I will just use the sword idea i think

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
Yessss

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
and i will make a little gemstone on the hilt

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
Show me it when you make it or whatever I wanna see!

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:38pm EDT
which of these should i use?

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:38pm EDT
http://www.wjxr.com/images/gemstone_shapes.jpg

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:38pm EDT
and i will take pics or scan them all eventually

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:38pm EDT
when they are done

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:39pm EDT
Marquis or trillion

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:39pm EDT
I actually like trillion most

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:39pm EDT
i was thinking trillion or round

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:39pm EDT
so trillion it is

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:40pm EDT
I vote trillion. It's more interesting

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:44pm EDT
alright sword done

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:44pm EDT
just need to place boxes which i will do in study hall

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
Wooo!

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
es tiempo por espanol!!

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
lo siento. iiEs tiempo por Espanol!!

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
need both exclamations

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:50pm EDT
Fantastique .-. L'espagnol est tres interessant.

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT
you just spoke like archaic spanish

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT
or some romantic language

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
its not french or spanish

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
or portuguese

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
>:|

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
is it french?

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
You know what language that is wacko

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
it doesn't look french

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
Duh

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
It is

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
i guess it is then

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
well, si! es muy muy interesante

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
yo no se como popular sarcasmo es en espanol

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
That's basically the extent of my lingual Abilites. English, some French, and of course "hola" "adios" "bienvenidos" which I don't think I spelled right and "puedo ir el baño" if that's how you spell that.. Probably not.

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
Sarcasm isn't popular in Spanish? You're what?

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
looks right to me, you actually used the little tilde thing

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
i don't know how popular sarcasm is in spanish

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
Ahhhh

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
I have friends in my English class. I'm taking blah blah and o think it's gonna be super awesome

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 11:02pm EDT
I shoved seven freshmen into lockers.

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 11:02pm EDT
i am translating how to say i saw all my friends now

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 11:02pm EDT
This was my last first day of high school

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 11:04pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 11:05pm EDT
What else did you do the first day

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
Are you there for all 8 periods?

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 11:07pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 11:08pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 11:12pm EDT
It's just new to you. You'll get used to if

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 11:12pm EDT
It*

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 11:13pm EDT
i highly doubt that, it's only the first week this won't last past september if even that

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
Yeah probably not since you're a slacker

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
I on the other hand am going to be working like crazy and cannot procrastinate so much

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
or more hopefully i mght just be ahead and ab;e to do stuff in class

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
And I haven't been to my locker once yet

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
Hopefully, I wish you good luck with that though lol

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
yay!!

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
how many books you have so far?

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT
Well as far as text books I have my two lit books and pre calc one. I don't need to carry them to school though. But I might my pre calc one just in case. Then I have two binders even though I prefer notebooks but yk. Gotta have the dumb things

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
No physics textbook yet. Luckily no book for world affairs

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
yeah i'm not using binders at all I think, I am terrible with them. I think that trapper keeper thing for loose leaf and a composition notebook for notes works pretty weel

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
well*

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
seriously? a history class without a notebook?

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
weird

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
Textbook

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
same thing

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
It's world affairs.

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
which is history

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
It's all news and stuff going on in the world

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
Lots of today stuff

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
Not like oh back in 1925...

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
a relevant history class? weirder and weirder

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
The only thing is that 40% of my grade will be class participation

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
Meaning talking. I have 30 something kids in my class as well

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
and you have the class of... "enthusiastic" people

Nick Devlin September 7, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
oh god I don't even want to imagine listening to debates involving wars/ politics

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
I can't even imagine how this class is gonna go

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
But i mean. A bunch of people in there were in my 8th grade class

Steph Dudak September 7, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
And we had mr lee then too

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 7:07pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 9:31pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 9:32pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 9:32pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 9:33pm EDT
Alrighty. And that's alright yo

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
blegh I have so much to do!!!

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
and no time!!!

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
Stress is something I dislike the feeling of

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
I think I'm quiting everything soon

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
You have to prioritize and work around your schedule

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
Do you have a study hall?

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 9:40pm EDT
Well yeah but I can't configure my laptop and install programs there, or cook dinner

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 9:40pm EDT
or buy pants/ socks for tomorrow by 5

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 9:40pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 9:40pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 9:41pm EDT
It's cooking

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
Excellent. And you can configure your laptop and install programs between those little things. Problem solved.

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
I'm not used to doing multiple things at once, especially important things

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 9:45pm EDT
See then you'll just have to take some time to get used to it.

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 9:46pm EDT
I can't wait til school really starts so I can see what a usual work load is going to be like.

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 9:46pm EDT
So far I've had world lit hw everyday this week

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 9:46pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 9:49pm EDT
AP lit homework everyday. First day: write a page "what is literature?". Yesterday I had to find a poem in my 2000+ page textbook, read it, and bc I didn't go today, read it out loud in class tmrw and talk about it. Today I had to ~research (lawl) a short story, novel, or poem, etc, about 9/11 and I need to bring it or info about it in tomorrow for a class discussion.

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT
I also have a physics test this Tuesday or Wednesday depending on what we get done and a pre calc test coming up too. I need a planner.

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT
We better get them and we better get them soon

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 9:53pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 9:56pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
Seriously? That's interesting lol

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
i thought so, mostly because i was wearing a shirt that had monkeys burning homework on it

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 10:01pm EDT
Omg hahaha

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 10:01pm EDT
Perfect school picture day shirt

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 10:02pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT
Sounds like something my brother would wear. Well on a normal day. He hates school. And he's 12.

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT
He had pictures today actually o.O

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 10:05pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 10:06pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 10:08pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 10:40pm EDT
i got the message asking me if i got a message

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 10:40pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT
Damn it. Before that I said. It's cause by then we'll all know how to properly draw a face

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 11:07pm EDT
hahahaha you reblog the lazy one

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
Of course hahah

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
My messages keep telling me they send but then disappear whatthe heck

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 11:12pm EDT
i've only gottne this message for the past 27 minutes

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 11:16pm EDT
I'm so bad at writing

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 11:16pm EDT
these 30 day challenges take me forever

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 11:16pm EDT
i ramble so much

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT
30 day challenges are so much fun lol

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
I like reading other people's. It's interesting.

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
i just assume no one reads mine since they're so long, thus I just write whatever in them

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
Reading other peoples is fun though

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
it's hard to reply since a lot of them i wouldn't want to like, and it feels like too persoanl to talk to them about what they wrote

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
unless its like random maga anime tv show challenge

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
those are different

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
I read your challenge answers lol

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
?!

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
i hope you missed the one about the rock

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
I read that one completely

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
And my other fucking message didn't send again. I said it's kinda entertaining bc I read the things you write in your voice and I've heard you ramble and go off about something so lol

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 11:26pm EDT
yeah I write how I talk, too lazy to actually change my syntax

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 11:26pm EDT
are you using ipod?

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 11:26pm EDT
Unfortunately

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
I still can't type on it bc it's on like a dock. My alarm clock.

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
So I keep backspacing and kdlakgjn it's a pain

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
i can empathize, i am stalling switching to ipod until I finish tumblr junk

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
I need to get a job

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
Then invest in a laptop. Big time.

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 11:34pm EDT
i believe you are completely correct

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 11:39pm EDT
I should get on that womp. Not to mention whenever it is I actually start driving I'll need to have gas money so.

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 11:39pm EDT
So much stuffs to do this year

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 11:45pm EDT
I KNOW

Nick Devlin September 8, 2011 at 11:46pm EDT
i am learning how to drive manual before september is over, i am getting annoyed of asking for rides.

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 11:52pm EDT
Excellent! A very good idea

Steph Dudak September 8, 2011 at 11:56pm EDT
Okay I need to gtfo tumblr and try to sleep so I'm not completely dead tomorrow. Wish me luck. Goodnight!

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:00am EDT
Night, i will sleep after i start a debate about 9/11 with krystin

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:00am EDT
i think that was a bad idea...

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:01am EDT
but have fun sleeping and whatnot

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:01am EDT
Yeah now I'm reading that -_-

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:01am EDT
I just got out of a discussion about religion, now I'm reading through this.

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:01am EDT
I made a response she will reply angrily to :D

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:01am EDT
discusion with who?

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:02am EDT
What if I just don't sleep lmao. She probably will

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:02am EDT
Kevin

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:03am EDT
I don't entirely agree with kristyn on this but I'm too lazy to type everything out on here and whatnot.

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:03am EDT
I've been reflagging kittens all night while she's been arguing lol

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:03am EDT
I noticed

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
I've been doing a lot of books tonight

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
I assume yk what I mean when I say reflagging

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
i guessed

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
So ill no longer correct myself

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
thats fine

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:06am EDT
first she talks to her idol on twitter like 4 times and now she is tumblr famous

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:06am EDT
I think she's moving on to bigger things

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:08am EDT
She's a nut haha

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:08am EDT
just a little one

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:12am EDT
I was joking about sleeping btw. For some reason my dash has become extremely active

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:12am EDT
Moar kittens

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:14am EDT
i was serious about getting onto ipod once i was done with tumblr

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:14am EDT
but thats not happening any time soon

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:18am EDT
Damn tumblr

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:21am EDT
Time to post day 19 of my challenge I suppose! Happy Friday. Friday. Gotta get down on Friday

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:21am EDT
I should so be sleeping rn. Oh well

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:21am EDT
I should have been sleeping two hours ago

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:21am EDT

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
nope

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
1st week of august

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
still though, bit longer than 30 days i think

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:24am EDT
Do you not make up for days you miss?

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:24am EDT
Cause I do that. I'll do two in one day if I missed a day.

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
i used to

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
but the 30 days ended half an hour ago actually

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
i've just been doing them whenever I got around to it for the past week or two

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:28am EDT
Yeah I kinda figured lol eh it doesn't really matter

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:28am EDT
You don't really have to do them consecutively

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:28am EDT
I was going to do a school one for the first da of school

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:28am EDT
but i couldn't find any

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:31am EDT
oh well, and i think krystin is over her 15 minutes of fame

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:32am EDT
Hope she knows that

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:33am EDT
she's the one that stopped it

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:33am EDT
If someone reblogs her post and say adds something. And someone likes that reblogged post, itll send her the note too

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:34am EDT
Since it's her original post.

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:34am EDT
i saw her complain about it

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:34am EDT
So it's not necessarily the original post itself that people are agreeing or disagreeing with

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:34am EDT
i want to send it to a bunch of big pro america tumblrs

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:35am EDT
its the discussions following her main post

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:35am EDT
Most likely yes

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:36am EDT
wrasdftdrsgfhtrs

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:36am EDT
wtf?

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:36am EDT
like seriously

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:36am EDT
The thing is. Im sure if it were the reverse and it was Americans that did something like this to someone else and everyone was generalized she'd have a different opinion

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:37am EDT
If she was the one being put into this generalization of people.

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:38am EDT
I was thinking that as i replied to her message. but i didn't want to point it out

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:40am EDT
I was going to but I didn't feel like getting into a debate

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:40am EDT
Cause that was back when I actually planned to sleep

Nick Devlin September 9, 2011 at 12:40am EDT
well that plan is a bit shot now

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:42am EDT
Just a little bit

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:42am EDT
I took a three hour nap earlier

Steph Dudak September 9, 2011 at 12:42am EDT

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 2:57pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 2:58pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 3:19pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 3:19pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 3:19pm EDT
well idk lol

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 3:20pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 3:20pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 3:20pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 3:20pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 3:21pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 3:21pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 3:21pm EDT
there's like 10 i think though so

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 3:21pm EDT
10 words?

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 3:22pm EDT
we have 80 verbs in our spanish 4 class on Friday :D

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 3:22pm EDT
still hate Antonio

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 3:22pm EDT
what is it just telling the english equivalent or defining them in spanish or

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 3:22pm EDT
and haha antonio

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 3:22pm EDT
its really really easy actually

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 3:23pm EDT
but tis still 80 words

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 3:23pm EDT
and for some reason we are translating from spanish to english

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 3:23pm EDT
which is something that is very bad to do when learning a language at this level

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 3:24pm EDT
well that's easy then

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 3:24pm EDT
if it's just translating it hah

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 3:25pm EDT
the way you are describing the class makes me think I could totally pass it without trying

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 3:25pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 3:26pm EDT
6th

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 3:27pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 3:27pm EDT
I hate thinking

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 3:27pm EDT
i think some colleges accept 3 but probably very few

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 3:29pm EDT
yeah if it's just based on the exam I don't really feel like it

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 3:29pm EDT
but I do

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 3:29pm EDT
But I don't

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 3:31pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:28pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:28pm EDT
but my cats are so adorable skdjhg

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:30pm EDT
those sentences were as unintelligible to me as the icelandic word you posted 3 seconds ago

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:31pm EDT
-.-

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:31pm EDT
sorry, I stared for at least a minute and still have no clue

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:33pm EDT
nevermind

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:33pm EDT
the time has passed

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:33pm EDT
how are you

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:34pm EDT
my emotion currently is mildly amused

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:34pm EDT
y tu?

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:34pm EDT
tired

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:34pm EDT
tired

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:34pm EDT
avoiding homework

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:35pm EDT
that doesn't really describe how i am. avoiding homework. but that's what i'm doing pretty much

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:35pm EDT
when do you wake up?

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:35pm EDT
5:45

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:36pm EDT
not all too fun

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:36pm EDT
averaeg time when you fall asleep?

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:36pm EDT
oh gosh

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:37pm EDT
hm

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:38pm EDT
well it was definitely after 11, i can say that

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:38pm EDT
well that is at most 6 and a half hours

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:38pm EDT
exactly

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:39pm EDT
but i feel like it was a lot later than 11

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:39pm EDT
somewhere between 11 and 1. so we'll say 12 cause i think that might be more accurate.

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:39pm EDT
ive been falling asleep at around 1ish everyday recently except last night

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:39pm EDT
well the healthy amount of sleep for teenagers is about 9 hours

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:40pm EDT
most can deal with like 8 and catch up on weekends

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:40pm EDT
less than that just makes life suck! :D

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:40pm EDT
yeah i get about that much on weekends lol

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:42pm EDT
i don't even know when I sleep anymore, I just read till I'm tired on weekdays

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:46pm EDT
yeah, usually i'm up doing nothing or staying on tumblr too late. issues

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:47pm EDT
/ doing homework

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:47pm EDT
it took forever for me to get that paragraph thing written yesterday

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:48pm EDT
I just did my essay in the morning

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:48pm EDT
I almost printed it out without fixing it

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:48pm EDT
I don't think Having my entire conclusion paragraph being "I am awesome"

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:48pm EDT
would have gone over too well

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:49pm EDT
haaa i wonder how that would've turned out

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:49pm EDT
I think I'm going to make a watermark on all my papers saying I am awesome

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:50pm EDT
she won't see it unless she looks really really hard

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:50pm EDT
speaking of watermarks

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:51pm EDT
and this is totally unrelated but i just noticed it

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:51pm EDT
http://womp-coolyourjets.tumblr.com/ the four links in the boxes on the side, the bottom two are a few pixels off and it's bothering me.

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:52pm EDT
I wasn't gonna say anything

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:52pm EDT
since i thought you'd just tell me to shut up

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:52pm EDT
and no one cares

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:52pm EDT
I got used to it though

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:52pm EDT
it's been like that forever

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:52pm EDT
and it's been bothering me forever

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:52pm EDT
but i can't seem to fix it

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:53pm EDT
there are a billion things that annoy me about mine

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:53pm EDT
I'm just too lazy to fix

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:53pm EDT
It's mostly the fault of my theme

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:54pm EDT
I really have no clue how you change something like that though

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:54pm EDT
I am pretty sure you can't

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:54pm EDT
the thing is like

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:55pm EDT
hold on

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:55pm EDT
i'll show you my dilemma

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:55pm EDT
<b>[</b> The Navigation <b>]</b> <div class="navi"><br> <a href="/archive">Archive</a> <a href="http://womp-coolyourjets.tumblr.com/ask">Ask</a> <a href="http://www.littlemisscait.tumblr.com">Theme</a> <a href="/#">Home</a><br><br>

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:55pm EDT
that's the code for the navigation area

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:55pm EDT
mmhmmm

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:55pm EDT
<div class="navi">

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:55pm EDT
hold on

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:55pm EDT
div.navi a{ text-align: center; padding:3px 0px; color: #a1c622; background-color: #e1ebb1; border: 1px solid #b6d81e; margin-top:2px; position:relative; width: 85px; -moz-box-shadow: 0 0 0px #000000; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 0px #000000; display: inline-block; } div.navi a:hover{ padding:3px 0; color: #ffffff; background-color: #e1ebb1; border: 1px dotted #b6d81e; z-index:2; } }

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:56pm EDT
that is basically what makes up those links

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:57pm EDT
yep it is

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:58pm EDT
I can guess as to what you might change in that code in order to fix

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 4:58pm EDT
but I can't be sure it would work

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 4:58pm EDT
please make a suggestion lol

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:03pm EDT
div.navi a{ text-align: center; padding:3px 0px; color: #a1c622; background-color: #e1ebb1; border: 1px solid #b6d81e; margin-top:2px; position:relative; width: 85px; -moz-box-shadow: 0 0 0px #000000; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 0px #000000; display: inline-block; } div.navi a:hover{ color: #ffffff; background-color: #e1ebb1; border: 1px dotted #b6d81e; z-index:2; } }

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:03pm EDT
that might do something

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:03pm EDT
if not

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:04pm EDT
I can try again by changing something else

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:04pm EDT
and what did you change?

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:04pm EDT
i removed the 3 pixels of padding

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:04pm EDT
nope

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:04pm EDT
tried that

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:04pm EDT
it makes the rectangles shorter in height

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:04pm EDT
did you try changing the width to 82?

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:05pm EDT
that just shortens the width of the rectangles

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:06pm EDT
all of them?

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:06pm EDT
yeah

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:06pm EDT
hmm I'm going to guess you also tried changing the top margin

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:07pm EDT
that changes the space in between the two sets of rectangles

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:08pm EDT
yeah I didn't think that would work

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:09pm EDT
My orignal thought was that the relative positioning was where the problem was

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:09pm EDT
but I have no clue how to fix that

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:09pm EDT
its not

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:09pm EDT
even removing that does nothing

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:09pm EDT
but

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:09pm EDT
if you take out

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:09pm EDT
it's like.. display: inline-block;

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:10pm EDT
that makes all of them go side by side, and just big enough to fit the words

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:11pm EDT
and it's not like each one is in an individual box where i can just change number values

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:11pm EDT
no no, I mean that actual coding of the method relative has flaws

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:12pm EDT
so you you have to write an entire new code in machine language

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:12pm EDT
which i can't do

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:12pm EDT
and removing it will not help

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:12pm EDT
it's basically irrelevant

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:14pm EDT
well seeing as you've tried all the obvious solutions

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:14pm EDT
there isn't much else I can think of

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:14pm EDT
I don't think there's much you can do without professional help

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:15pm EDT
x.x

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:15pm EDT
or at least someone better than me

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:15pm EDT
you don't need professional help for something like this lol

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:15pm EDT
it's been a while. a few years ago i would've been able to code this whole thing myself and we wouldn't be having these problems.

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:16pm EDT
when did you do coding stuff?

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:16pm EDT
back in 6th-8th grade.

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:16pm EDT
started off on a website called buddy4u.com , making layouts and shit

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:16pm EDT
escalated to this; http://www.synyster.ourworkofart.com/ fun little thing

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:17pm EDT
also back in my forum days lol

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:17pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:17pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:17pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:18pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:19pm EDT
what happened?

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:19pm EDT
-.-

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:19pm EDT
JEE THANKS.

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:19pm EDT
that was basically my life throughout middle school & a little more than 1/4 of high school

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:20pm EDT
did you read that last update?

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:20pm EDT
I AM SO SORRY TO EVERYBODY. I never update this thing & asdfghjkl ugh. Okay. So let's see. I haven't updated since... SEPTEMBER 13TH :O!!!

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:20pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:24pm EDT
TWO YEARS AGO EXACTLY

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:26pm EDT
That is so creepy

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:26pm EDT
did you make the photoshop tutorials?

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:26pm EDT
omg ajdkhgsdlfh all this old stuff

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:27pm EDT
i was such a faggot at some points though like you don't even understand. i dunno how i got away with being allowed on the internet.

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:28pm EDT
Well I find it odd that I agreed with half your likes/ interests pages, and hated you for the other half

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:28pm EDT
so

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:28pm EDT
did you make the tutorials?

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:32pm EDT
hmm actually the only thing I actually hated was the trnsformers thing

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:32pm EDT
everything else seemed not stupid

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:32pm EDT
which is odd

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:32pm EDT
but you do for some reason list a knight's tale and click, both of which I thought were awesome

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:33pm EDT
a knight's tale is such a good movie

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:34pm EDT
sdlkhjfkhjfh I HATE READING THROUGH THESE THINGS lol omg

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:35pm EDT
my mood has changed from mildly amused

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:35pm EDT
to highly entertained

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:35pm EDT
in case you were wondering

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:36pm EDT
thank you for sharing. XD.

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:36pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:36pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:37pm EDT
I sit here for months wodering how the hell to even start somethign on photoshop

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:37pm EDT
and you're off making websites?!!?

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:37pm EDT
3 years ago?!?!

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:37pm EDT
i know for a fact that i cheated on the curves one though

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:37pm EDT
yeeeah

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:37pm EDT
like i said that was my life

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:37pm EDT
AND

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:37pm EDT
AT THAT POINT

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:37pm EDT
well a little before that. before i got this computer and redid all my tutorials and stuff

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:38pm EDT
i was the only one who'd use our computer bc it was so slow and stuff

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:38pm EDT
rollovers are fun

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:38pm EDT
this wasn't the first either.

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:38pm EDT
before this, i had a freewebs

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:39pm EDT
after that freewebs, i had a subdomain hosted by this guy joe

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:39pm EDT
attention.pill-pop.net i remember it specifically.

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:39pm EDT
Joe seems like a nice guy

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:39pm EDT
eventually that had to go

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:39pm EDT
but he helped me a lot

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:39pm EDT
HE WAS

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:39pm EDT
he was freakin awesome

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:39pm EDT
I read about him on your sitre

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:40pm EDT
i forgot about that page

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:40pm EDT
I found all the pages don't worry

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:41pm EDT
you do know that I can't stop thinking of my immortals every time I see the word synyster

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:42pm EDT
lmao

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:42pm EDT
YEAH AND TIFF YOU KNOW TIFF. she used to do all this stuff with me. mainly on b4u but yeah. i'm reading through this

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:42pm EDT
fkjhf

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:43pm EDT
I found the obliteresqueblablabla thing very funny as well

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:44pm EDT
That was the weirdest thing lol. One of the first layouts featured the Veronicas. But that one didn't last long at all.

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:45pm EDT
I'm going to have to find a way to use that site

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:45pm EDT
Bc then tiff and the girl, idk if I mention it but her actual name was Hilary, kinda stopped with that stuff so.

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:46pm EDT
That's how I kept myself busy.

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:47pm EDT
better than what I did

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:47pm EDT
forums were so cool

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:48pm EDT
ohmygod

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:48pm EDT
it still works!

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:48pm EDT
my old password is so stupid

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:49pm EDT
not that my new one is any better

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:49pm EDT
but still

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:53pm EDT
all the forums i was on

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:53pm EDT
are now gone lol

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:53pm EDT
we tried so hard to keep it going but it failed

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:54pm EDT
last would be vuze mb

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:55pm EDT
i think that one is finally gone

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:57pm EDT
I think all mine are still up and running

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:57pm EDT
like people still go there

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:57pm EDT
its really weird

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:57pm EDT
I recognize some usernames

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:57pm EDT
they've upgraded everything so it's all shiny

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:58pm EDT
oh gosh

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:58pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:58pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:58pm EDT
in the past 15 minutes

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:58pm EDT
I guess it got pretty popular

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:59pm EDT
Maybe I shouldn't have lef

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 5:59pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 5:59pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 6:00pm EDT
but yeah

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 6:00pm EDT
http://lightsmb.com/ i was on that for a bit, after one of the forums i was originally on started going. i dont think i was like legitimately on it though

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 6:01pm EDT
http://flauntymb.com/ that was first. it was run by a girl named emilee i think. but it looked more like lights back in the day. but then it shut down, so most of us moved and made a new one ourselves.

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 6:01pm EDT
then it went back up and skdjkdlhjfkh

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 6:01pm EDT
quite a while later though

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 6:05pm EDT
You seem like really involved in the things you do

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 6:05pm EDT
I mostly just kind of creeped around reading other posts

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 6:05pm EDT
and occasionally made comments in the conversations

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 6:14pm EDT
oh yeah

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 6:15pm EDT
no i was like in the conversations, i was an admin on two of the forums

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 6:15pm EDT
cause we had our little ~group. a bunch of those people i'm friends with on here

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 6:15pm EDT
but i don't really talk to em anymore lol

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 6:15pm EDT
damn, I only have mod/ admin status on my minecraft forum

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 6:16pm EDT
and even that is only on the server not actually in the forum

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 6:16pm EDT
yeah lol did all that stuff. worked on themes and the colour schemes. that stuff was fun XD

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 6:19pm EDT
that is pretty awesome, not gonna lie

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 6:26pm EDT
glad you think so lol. without all that stuff, i don't think i'd be where i'm at now.

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 6:27pm EDT
i definitely wouldn't have taken computer graphics freshman year.

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 6:28pm EDT
yep I think the same thing about that forum

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 6:28pm EDT
most of the books I read

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 6:28pm EDT
it's really weird. like thinking about all the little things that change your entire life

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 6:28pm EDT
like i constantly look back on those things

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 6:29pm EDT
constantly.

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 6:29pm EDT
and think what if?

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 6:29pm EDT
:D

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 6:30pm EDT
if i didn't move out of bloomfield, i wouldn't have moved here. i wouldn't have become friends with tiff, i wouldn't have even discovered buddy4u, then the forums, and do the whole subdomain thing. i wouldn't have continued on with computer and art classes as my main enjoyment out of school. i'd be a completely different person.

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 6:30pm EDT
yeah lol

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 6:30pm EDT
i wrote like a freakin novel for one of those 30 day posts omg i didn't expeect it to get so long

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 6:31pm EDT
I did! but that's because I always go on tangents like that

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 6:31pm EDT
and my what ifs are insane

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 6:31pm EDT
i have to stop myelf

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 6:31pm EDT
I start plotting the repercussions of every thought I did or didn't have

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 6:32pm EDT
Things like my juggling, or discovering vlogbrothers on youtube, randomly joining colorguard last june

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 6:33pm EDT
those things are so important and they started on such an off chance

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 6:34pm EDT
i always look back on the little things i didn't do

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 6:34pm EDT
and then it pisses me off cause then it woould've caused things to go so much better

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 6:34pm EDT
but it's too late lo

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 6:34pm EDT
l

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 6:35pm EDT
well i know i always think of amazing comebacks

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 6:35pm EDT
like 3 days aftera conversation

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 6:35pm EDT
LIKE LAST YEAR WHEN WE HAD TO DO DEBATES

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 6:35pm EDT
ugh yes

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 6:36pm EDT
i always think of this awesome thing i could've said, meanwhile i'm walking down my street coming home from school.

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 6:37pm EDT
I like writing online that way, it gives you a chance to think and edit what you say without seeming weird

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 6:37pm EDT
just pausing and staring off into space for 3 minutes

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 6:37pm EDT
hahahaha that'd be kinda funny though

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 6:38pm EDT
not if it happened for every single reply

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 6:38pm EDT
which I tend to do

Steph Dudak September 13, 2011 at 6:41pm EDT
welll that'd be awful then

Nick Devlin September 13, 2011 at 6:42pm EDT
Which is why I either say nothing or just say something stupid

Steph Dudak September 18, 2011 at 7:06pm EDT
extremely

Steph Dudak September 18, 2011 at 7:06pm EDT
my whole life is a lie

Nick Devlin September 18, 2011 at 7:07pm EDT
my life revolved around cake

Nick Devlin September 18, 2011 at 7:07pm EDT
then i played portal

Nick Devlin September 18, 2011 at 7:07pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 18, 2011 at 7:07pm EDT
hahahaha

Steph Dudak September 18, 2011 at 7:07pm EDT
omg haha

Steph Dudak September 18, 2011 at 7:09pm EDT
i seriously laughed at that a lot

Nick Devlin September 18, 2011 at 7:10pm EDT
i'm glad I laughed at it a lot too, so I kinda felt like a loser for laughing at a joke i hadn't even written

Steph Dudak September 18, 2011 at 7:20pm EDT
That's okay

Steph Dudak September 18, 2011 at 7:20pm EDT
That is a perfect joke

Nick Devlin September 18, 2011 at 7:21pm EDT
i'm probably gonna use it like 10 more times, glad i had this conversation in order to think of it

Nick Devlin September 18, 2011 at 7:21pm EDT
owait

Nick Devlin September 18, 2011 at 7:21pm EDT
dammit

Nick Devlin September 18, 2011 at 7:21pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 18, 2011 at 7:23pm EDT
well the portal refernce

Nick Devlin September 18, 2011 at 7:24pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 18, 2011 at 7:25pm EDT
Well they'll know once you say it

Steph Dudak September 18, 2011 at 7:25pm EDT
So basically, you can't go wrong with telling that to people

Nick Devlin September 18, 2011 at 7:27pm EDT
very well i shall setup this joke for weeks leaving hints of cake obsession

Nick Devlin September 18, 2011 at 7:27pm EDT
then when the moment is right

Nick Devlin September 18, 2011 at 7:27pm EDT
i will strike and tell my amazing cportal joke

Nick Devlin September 18, 2011 at 7:27pm EDT
and i will become master of the universe

Nick Devlin September 18, 2011 at 7:27pm EDT
the end

Steph Dudak September 18, 2011 at 7:30pm EDT
I'm sure that's exactly how it'll happen

Nick Devlin September 18, 2011 at 7:30pm EDT
i think so too

Nick Devlin September 18, 2011 at 7:30pm EDT
then everyone will bake me plain chocolate cake with nothing on it

Nick Devlin September 18, 2011 at 7:30pm EDT
cause thats my favorite

Steph Dudak September 18, 2011 at 7:47pm EDT
That's interesting

Steph Dudak September 18, 2011 at 7:47pm EDT
Just plain cake

Nick Devlin September 18, 2011 at 7:47pm EDT
plain *chocolate* cake

Steph Dudak September 18, 2011 at 7:48pm EDT
Plain chocolate cake, my bad. So do you not like cake with icing on it? Or you just don't prefer it?

Nick Devlin September 18, 2011 at 7:49pm EDT
i don't like icing

Nick Devlin September 18, 2011 at 7:53pm EDT
...

Nick Devlin September 18, 2011 at 7:53pm EDT
why am I discussing me preferences in cake?

Nick Devlin September 18, 2011 at 7:53pm EDT
-_-

Nick Devlin September 18, 2011 at 7:54pm EDT
we should really be talking about YOUR preferences in cake

Steph Dudak September 18, 2011 at 7:58pm EDT
I like ice cream cake

Steph Dudak September 18, 2011 at 7:58pm EDT
I don't really like cake. But I like cupcakes.

Nick Devlin September 18, 2011 at 7:58pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 18, 2011 at 7:59pm EDT
What kind of ice cream cake?

Steph Dudak September 18, 2011 at 7:59pm EDT
Or cupcakes?

Nick Devlin September 18, 2011 at 7:59pm EDT
there's a difference?

Steph Dudak September 18, 2011 at 8:01pm EDT
Uh duh? It doesn't matter what kinda ice cream cake. Chocolate, vanilla. Both. Whatever. Has to have those crunchy things in the middle. And I like vanilla cupcakes.

Steph Dudak September 18, 2011 at 8:01pm EDT
Favorite. With vanilla icing of course.

Nick Devlin September 18, 2011 at 8:02pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 19, 2011 at 9:49pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 19, 2011 at 9:50pm EDT
Lmao. That picture was taken on the first day of school.

Steph Dudak September 19, 2011 at 9:50pm EDT
I was messing around on photobooth and figured it was weird and decent enough to post

Steph Dudak September 19, 2011 at 9:50pm EDT
Cause I didn't wanna pick a fb picture.

Steph Dudak September 19, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT
Not that an explanation was needed for that.

Giants won. Yay

Nick Devlin September 20, 2011 at 6:01am EDT
I was not awake, just a's I doubt you are awake right now. I will be missing some of school today apparently.

Steph Dudak September 20, 2011 at 6:04am EDT
Why?

Nick Devlin September 20, 2011 at 6:06am EDT
My sister and mom are at hospital and I have no way of getting to school

Steph Dudak September 20, 2011 at 6:06am EDT
Are they okay? O.o and why don't you text Kerry or someone and ask her if she can drive you.

Nick Devlin September 20, 2011 at 6:08am EDT
I have literally no clue, my mom just called and told me about it, she didn't sound like panicked so I'm guessing shes somewhat ok

Nick Devlin September 20, 2011 at 6:08am EDT
And I'm allowed to do that? I never texted anyone for a ride

Steph Dudak September 20, 2011 at 6:09am EDT
Better do it now rather than layer Kim

Steph Dudak September 20, 2011 at 6:09am EDT
Sorry not Kim but wtf there's a spider crawling on my floor god fucking damn it

Nick Devlin September 20, 2011 at 6:10am EDT

Steph Dudak September 20, 2011 at 6:10am EDT
He's still asleep. He doesn't need to wake up for another half hour

Steph Dudak September 20, 2011 at 6:12am EDT
He may have to get woken up though. Snkgnfjnj. It's gone

Nick Devlin September 20, 2011 at 6:13am EDT
But the question is, where did it go?

Nick Devlin September 20, 2011 at 6:13am EDT
My thought? In your hair

Nick Devlin September 20, 2011 at 6:13am EDT
:D

Steph Dudak September 20, 2011 at 6:15am EDT

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:13pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:14pm EDT
a thought. would you write it like. <i>Maybe hell know whose it is</i>, she thought to herself. (course that being italicized. hence the. yeah.)

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:14pm EDT
or like

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:14pm EDT
why don't ik how to write

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:15pm EDT
thoughts are usually italicized yes

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:15pm EDT
thoughts, dreams, memories, telepathy

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:15pm EDT
yes, but like. that's how i should write it, yeah?

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:15pm EDT
yes it is

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:16pm EDT
everything inside the quotes of what she is thinking is italicized

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:16pm EDT
the part of sentence explaing that she thought it is not

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:16pm EDT
so wait

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:16pm EDT
i need to include quotation marks?

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:16pm EDT
oh okay

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:16pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:17pm EDT
its fine, I write ambiguously very often

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:18pm EDT
okay lets say i wrote this

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:18pm EDT
After what seemed to be an eternity of examining and handling the sword and asking herself tons of questions, Alesca decided to continue on to meet Brother Thomas, taking the sword with her. Maybe hell know whose it is, she thought to herself. Unfortunately, Brother Thomas was not able to give Alesca any useful information about the sword.

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:18pm EDT
should i separate

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:18pm EDT
Unfortunately . . .

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:18pm EDT
into a second paragraph?

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
you should do it anyway, just because you are changing thought

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
yes you are making unfortunately a new paragraph

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
thank you lol

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:20pm EDT
and the Maybe he'll know... is italicized

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:20pm EDT
you also used the word and too many times in the first sentenece

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:20pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
After what seemed to be an eternity of examining and handling the sword and asking herself tons of questions After what seemed to be an eternity of examining and handling the sword *while* asking herself tons of questions

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
twice is one too many

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
okay

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
you'll have to help me here with replacing words

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
and tons could have a better synonym i think

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT

After what seemed to be an eternity of examining and handling the sword while asking herself hundreds of questions, Alesca decided to visit Brother Thomas. Maybe hell know whose it is, she thought to herself. Unfortunately, Brother Thomas was not able to give Alesca any useful. He did, however, suggest that she meet with Cobus-- one of the best blacksmiths in Iladria and a close friend of Alesca.

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
information is after the word usefil

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
Iladar

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
is the place they live

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
Iladarian is what they are

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
i just guessed the original name

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
but yeah, the main thing was that you pointed out the sword like 50 times

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
when it was already established that the sword was the main subject

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
today is a bad day for writing

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
thank you

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
also sword noises

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
swish and thwack are the best I got

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
..shink? meh

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
yeah i got nothing

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:50pm EDT
alright this might not work

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
Yserion now resides in a castle to the north

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
should north be capitalized

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
I am thinking yes

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
but I will check

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
no

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
you don't

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
don't capitilize

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
okie

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
wait can you put the sentence in it paragraph?

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
i need to know exactly how north is being used

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
there are like 10 rules that could change it

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
Yserion now resides in a castle to the north but has been known to come down and destroy lands purely out of anger. jnsp

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
to the north of their present location?

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
or in the northern part of country?

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
eh i shouldn't make it northern part of their country

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
because

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
yserion kinda destroys the eastern part of it

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
so if they are using it in reference to their current location

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
it is not capitalized

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
k

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
we'll do that

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
kk

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:02pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT
ok time to go into hyperspeed mode

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT
or somethin glike that

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:04pm EDT
good idea

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:04pm EDT
One does not simply walk into Estraza's temple!

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:04pm EDT
in thwe winter

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:04pm EDT
i should totally use that as a line rite. lawl.

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:04pm EDT
do it

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:05pm EDT
Word is shes returned to her temple though and shes planning ahead this time. We should go there and help, Alesca suggested. Cobus immediately stopped moving. One does not simply walk into Estrazas temple!

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
perfect.

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
i'm doing it.

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
i'm not kidding.

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
i just need to complete that thought.

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
why wouldn't you, its not like she'll get any references from it

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:07pm EDT
and if she does then she'll probly just laugh

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:08pm EDT
#winning

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:09pm EDT
cobus is gonna be really nervous and chicken to go at first

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:09pm EDT
yeeeeah

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:09pm EDT
why is he going in first?

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:09pm EDT
nevermind

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:09pm EDT
i read it wrong

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:09pm EDT
I dont think shes gotten to him in time before it was too late. Shes been around aiding other lands and allies these days but word is shes returned to her temple and shes planning ahead this time. We should go there and help, Alesca suggested. Cobus immediately stopped moving. One does not simply walk into Estrazas temple! Do you even think shed accept our help? What do you even mean we should help! Im up for a battle as much as the next guy but Yserions destroyed thousands of people in an instant! Theres no way wed survive! We have our whole lives ahead of us, I cant die yet!

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
i like cobus' character

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
he seems smart

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:13pm EDT
the first piece of dialogue where cobus is talking about estraza makes no sense

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:13pm EDT
I have no clue what you are trying to say

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
you don't need to know

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
what's before it makes it make sense

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
and i need to reword it anyway

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
I dont think shes gotten to him in time before it was too late.

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
it doesn't matter what context that sentence is in

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
I KNOW

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
SHUSH

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
:D

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
I ALREADY FIXED IT

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
sheesh

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
Well I want to know the story!!

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
but that does make sense in my head

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
lots of things make sense in my head

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
doesn't mean anyone else knows what the fuck im talking about

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
things like mlp

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
whyu dont people get it?

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
thats more than 5

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
...3

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
5 is more than 5

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
i might go to bed and wake up early to finish this.

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
be a good idea

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
sleep is always fun

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:31pm EDT
THIS IS SO AWFUL

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:31pm EDT
what time will i need to wake up?

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:31pm EDT
4?

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
cause 5 i'd only have an hour to write it maybe

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
i still need to shower in the morning

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
and i need them to talk to estraza and then go to yserion's castle, and then defeat him

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
okay this is a shitty paragraph idc but

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
Alesca and Cobus left at dawn the day after. The journey to Estrazas temple was fairly short and easier than they had anticipated, although Cobus did almost run them into a patch of quick sand. But they made it to the temple in a little more than a days travel. While the temple was heavily guarded, Alesca and Cobus were able to easily persuade the guards to let them in once they presented the sword.

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
how can i lead that

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
into

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
no

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
nevermind

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
i'm gonna work on this for a few more mins, go to bed, then wake up super early tomorrow and everything will be fine.

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
procrastination ftl.

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
super early?

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
as in?

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:48pm EDT
Idk

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:49pm EDT
Early. I need to give myself enough time to write it though.

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:50pm EDT
The ending will be rushed. I'm on page 6 but I'm at the point where they're being attacked on the way to Yserion.

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:50pm EDT
Then I just gotta get through that, Yserion and Estraza need to speak a bit, battle will commence, and they win and it's done.

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:50pm EDT
funfun

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:51pm EDT
what perios is it due?

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:51pm EDT
6th

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:51pm EDT
But I'm typing it so that's irrelevant

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:51pm EDT
you probly don't have library access before that period

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:52pm EDT
to edit or anything

Steph Dudak September 22, 2011 at 11:52pm EDT
Nope

Nick Devlin September 22, 2011 at 11:52pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 6:08am EDT
I printed out my essay at like 5:45 lol. And my black ink decided it was gonna start running out. So half my story is like grey, the first page is black, and the rest are a dark blue. 9 fucking pages. Shes gonna kill me.

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 6:08am EDT
I couldn't find a way to shorten it for the life of me. And it's not even that good.

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 6:09am EDT
9 pages?

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 6:09am EDT
i think you could probably edit that an itty bit

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 6:10am EDT
but the ink shouldn't matter

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 6:10am EDT
No. I can't.

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 6:10am EDT
save the document to your email

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 6:10am EDT
I mean yeah if I take out some details I guess. But then they don't have a purpose for anything

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 6:10am EDT
If I do that

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 6:10am EDT
I meant in overall story

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 6:11am EDT
but editing taking longer than writing

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 6:11am EDT
so you couldn't do it before school

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 6:11am EDT
I need to have three adventures in it

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 6:11am EDT
And no. It's staying 9 pages. Idgaf. She can't expect me to write an epic story in 2-3 pages

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 6:12am EDT
It's due today so.

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 6:12am EDT
yeah its not really that important, just turn it in

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 6:12am EDT
I mean if it wasn't double spaced it'd be shorter lol but it's not therefore it isn't.

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 6:13am EDT
hahhaha DOUBLESPACED AND 3 pages epic story

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 6:13am EDT
It makes me mad though cause like. Idk. I didn't want it to get that long. But I'm awful at shortening things to begin with.

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 6:13am EDT
she's out of her mind

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 6:13am EDT
RIGHT?!

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 6:14am EDT
It makes me want to kill myself. But as long as I get a decent grade it's whatever. And she said I was allowed to do more than three pages so it's her fault if she doesn't feel like reading it all lol. Bc she also said there isn't really a limit to how much I can write

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 6:15am EDT
you should have said like 3?

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 6:15am EDT
ohhhh

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 6:15am EDT
i thought you said 30

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 6:15am EDT

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 6:17am EDT

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 6:17am EDT

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 6:18am EDT

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 2:15pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 2:17pm EDT
i like the reasons for why yserion is evil

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 2:17pm EDT
i cant tell if that was sarcasm but i made that up on the spot

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 2:19pm EDT
i think as i was typing it

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 2:19pm EDT
i was at the point where i didn't care how it sounded

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 2:19pm EDT
i just wanted to get it done

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 2:19pm EDT
no sarcasm

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 2:20pm EDT
it was better done than I thought it would be

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 2:21pm EDT
jee thanks lol

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 2:23pm EDT
well its difficult to create motivation for the bad guy in black and white good vs evil stories

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 2:25pm EDT
yeah i gotchu

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 2:26pm EDT
grrr reading this is so annoying

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 2:26pm EDT
you really should expand this story one day

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 2:26pm EDT
I'M SORRY

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 2:26pm EDT
It feels like it'd be awesome if it wasn't so shrunken down

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 2:26pm EDT
skljhkflhr

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 2:26pm EDT
and it's 9 pages lol

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 2:26pm EDT
IMAGINE THIS IN THREE PAGES

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 2:27pm EDT
I KNOw

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 2:28pm EDT
I think the only major thing that was weird, besides the rushed pace, was how they talked

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 2:28pm EDT
I got used to it

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 2:28pm EDT
So basically write this story for real

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 2:28pm EDT
i felt like

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 2:29pm EDT
the way i made alesca and cobus talk, is the way i'd talk kinda lol. know what i mean? estraza's a little more proper. a little. annd. yeah it doesn't necessarily take place in the past so

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 2:29pm EDT
they talk exactly how you talk

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 2:30pm EDT
i wasn't gonna point it out

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 2:30pm EDT
exactly lol

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 2:30pm EDT
i noticed that as i was writing it

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 2:30pm EDT
and i was like EH

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 2:30pm EDT
not everyone talks in perfect, proper english and everything. i'll just let them talk how i talk and it'll be all good and dandy.

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 2:31pm EDT
although i understand that that could get annoying depending on who's reading it

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 2:31pm EDT
It doesn't particulary fit the setting, but I got used to it near the end

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 2:32pm EDT
which should have been the end of the first chapter If your teacher was cool enough to actually let you right an epic

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 2:32pm EDT
then again i didn't make any very vivid descriptions of the places they were at

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 2:34pm EDT
there were lots of cool things that could be added, but not really cuse of time and text limit

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 2:36pm EDT
i could've done a lot more with this for sure

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 2:36pm EDT
if i wasn't so limited

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 2:37pm EDT
its the man putting you down

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 2:37pm EDT
REBEL

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 2:37pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 3:04pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 3:04pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 3:04pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 3:50pm EDT
...?

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 3:51pm EDT
we wiped three times. this is not hard

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 3:51pm EDT
the people you playing with suck?

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 3:52pm EDT
we dont have a lotta control on the spirits

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 3:52pm EDT
cause we have 2 melee and only one ranged

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 3:53pm EDT
sounds annoying

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 3:55pm EDT
so like

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 3:55pm EDT
theyre just dumb

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 3:55pm EDT
the tank was pulling the beserkers that had to break the bubbles on the chains out too quick

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 3:56pm EDT
like before we had other chains down

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 3:56pm EDT
and to break the bubbles you need to stand by a chain and the berserker body slams someone

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 3:56pm EDT
and it breaks

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 3:56pm EDT
if you miss a slam it's annoying bc then no broken bubble, therefore no broken down chain, therefore lose

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 3:57pm EDT
and losing causes fdsnajlsnerdf to be typed

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 3:57pm EDT
exactly

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 3:58pm EDT
are you trying again?

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 3:59pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT
it must be a sign

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 11:26pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 11:31pm EDT
exactly. it's not even something worth questioning

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 11:31pm EDT
so back to the main question is wow in beta?

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 11:31pm EDT
no its not

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 11:39pm EDT
I don't remember why I wanted to know, but thanks for telling me

Steph Dudak September 23, 2011 at 11:43pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 11:45pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 23, 2011 at 11:45pm EDT
well i don't think minecraft will ever not be beta

They'll be fine after a week or so hopefully

Nick Devlin September 24, 2011 at 12:24am EDT
And if you've only had her for two day she might not actually be quiet, she might just be getting used to new place

Nick Devlin September 24, 2011 at 12:24am EDT
Then once she knows she lives there shell start being more annoying

Nick Devlin September 24, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
Hopefully not

Steph Dudak September 24, 2011 at 12:26am EDT
yeah hopefully not lol. she seems at least slightly comfortable already yaknow. i came home last night and i didnt feel like taking my keys out and the door was locked. so i knocked and then i heard barking and i was like wtf i don't have a dog

Steph Dudak September 27, 2011 at 9:45pm EDT
Is it like. Overused ideas, something that when you'd read ityou feel like it's typical

I see

Nick Devlin September 27, 2011 at 9:46pm EDT
Oh I found the series I read as well, it is called Falconfar

Nick Devlin September 27, 2011 at 9:49pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 27, 2011 at 9:49pm EDT
its like the equivalent of an action movie

Nick Devlin September 27, 2011 at 9:50pm EDT
some loser author gets sucked into his book/ video game series and travels with a godly hot chick

Nick Devlin September 27, 2011 at 9:50pm EDT
and somehow is able to hold his own

Nick Devlin September 27, 2011 at 9:50pm EDT
against the forces of darkness

Steph Dudak September 27, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT
Womp

Nick Devlin September 27, 2011 at 9:56pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 2, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
How on earth do you write essays?

Steph Dudak October 2, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 2, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
it usually starts with a topic

Nick Devlin October 2, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 2, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
then you can either use pen and paper

Steph Dudak October 2, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
pencil and paper

Steph Dudak October 2, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
or your computer

Steph Dudak October 2, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
as in typing

Nick Devlin October 2, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
check

Steph Dudak October 2, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
and then printing it off word

Nick Devlin October 2, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
I think you skipped a part or 20 in between

Steph Dudak October 2, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 2, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 2, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 2, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 2, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 2, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 2, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 2, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
do I repeat everything a quadrillion time like they always teach us?

Steph Dudak October 2, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
that's basically a general format

Steph Dudak October 2, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
no

Steph Dudak October 2, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
don't repeat yourself a milllion times

Steph Dudak October 2, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
unnecessary

Nick Devlin October 2, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
all right, that makes it easier

Nick Devlin October 2, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
and should i not use personaly pronouns

Nick Devlin October 2, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 2, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 4, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
yeah krystin annoys me too now

Steph Dudak October 4, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT
-shakes head0

Steph Dudak October 4, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT
-

Steph Dudak October 4, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
ridiculous yo

Steph Dudak October 4, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
Wait when did she say that

Nick Devlin October 4, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
Like 3 minutes before I sent it to you. I made some joke on one of posts about the correct usage of your/ you're

Nick Devlin October 4, 2011 at 11:08pm EDT
Then when I responded she 'corrected' my spelling of the word humour

Steph Dudak October 4, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
She doesn't like the ~British spelling of words

Steph Dudak October 4, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
She gets real pissy about it

Nick Devlin October 4, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
Good my reply included about 3 or 4 of then

Nick Devlin October 4, 2011 at 11:16pm EDT
Why does she make trolling so easy, I think she wants me to instigate her

Steph Dudak October 4, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
Keep doing it lol. She basically asks for it.

Steph Dudak October 4, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT
I like when people can't tell if people are trolling, also. It makes things even better.

Nick Devlin October 4, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
With me I usually try to make it as obvious as possible, which is why I find it weird when people think it's serious. But it can be amusing to watch people struggle to debate someone who is trolling

Steph Dudak October 4, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
Kids these days

Steph Dudak October 4, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
Just don't understand

Steph Dudak October 4, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
The fine art that is trolling

Nick Devlin October 10, 2011 at 9:48pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 10, 2011 at 10:03pm EDT

Thaaaanks

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:14pm EDT
if you were

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:14pm EDT
to start off something with a quote. from a person

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:14pm EDT
in like a written thing

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:14pm EDT
would you write it like Make the most of yourself, for that is all there is of you (Ralph Waldo Emerson). oooooooooooooor

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:18pm EDT
orrr?

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:19pm EDT
oooooooooooor is that not how you do it

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:19pm EDT
what is the written thing?

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:19pm EDT
if that's how you are starting like an essay or something

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:19pm EDT
hmm

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:19pm EDT
depends

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:19pm EDT
research paper, no

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:20pm EDT
informal, no

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:20pm EDT
actually it doesn't depend

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:20pm EDT
its wrong either way :D

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:20pm EDT
well it could be improved at least

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:20pm EDT
if its just an essay for some random thing

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:20pm EDT
it'd be better to say

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:20pm EDT
can you just tell me

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:20pm EDT
how to write it

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:20pm EDT
omg

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:20pm EDT
Ralph Emerson once stated "blablablba"

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:20pm EDT
or some form of that

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:21pm EDT
if it s super research paper formal

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:21pm EDT
and you need citation

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:21pm EDT
kaaay

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:21pm EDT
then you have to cite better

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:21pm EDT
the way you have it kind of combine both

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:23pm EDT
are you doing it the first way i told you?

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:23pm EDT
or do you need it in citation form?

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:23pm EDT
i don't

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:23pm EDT
i'll just do it the other way thanks

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:24pm EDT
aight

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:28pm EDT
required?

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:28pm EDT
because previously it was optional?

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:29pm EDT
it wasn't really optional

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:29pm EDT
but it wasn't really required either

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:30pm EDT
now it is?

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:30pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
because that was another one of my goals for high school

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
since like freshman year

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
CRUSHED

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
like a spider.

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
because no one likes spiders

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
boris the spider

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
and no one likes my hopes and dreams

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
!!!!!

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
there was a giant orange spider outside my house once

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
that my dad named boris

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
have i told you that?

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
nope

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
please continue

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
well that's weird

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
since you just said boris the spider

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
do you know why it was named boris?

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
NO i don't know why nor did i really care at the time

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
does your dad like the who?

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
iiiii dunno

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvFuUaCe8eY&feature=related

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:42pm EDT
i'll watch that in a bit

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:42pm EDT
how doyou say

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:42pm EDT
"You should consider me" without actually using those words..

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
don't use them at all

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
like lolol you should consider me as a member for nhs or somethin like that bc bksjdblkjklnjs

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
DUH

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
i have other hw to do still

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
the essay itself is a blatant "you should consider me"

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
yeah

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
but like, this is a closing thing

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
putting them in the paper is superfluous

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
i need like a

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
closer?

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
IM NOT SAYING

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
THE WORDS

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
YOU SHOULD CONSIDER ME

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT
i'm SAYING, i need something that just relates to that, to close this up.

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT
you know what

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT
nevermind

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT
but even saying in other words, is just odd

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT
i'll figure it out myself.

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT
i can understand the need though

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT
that's not what i mean

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT
i get what you mean, i just need to type things that annoy you while i think

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT

OKAY BUT REALLY

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:45pm EDT
skdgjrksjh

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:46pm EDT
try something like... "The best reasons for me to be in NHS blablablabla" or "the qualities that exemplify me blablbala"

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:47pm EDT
i can't think of a way to not make it sound so arrogant though

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:49pm EDT
yeah i know but you kind of have no choice lol. i threw in like a flaw or somethin when talking about how awesome i am and how punctual i am and blahblahblah. i dont really know how to close it though.. maybe with some weird little sentence followed by some bs like

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:49pm EDT
idk

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:50pm EDT
blahblahblah because i am a reliable and responsible person who has come to enjoy participating in school activities and can do what is expected of me. or something dumb like that. what is expected of me? obviously i can do that what. becoming a member of NHS will help me not only become even more involved in school (aside from classes) but enable me to put everything I have learned to additional use as well as help my peers and give back to my community.. lolol okkkkkkkkkk

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:50pm EDT
am i dumb or

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT
its sounds really trite, but I can't think of how it could possibly be written any other way

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT
exactly like akdjhglrh

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT
even the middle parts sound ridiculous

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
as far as school stuff goes i basically focused in on french club & peer leadership for a portion of it

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
like that's not what my whole essay is based off of

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
but that's like, displaying

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
OMG THATS THE WORD

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
displaying leadership and whatev

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT
you made sure to emphasize the large role you had in those organizations

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT
and completely ignore your lack of involvement in other areas right?

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT
no

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT
yes

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT
do that

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT
maybe

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT
yes

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT
starts with an i

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT
implied

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT
yes

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT
implies, that i'll be more active in like interact and stuff

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT
that's funny

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT
uninvolved in interact

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 9:57pm EDT
yeah you should mention that being involved hasn't affected your focus on school and blablabla

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 9:57pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:03pm EDT
well not really. well its 528 words

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 10:03pm EDT
well its not like its the one of like 3 things you do

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:03pm EDT
Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, Make the most of yourself, for that is all there is of you. Much of our time in life is spent trying to find ourselves as people and trying to be the best we can be. Reflecting on this quote by Emerson, I have come to the realization that it is never too late to change, improve, and become more involved in what is happening around you. Part of finding yourself involves figuring out what you like doing and what makes you feel a sense of accomplishment. Another part is taking pride in your accomplishments and using that pride to more forward and continue doing what you do best. There are many things about myself, just like anyone else, that can be improved on. But there are also things about myself and things I have done that I take pride in. For example, I am a very punctual individual. I make it a priority to arrive where I need to be on time and to attend meetings that I am expected to attend. Being absent or late would be an aberration, which is also directly reflected in my high school records as I have perfect attendance. Aside from my punctuality, I am a trustworthy, honest person and am respectful to those around me. One of my downfalls, however, is that sometimes it takes me a while to actually become consistently involved in things. This is likely due to the fact that I am a naturally quiet person who listens and observes a lot more often. This is something I have been gradually working on and have been applying it to the clubs and activities that I participate in. I am capable of displaying leadership as shown in the clubs I am involved in and the community service I do outside of school. The more i enjoy something, the more likely I am to participate. This is particularly shown in my I have been a member of the French Club all of high school and became an active member during my sophomore year, doing things such as door decorating and the Trick-or-Treat at High School East for Halloween as well as helping to organize the Coffee Shop held every Spring, only to name a few. I came into my senior year with the intention of running for a position in office for French Club, however it was not possible for me to do so. Being involved has not had a negative affect on the focus I have on my school work. I have maintained honor roll Another one of my goals for this year is to continue being involved in the things I am now as well as become involved in new things. . . . because I am a reliable and responsible person who has come to enjoy participating in school activities and can do what is expected of me. Becoming a member of NHS will help me not only become even more involved in school (aside from classes) but enable me to put everything I have personally learned to additional use as well as help my peers and give back to my community.

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT
i changed the 4 from last year to a 3.

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:24pm EDT
Being involved has not had a negative affect on the focus I have on my school work, either. I have maintained honor roll throughout my entire education and have received an award for Academic Excellence in each of my years here at High School East. WOOOOOOMP

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 10:25pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 10:25pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
itd be affect if i said it hasn't negatively affected my focus on school itself

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
thats the entire paragraph?

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
yeah it's right after when i talk about how involved i am in peer leadership and french club

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
well the essay is only supposed to be 250 words

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
minimum changes things

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
527 so far

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
time to ramble

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
was it "Arrogance is like confidence but better." cause i feel like it was.

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
sounds like something i'd say

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
"Hogwarts looks evil but it teaches kids to be good, and Villandry looks lovely and sweet but it teaches people to be Namekian Shinigami Death Eaters. Pwned." "Professional mather at your service: Doing math like no problem." "What time is it?" '8:41.' "Really..?" *silence* "Oh.. It's not summertime..?.."

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
yesss

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
still cant think of a sentence for that last paragraph

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
Another one of my goals for this year is to continue being involved in the things I am now as well as become involved in new things. ___________ because I am a reliable and responsible person who has come to enjoy participating in school activities and can do what is expected of me. Becoming a member of NHS will help me not only become even more involved in school (aside from classes) but enable me to put everything I have personally learned to additional use as well as help my peers and give back to my community. ~

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
"I am sure that NHS would be a great organiztion for me to join..."

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
excelllent

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
you are wonderful

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
it also makes it seem like you are doing them a fovour by joining them

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
this punctuality paragraph is bothering me

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
i have a problem

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
with saying what i want to say

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
with projecting my thoughts

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
outside of my head

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
to anywhere

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
There are many things about myself, just like anyone else, that can be improved on but there are also things about myself and things I have done that I take pride in. For example, I am a very punctual individual. I make it a priority to arrive where I need to be on time and to attend meetings that I am expected to attend. Being absent or late would be an aberration, which is also directly displayed in my high school records as I have perfect attendance. Aside from my punctuality, I am a trustworthy, honest person and I am respectful to those around me. see how that ends like that. the first thing that pops into my head is a teacher saying "HOW are you this this and this?"

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 10:44pm EDT
the best way is to provide an example

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 10:45pm EDT
maybe a short anectdote

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:45pm EDT
usually. not that i can think of one

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:45pm EDT
which is bad

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:45pm EDT
555 words haha

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 10:45pm EDT
maybe a bit

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
well i mean. being respectful i feel like that goes without saying

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
obviously i'm not interrupting class

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
and being an asshole

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
and fucking shit up

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
cause then i'd get in trouble

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
and that's frowned upon

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
i'm a good kid.

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
its not that frowned upon

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
i mean they have a superlative for it

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
oh?

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
most likely to get in trouble

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
or something like that

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
ooooooooh right

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
well

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
yeah

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
but thats not GETTING in trouble

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
theres a difference

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
anywaaaay

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
i might need to wake up early and finish this

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
bc i still gotta do my lit hw o.O

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:50pm EDT
curse other homework actually

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:50pm EDT
Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, Make the most of yourself, for that is all there is of you. Much of our time in life is spent trying to find ourselves as people and trying to be the best we can be. Reflecting on this quote by Emerson, I have come to the realization that it is never too late to change, improve, and become more involved in what is happening around you. Part of finding yourself involves figuring out what you like doing and what makes you feel a sense of accomplishment. Another part is taking pride in your accomplishments and using that pride to more forward and continue doing what you do best. There are many things about myself, just like anyone else, that can be improved on but there are also things about myself and things I have done that I take pride in. For example, I am a very punctual individual. I make it a priority to arrive where I need to be on time and to attend meetings that I am expected to attend. Being absent or late would be an aberration, which is also directly displayed in my high school records as I have perfect attendance. Aside from my punctuality, I am a trustworthy, honest person and I am respectful to those around me. As shown in the clubs I am involved in and the community service I do outside of school, I am capable of displaying leadership qualities. The more I enjoy something, the more likely I am to participate. This is particularly shown in my involvement in French Club and Peer Leadership. I have been a member of the French Club all throughout high school and became an active member of French Club and Peer Leadership during my sophomore year. I have participated in activities such as door decorating for Halloween, Trick-or-Treat at High School East, organization of the Coffee Shop held every Spring, painting for French International week, and the Harbor House Clean Up, to name a few. Volunteering for these activities has been fun each year and I plan to continue to do them this year. I also came into my senior year with the intention of running for a position in office for French Club, however it was not possible for me to do so. Being involved has not had a negative effect on the focus I have on my school work, either. I have maintained honor roll throughout my entire education and have received an award for Academic Excellence in each of my years here at High School East, which I hope to do the same this year. Another one of my goals for my senior year is to continue being involved in the things I am now as well as become involved in new things. Im sure that National Honor Society would be a great organization for me to join because I am a reliable and responsible person who has come to enjoy participating in school activities and can do what is expected of me. Becoming a member of National Honor Society will help me not only become even more involved in school (aside from classes) but enable me to put everything I have personally learned to additional use as well as help my peers and give back to my community. That's my essay.

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
erase the parenthesis and whats inside

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
cause earlier i kind of did

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
" Being absent or late would be an aberration, which is also directly displayed in my high school records as I have perfect attendance." I love that sentence

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
i hope that wasn't sarcastic

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
no

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
i just love how prideful it is

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
like you dare assume i would associate myself with peasants that would arrive tardy??!

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
Ahaha

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:02pm EDT

This paragraphs has the most awkward feeling about it for me

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT
Meeee too

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT
but i need to finish my outro paragraph then i will go over it

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT
It's messy

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT
Jk

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT
Kk *

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:04pm EDT
I like how I see the word year three times right next to each other

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:04pm EDT
yeah thats never good

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:05pm EDT
i am always annoyed and how hung up i get over the composition of these things as if it was being graded as opposed to being concerned over the content since it is more going to be used to judge me

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:05pm EDT
but i feel like making sure it has good composition will show that i am a good student

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
thats what i was going to say

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
in response lol

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
it'll sound better anyway

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
yeah

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
and make it seem like you are smart enough to actually be in there

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:07pm EDT
yeah, here while your doing whatever, you can find obvious errors in my two body paragraphs

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:07pm EDT
i don;t have intro or outro yet

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:07pm EDT
I also came into my senior year with the intention of running for a position in office for French Club, however it was not possible for me to do so. this sentence feels random wherever i place it. h8 lyf3.

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:07pm EDT
whyyyy

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:07pm EDT
welll the intro should be easy

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:07pm EDT
i feel like the intro's easier to do

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:07pm EDT
I try to discover all the things East has to offer. I know there are dozens of clubs and activities happening all the time, which could either need help or just want people to attend their events. I go to as many of these activities as possible, and assist them with whatever they need. Although it is impossible to go to all the clubs I want since there are only so many days in the week, I still am able to be a regular member of many organizations like Junior Statesmen of America, Strategy club, and Math League. I have much more active roles in Ping Pong, and Juggling club as well. I created the Juggling club because I love to juggle and really want to teach as many people as possible how to juggle, because it is such a simple and interesting talent to have. The more serious activities I am involved with include being part of the Chess Team and a member of the Color Guard, both of which can take over 10 hours every week. I like helping people do things. I almost always do better work on a project when I am helping someone else as opposed to doing my own work. I enjoy volunteer events for my church, or the library, at school, pretty much anywhere possible. At the library I often attend events and occasionally volunteer, but one of the best ways I have been able to find ways to volunteer is the youth group I have been a part of since I moved to Toms River in 2nd grade. I have received dozens of opportunities to volunteer from being a part of youth group. Ive helped serve food at soup kitchens, and take care of children at Vacation Bible School. At school I just make it a priority to attend any events such as blood drives or helping with the Junior prom.

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:07pm EDT
your right about the intro

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:08pm EDT
and i really need to work on transitions

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:08pm EDT
i just noticed the lack of one between these two

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:09pm EDT
yeah i was gonna say there's such a jump between paragraphs

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:09pm EDT
I enjoy volunteer events for my church, or the library, at school, pretty much anywhere possible. i don't like this sentence.

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:09pm EDT
neither do i, i've been jumping all over the place in this essay so there is very little flow

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:10pm EDT
At school I just make it a priority to attend any events such as blood drives or helping with the Junior prom. i'd take out Junior. just because it seems so specific. you say attend events, so you can just say prom. or school dances or something

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
I enjoy volunteering for events at my church, library, school, or anywhere possible. idk. i don't like anywhere possible.

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
what a generic word for prom?

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
dances?

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:12pm EDT
.. prom. or like i said school dances. dances yeah

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:12pm EDT
cause theres winter formal, homecoming, junior, and senior prom

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:12pm EDT
most of which i do Something for

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:12pm EDT
if not much

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:12pm EDT
not that i will mention that

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
Volunteering for these activities has been fun each time and I plan to continue to do them this year. I also came into my senior year with the intention of running for a position in office for French Club; unfortunately it was not possible for me to do so due to the absence of ____ should i mention her name? due to the absence of the advisor...

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
current absence, even. idk.

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
say an advisor

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
not the advisor

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:16pm EDT
and include something about tring to keep the club/activity/ whatever up and running even with their lack of presence

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:16pm EDT
well she is *the* advisor really. without mme doulong, our school's only french teacher, there is no french club cause i don't believe the lady took that over..

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:16pm EDT
but okay

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:16pm EDT
i could mention like, later year stuff?

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:16pm EDT
yeah i knwo its *the* advisor which is why it seems like your blaming her specifically

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
cause i mean she IS going to be back. she's just got a child. but imean we still have the coffee shop maybe

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
feels the same as mentioning her name

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
true

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
i can mention that? hoping to continue other french club events later on in the year upon her return or something

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
metion your plans for later in the year yeah

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
However, I do plan to [try to] continue French Club events later in the year upon the advisors return.

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
good enough

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
try to is in brackets cause idk if i should leave it in or take itout

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
might as well mention her name though if your using it like that

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
don;t say try

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
there is no try

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
only do

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
or do not

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
:D

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
i'm actually more determined to

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
cause i will be pissed if i can't

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
the ONE YEAR i can actually run shit

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
like officially can

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
and she;s gone

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
and she isn't here

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
exactly

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
totally steling your quote intro btw

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
don't live like there's no tomorrow, that's stupid, but live your life like it's a story you want to tell someone else.

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
without the "that's stupid part"

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
upon HER return? their return? i cant say an, i can say the then right?

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
that sounds good to me!

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
just use her name

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
never

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
you mention her too much not to

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
i'll say her instead.

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
i feel like that's too like.. weird. idk.

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
like that isn't something i should say

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
still got no examples of trustworthiness and honesty and respect. like specific events that stick. i can get away with just leaving it like that i think right? probably not. i feel like this is something that points are going to be taken off of lol

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
idk just keep referring to her as if you had stated her name

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
and the trustworthy thing

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
meh, i don't really know your life, so i can't really list any exaples for you

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
yeah lol well i mean like. obvious things that aren't like.

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
do you know what i mean?

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
like i don't run off telling people things that are personal and that people have no business knowing

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
if someone confides in me with something i'm not gonna be like OH HEY YEAH THIS GIRL...

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
toh!

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
use that part about listenning to other people

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
as your example for the trustworthy honest thing

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
like how you listen to other peoples problems etc

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
and help them out

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
Aside from my punctuality, I am a trustworthy, honest person and I am respectful to those around me. If someone confides in me, I will listen to their problems and try my best to help them out without being judgmental. or i can take out 'without being judgmental'. or I will listen to what they have to say or Should someone confide in me, I will listen to what they have to say and do my best to help them without being judgmental. Should someone confide in me, I will listen to their problems and do my best to help them without being judgmental.

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
you don't need the aside from punctuality part

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
but i guess you do

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
as a transition

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
it just seem repetitious

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:30pm EDT
you still need to delete "i am" before respectful

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:30pm EDT
check

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:30pm EDT
aside from this?

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:30pm EDT
and yeah the judgmental part is supercilious as well

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:31pm EDT
i hate saying that though

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:31pm EDT
yeah i am terrible with creating transitions

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:31pm EDT
i do need the I am in there

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:31pm EDT
i am awesome and respect others

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
i am awesome and i am respectuful

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
I am a __ __ PERSON, and respectful to those

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
if i took out the whatever person,

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
it'd be i am a respectful to those around me

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
yeah that might be even better

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
to just delete the first part and say i am respectful

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
i can just say

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
trustworthy and respectful though

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
i mean

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
cause confiding , trustworthy

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
honest has nothing to do with the next sentence

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:34pm EDT
changes to those things have been made

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:34pm EDT
i think i'm done..

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:34pm EDT
i mean it sounds ok

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:34pm EDT
i guess

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:35pm EDT
awesome

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:35pm EDT
does it? i feel like not even mentioning outside school stuff

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:35pm EDT
like

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:35pm EDT
is not good

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:35pm EDT
library stuff?

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:35pm EDT
yeah and my moms worrk~

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:36pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:36pm EDT
like i mention i DO outside school stuff

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:36pm EDT
and its written on the application pages

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:36pm EDT
be dont elaborate

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:36pm EDT
but*

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:37pm EDT
idk where i can add in library stuff

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:38pm EDT
This is particularly shown in my involvement in French Club and Peer Leadership and the Ocean County Library .......... blahblahblah sail is cool yo bye

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:38pm EDT
deleting the and between french and peer leadership

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:39pm EDT
the ocean county library first, so it ends with school stuff

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:39pm EDT
akdjghrh

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:39pm EDT
I'd try not listing them

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:39pm EDT
just have seperate sentences explaining each

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:40pm EDT
unlike what i did

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:40pm EDT
i guess but it seems like it just jumps into that then

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:40pm EDT
which was list them

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:40pm EDT
the reason i jus listed them

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:40pm EDT
transitions are hardf

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:40pm EDT
The more I enjoy something, the more likely I am to actively participate in it. This is particularly shown in my involvement in French Club and Peer Leadership. I have been a member of the French Club all throughout high school and blahblahblah if i delete that once sentence

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:40pm EDT
this is particularly shown in my involvement

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT
i dont even wanna mention the library

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT
that is a good sentence to delete

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT
why not?

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT
but i feel like i need to

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT
volunteer stuff is important

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT
yeah

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT
so start with the library? then school stuff

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT
cause then it continues with school stuff

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT
probably

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
go from aight stuff, to weak middle, the strongest stuff last

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
thats the format i usually use

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
people never pay attention to the middle anyway

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
what does sail stand for again

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
Service and Achievement in the Library

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:43pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:44pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:46pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:47pm EDT
For the past two summers I have volunteered at the Ocean County Library as a member of S.A.I.L (Service and Achievement in the Library) where I mainly shelved books, looked for books that belonged to other library branches, and helped out with various events. ~

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:47pm EDT
something along those lines

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:48pm EDT
explain more about the events and less about the labor

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:48pm EDT
since NHS is about events

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:48pm EDT
hmm

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:48pm EDT
book fest is tab

Nick Devlin October 18, 2011 at 11:48pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 18, 2011 at 11:51pm EDT
For the past two summers I have volunteered at the Ocean County Library as a member of S.A.I.L (Service and Achievement in the Library) where I mainly shelved books, looked for books that belonged to other library branches, and helped out with various events including Bookfest, the S.A.I.L. parties, and puppet shows for kids.

Don't live like there's no tomorrow. Live your life like it's a story you want to tell someone else. This advice from Philip DeFranco one of my favorite quotations because it describes perfectly how I feel life should be lived. I do not want to throw my life away just to feel a rush of excitement, but I want to be able to say Ive done something with my life if ever asked to describe myself. One of the best ways to describe someone is to tell a story about them, and if there is no story to tell, then there is not much to know about that person. I do not want to be a person without a story, I want to be able to say I made an impact and have affected things around me.

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:01am EDT
im tempted to add in

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:01am EDT
I apply these traits of mine when I am volunteering because no one remembers the lazy person who is rude to everyone and can not be trusted with simple responsibilities.

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:01am EDT
after that stuff about how great i am

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:02am EDT
yeah probly not the best idea to say that

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:02am EDT
probably not lol

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:03am EDT
but i feel like i should say something like that to tie it all together

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:03am EDT
that paragraph

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:06am EDT
Just as I apply these traits to everyday occurrences, I apply them when volunteering. cause im cool

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:06am EDT
that'd be awesome

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:06am EDT

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:08am EDT
meh. then i'll have; Just as I apply these traits to everyday occurrences, I apply them when volunteering. As shown in the clubs I am involved in and the community service I do outside of school, I am also capable of displaying leadership qualities.

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:08am EDT

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:13am EDT
skdhjlskh

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:13am EDT
h8 this

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:13am EDT
so much

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:13am EDT
Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, Make the most of yourself, for that is all there is of you. Much of our time in life is spent trying to find ourselves as people and trying to be the best we can be. Reflecting on this quote by Emerson, I have come to the realization that it is never too late to change, improve, and become more involved in what is happening around you. Part of finding yourself involves figuring out what you like doing and what makes you feel a sense of accomplishment. Another part is taking pride in your accomplishments and using that pride to more forward and continue doing what you do best. There are many things about myself, just like everyone else, that can be improved on, but there are also things about myself and things I have done that I take pride in. For example, I am a very punctual individual. I make it a priority to arrive on time and to attend meetings that I am expected to attend. Being absent or late would be an aberration, which is also directly displayed in my high school records as I have perfect attendance. Aside from my punctuality, I am a trustworthy person and I am respectful to those around me. Should someone confide in me, I will listen to their problems and try my best to help them without being judgmental. As shown in the clubs I am involved in and the community service I do outside of school, I am also capable of displaying leadership qualities. The more I enjoy something, the more likely I am to actively participate in it. For the past two summers I have volunteered at the Ocean County Library as a member of S.A.I.L (Service and Achievement in the Library) where I mainly shelved books, looked for books that belonged to other library branches, and helped out with various events including Bookfest, the S.A.I.L parties, and puppet shows for kids. In school, I have been a member of the French Club since freshman year and became an active member of French Club and Peer Leadership during my sophomore year. I have participated in activities such as door decorating for Halloween, Trick-or-Treat at High School East, organization of the Coffee Shop held every Spring, painting for French International week, and the Harbor House Clean Up, to name a few. Volunteering for these activities has been fun each time and I plan to continue to do them. I also came into my senior year with a goal of running for a position in office for French Club; unfortunately it was not possible for me to do so due to the absence of an advisor. However, I do plan to continue French Club events during the rest of the year upon her return. Being involved has not had a negative effect on the focus I have on my school work, either. I have maintained honor roll throughout my entire education and have received an award for Academic Excellence in each of my years here at High School East, which I hope to do again this year. If anything, being involved helps me continue to do well in school because it makes me even more determined to get things done and get them done correctly. Another one of my goals for my senior year is to continue being involved in the things I am now as well as become involved in new things. I am sure that National Honor Society would be a great organization for me to join because I am a reliable and responsible person who has come to enjoy participating in school activities and can do what is expected of me. Becoming a member of National Honor Society will help me not only become even more involved in school but enable me to put everything I have learned to additional use as well as help my peers and give back to my community. thats it, final draft

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:14am EDT
its written in english

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:14am EDT
don't even care.

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:14am EDT

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:14am EDT

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:14am EDT
and yes

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:14am EDT

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:14am EDT

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:15am EDT
excellent

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:15am EDT
it seems to be worgkin

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:15am EDT
yep done

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:16am EDT
awesome

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:16am EDT
My mom was bugging out as I was writing it before

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:16am EDT
All done. Not gonna have a teacher look at it. Make sure you know what to write. Blahblahblah

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:16am EDT
Mom I don't even care if I get in at this point

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:17am EDT
But I'd like to think this essay is better than the first

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:17am EDT
Time to do lit, fml

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:17am EDT
ugh have fun, I'm gonna be doing homework in all my classes tomorrow

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:17am EDT
Wait.

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:18am EDT
doing

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:18am EDT
You know what, whatever. This better be allowed to be over 250 words.

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:18am EDT
250 words is like a paragraph

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:18am EDT
I'll triple check

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:19am EDT
it says approximately

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:19am EDT
250

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:19am EDT
mine's not even done and its already almost 500

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:19am EDT
ughh

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:19am EDT
Doesn't that mean it should really be about 250 words

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:20am EDT
yep

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:20am EDT
fml

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:20am EDT
So basically

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:20am EDT
I can just

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:20am EDT
i might just delete my intro

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:20am EDT
Kill myself

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:20am EDT
I can delete the middle stuff?

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:20am EDT
i was thinking delete every other word in your essay

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:20am EDT
just cause it'd be funny

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:21am EDT
and i'd recommend deleting intro or outro

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:21am EDT
cause the bodies explain why you are awesome

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:21am EDT
as opposed to just being intros and outros

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:21am EDT
72 words intro

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:21am EDT
With the quote

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
I still like the quote. What if I start with that but then jump to

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
you might just only want to include your activites and not the personal stuff?

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
Maybe

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
But that's like half the application

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
or just make a shitty everything deleted copy and ask if it is alright to be way over the limit

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
or if it needs to be shortened

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:23am EDT
I'm keeping this one

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:23am EDT
if it has to be 250 give her the edited one

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:23am EDT
But yeah printing out a second

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:23am EDT
that is less good

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:23am EDT
Way shorter version

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:23am EDT
Yep

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:23am EDT
I'm def taking out the paragraph before the final one

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:23am EDT
plan made

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:23am EDT
How it hasn't affected my school work

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:23am EDT
Bc that's obvious

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:23am EDT
go do your world lit

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:24am EDT
or ap

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:24am EDT

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:24am EDT

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:24am EDT
funfun

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:24am EDT
That's exactly what imma do

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:24am EDT
except fun

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:24am EDT
is a metaphor

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:24am EDT
for the epitome of unfun

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:24am EDT
For the most awful time ever

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:24am EDT
heheh

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:24am EDT

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:24am EDT
unfun

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
just take away the f

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
to use for something else

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
i could think of one or two other purposes for it right now

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
Fuck this shit

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
that being a main one

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
An ESSAY. She should have written write a paragraph

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:26am EDT
i agree

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:26am EDT
250 words is not an ~essay. I can't say anything in 250 words

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:26am EDT
Well if it has to be that short maybe that's why I got rejected

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:26am EDT
not if its in essay form at least

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:26am EDT
Inability to follow directions

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:26am EDT
that would be ridiculous

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:26am EDT
and highly likely

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:27am EDT
Hangs self

Nick Devlin October 19, 2011 at 12:28am EDT
unfun

Steph Dudak October 19, 2011 at 12:28am EDT

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
that'd be dumb

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
plus doing that it'd be four pages SO

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
make it like 1.25 spaced or something

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
well it's not like an essay

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT

minecraft too

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
would they cont that?

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
cause i mean instead of spending a buncha time doin minecraft stuff, you could do some typography stuff and other cool things

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
lol

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
idk

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
If they did I'd be set

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 8:57pm EDT
well then again, the stuff you make in minecraft.. not all of it is original stuff

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
yeah, but i am translating it into a new medium though, its not like there were schematics for that companion cube, I just used a picture from the game

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
or the pokemon statues

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
yeah

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
but i don't think i could just make a portfolio of that

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 8:59pm EDT
no

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 8:59pm EDT
you can't

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 8:59pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 8:59pm EDT
yeah, I will probably have to mess with prodesktop and make some stuff

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 9:00pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
well the beginning of the tale

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
The crowd cheered as the champions stepped onto the field. A young lady from Beauxbatons and a young man from Durmstrang Stood properly and quietly as everyone sang.

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
to go in that space

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
Not one of them looked ready to yield

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
or something like that

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
add more words to make it flow

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
and make sense

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 9:40pm EDT
hm

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 9:41pm EDT
The crowd cheered as the champions stepped onto the field With looks on their faces showing they were not going to yield. does that sound weird

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 9:41pm EDT
idkidk

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 9:42pm EDT
thats so long

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
with looks on their faces saying they would not yield.

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:11pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:12pm EDT

some of them i don't but i don't feel like fixing em lol

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:13pm EDT
like some don't flow as nicely

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:14pm EDT
The only problem is the flow, which takes real authors like weeks anyway

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:14pm EDT
rhyming can get difficult

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:14pm EDT
but i think it's pretty okay for just putting something down on paper

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:15pm EDT
enough of it flows that the teacher should be fine

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:15pm EDT
Outrages as she was, the Slytherin kept her cool.

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:15pm EDT

she's devious and perfect in everyway and does not stop until she is victorious

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:18pm EDT
~~~

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
clearly

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
well actually lol the slytherin in here isn't exactly vivian

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
but it could be

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
they're just very similar

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
whatever, if you want to be that evil author that torments her creations

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
XD

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
YES

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
i do

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
well at least its fun

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
i think i broke my java

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:22pm EDT
downloading things

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:22pm EDT
D:

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:24pm EDT
its all good i think its just miecraft online thats broken

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:25pm EDT
not cool

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:25pm EDT
ah well, its better that way i suppose

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
The two champions had been tricked into grabbing the portkey While the Slytherin girl watched and laughed evilly. i'm so good. i seriously don't know how to end this.

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
at all

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
evilly has two l's?

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
looks gross

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
yes evilly has two ls

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
it looks lovely

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
i don't like it, but anyway. do you seriously want her to come out winning?

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
how often does the bad guy win

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
all right

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
then just have her smugly walk back to the crowd

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
and everyone being astonished

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
then have a little story about how the two other competitors either ended up living happily ever after together in some hick town

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
LOL

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
or died gruesomely in some death bog of nastiness

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
hmmm

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
both are good

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
i like the last option.

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
there you go

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
because then it's like ~hey i'm a future death eater but you have no proof i did anything

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
yeah i gotta make it seem like she's completely clueless as to what is going on

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
i should make all that the epilogue

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
everyone realizes the other two never came out

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
i mean, people do die in this tournament.

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
but they do come out. their bloody corpses thrown back outside of the maze with the portkey or something

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
that might be a little much

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
a bit

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
talk about morbid

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
just say all that was found was like his scarf or something

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
or a wand

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
something symbolic

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
alright so lets see here

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
wait

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
what if i end that there

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
and then have an ~epilogue of vivian actually talking and summarizing what happened. would that be weird

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
like

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
hm

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
or end it with her coming out with the real cup

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
and everyone bein like awww yeeeah!

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
or like wtf?

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
and THEN the epilogue comes

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
which explains what happens to the other two

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
and vivian's like. yeah they found out shortly after that the other two vanished

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
apparently they died, all they found was their wands

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:36pm EDT
either it could be vivian explaining it

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:36pm EDT
or told as if it's some urban legend

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:36pm EDT
no one ever found out how they died

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:36pm EDT
its said that their ghosts still haunt these very grounds oOoOo~~~

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:36pm EDT
like that

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
oh that sucks. there's like

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
there's a ghost

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
in this

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
like. that's kind of a narrator of all of our prologues

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
like as a third person thing observing the class yk.

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
and he died in the school

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
but he actually went to hogwarts

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:38pm EDT
but he died bc he was like eaten by fluffy or something weird like that. trynna get below the trap door to see what was actually there

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:38pm EDT
but anyway

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:40pm EDT
i feel like she has to reason to have these people basically killed

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:40pm EDT
then again. death eaters don't really need a reason do they

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
well you could have it like malfoy complex character which has him like giving into his family and feeling lost or go with bellatrix lestrange characterization "she's bat shit crazy

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
i'd go for the latter here

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
yeah that's true

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
i feel like i could have her as a mix of the two

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
but then again

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
yeah

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
i keep forgetting the slytherin in the tale isn't vivian so it works fine.

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:44pm EDT
She made her way to the real Tri-Wizard Cup and exited the maze victoriously. The roar of the crowd greeted her happily With cheers coming from every direction blankity blankity blank

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
its fine, the wording is meh, but you got your point across and it rhymes

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
i need one more line

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
after direction

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
so its like BAM. i win. bye.

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
but with a word that rhymes

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
she was so happy it felt if she an--

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
maybe not the best for school

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
ummm

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
idk

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT
x.x

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT
i kinda feel like you should try that and see what happends

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT
oh and i looked this up for you

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT
List all words ending with tion 2587 words found

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
so that's fun

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
affection is the first one that comes to mind buut yeah lol

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
um would it be weird to rhyme them with.. them..

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
well my mind is in the gutter, and dr. suess does that all the time so its fine

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
lawl. this sounds so dumb whatev

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
Shortly after, everyone knew something was awry And the parents in the stands started to cry. The Beauxbatons and Durmstrang champions were forever gone Though not a single trace could be drawn To what had actually happened to them. A wand was what was left from each of them.

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
i'm bad at endings

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
i should just be like YEP so that girl from slytherin wins and everyone else dies but no one figures out it was all part of her plan. the end.

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
A wand was what was left from each of them. A wand was all that was left from them.

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
and yes you should

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
fixed

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
akdjhgrh i can't actually do that -.-

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
i did it

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
wrote a 13 page "scary story" in 8th grade

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
we had to read them out loud

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
and i was like ffffffff

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
oh god

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
so after like page 2

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
i said, "and then the SWAT team came and everyone was saved except the people that died. the end"

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
XD

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
which was irrelevant since it was about people living in sewers after a apocalypse

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
and they were in like europe

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
hahahaha

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
omg lol

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 10:58pm EDT
lol i need to double space this. fuck me.

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
well its not like trees are that important anyway

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
naaah

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
and its not like i'm running outta ink

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
moar blue papers

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
anyway

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
I NEED TO END THIS.

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
luckily this is only 5 pages

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
and not 9

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
lol only~

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
it's three without the double space

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:02pm EDT
i still need that one line after direction omg wtf

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 11:05pm EDT
http://www.morewords.com/ends-with/tion/

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 11:05pm EDT
that should help

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 11:05pm EDT
not really

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
tl;dr

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
lol

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
thanks

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:08pm EDT
i should change that other line

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:08pm EDT
cause the last has to basically say how she had gotten away with it

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 11:10pm EDT
why?

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
She made her way to the real Tri-Wizard Cup and exited the maze victoriously. The roar of the crowd greeted her happily With cheers coming from every direction There had not been a single accusation Of the Slytherin girl having caused these unfortunate events.

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
y/n

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
i see nothing wrong so far

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
awesome

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
Shortly after, everyone figured something was awry And the parents in the stands started to cry. The Beauxbatons and Durmstrang champions were forever gone Though not a single trace could be drawn To what had actually happened to them. A wand was all that was left from them. so thenthere's that

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
looks good

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
and it actually flows

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
should i end it just like that?

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
with nothing else?

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
if you imagine a person saying it, it sounds pretty like. mysterious

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
works for me

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT
i feel like you could expand but there;s really no reason to

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT
yeah i feel like it's odd just leaving it like that

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT
but at the same time not?

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT
i just don't really know how to expand it so it's like ~

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
i'd say just leave it

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
due tomorrow?

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
yep

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
bien sûr

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
just leave it

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
its almost midnight

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
time to write one more paper that'll take only a few minutes because i'm not going to use the common app prompts

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
but the prompt from my drexel app that only requires 250-500 words

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
all i wrote on mine was "I am signing up for any college that gave me a free application so I applied"

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
which I am extremely annoyed bu

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
by

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
i thought it was just a paragraph, not the actual essay

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
and i can't fix, I've emailed and asked

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
i doubt she will mark off for it

Nick Devlin October 23, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
hipefully

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
im telling her she has to accept it

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 23, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
it's either blue ink & helvetica

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:30pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:31pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:31pm EDT

i noticed it at 7:30 or so

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:33pm EDT
but thanks for getting it

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
sure thing

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
hopefully you didn't have anything important in there

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
that you had to look back at

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
i didn't really look

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
meh, just a list of things to do, most I can remember

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
well that's good then

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
i'm guessing your homework won't be keeping you up all night again?

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
i don't have homework tonight? that i know of.

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
which i find really peculiar

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
i mean i could read those pages

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
which i might before i go to bed

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
maybe the universe decided that you worked so much last night that you can rest tonight

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
but probably not. i might just skim it, get the main idea. take some notes on it so i dont have to actually retain the information

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
or something

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
not looking forward to critiquing my one art project tomorrow

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:40pm EDT
not looking foward to tomorrow in general

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:41pm EDT
yeah that too

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:48pm EDT
ah well, I will most likely miss half of it due to memory loss

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:48pm EDT
lack of sleep does that apparently

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:49pm EDT
slightly

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:49pm EDT
i mean

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:49pm EDT
i went into mr dispotos however you spell it, room for tape and came out with paper

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:49pm EDT
so

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:49pm EDT
minor malfunction.

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:50pm EDT
minor

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:50pm EDT
i do that every day

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:50pm EDT
so it can't be that ba-- well, actually if i do it every day that actually sounds very bad

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT
ughghghghgh really want to mock kristyn

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT
i mean her comments just beg for it

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT
must resisr

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT
resist

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
mock her anyway

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
Guys, I really don't care about chess. I only chose it as an example because it is significantly less likely for me to be injured playing chess than it is for me to be injured playing hockey like I was today. That is all.

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
I mean really?

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
That is just too easy

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
I could totally just ramble on about this guy who broke his leg

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
or a fight that broke out

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:53pm EDT
or someone who broke a finger

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:53pm EDT
hahaha

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:53pm EDT
what the heck

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:53pm EDT
where is this from

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:53pm EDT
her status about how much she sucks at hockey

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT
oh

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT
apparently i cant spell today either

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT
spelling is not a priorit on facebook chat i dont think

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT
which is why i constantly am spellchecking the things i write on facebook chat

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:56pm EDT
priority*

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:56pm EDT
see

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:56pm EDT
i didn't even notice you spelled that wrong

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:57pm EDT
neither did till after i wrote it, glad i had some error though, otherwise my joke would have fallen flat

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:57pm EDT
I missed it the first time i looked through what i wrote to find an error to fix

Nick Devlin October 26, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT
and was kind of disappointed, but then i noticed it! and all was good in the world

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT
yaaaaay

Steph Dudak October 26, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 30, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
the town is gathered around waiting to unearth some time capsule

Nick Devlin October 30, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
because supposedly some serial iller hid evidence inside it but they never had proof so they just left it

Nick Devlin October 30, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 30, 2011 at 10:36pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 30, 2011 at 10:36pm EDT
For an experiment

Steph Dudak October 30, 2011 at 10:36pm EDT
Or to develop a weapon of mass destruction

Nick Devlin October 30, 2011 at 10:36pm EDT
short story

Steph Dudak October 30, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
How short

Steph Dudak October 30, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
You can make it short

Steph Dudak October 30, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
He makes the weapon and destroys earth

Nick Devlin October 30, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
like couple of paragraphs short

Steph Dudak October 30, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
The end

Nick Devlin October 30, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 30, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 30, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 30, 2011 at 10:38pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 30, 2011 at 10:38pm EDT
Ok fine earth doesn't need to be destroyed.

Nick Devlin October 30, 2011 at 10:38pm EDT

Nick Devlin November 1, 2011 at 10:12pm EDT

Nick Devlin November 1, 2011 at 10:12pm EDT
it was like a national/ canada wide scholarship

Nick Devlin November 1, 2011 at 10:12pm EDT

Steph Dudak November 1, 2011 at 10:14pm EDT

Steph Dudak November 1, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
Well that's good

Steph Dudak November 1, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
I've yet to start any college stuff

Steph Dudak November 1, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
Well I'm gonna use this essay for my Drexel application

Steph Dudak November 1, 2011 at 10:20pm EDT
Emerson is such a quotable guy.

Nick Devlin November 1, 2011 at 10:20pm EDT
essay?

Steph Dudak November 1, 2011 at 10:20pm EDT
It's awesome.

Nick Devlin November 1, 2011 at 10:20pm EDT
i thought you didn't need one?

Steph Dudak November 1, 2011 at 10:20pm EDT
Well it's a 250-500 word thing

Nick Devlin November 1, 2011 at 10:20pm EDT
yeah I remember,

Nick Devlin November 1, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
mine wan't that good...

Nick Devlin November 1, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
what quote are you using?

Nick Devlin November 1, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
the one you just posted?

Steph Dudak November 1, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
Idk yet lol

Steph Dudak November 1, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
Cause it needs to be relevant but

Steph Dudak November 1, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
Hold on

Steph Dudak November 1, 2011 at 10:25pm EDT
To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. Make the most of yourself, for that is all there is of you. Every wall is a door. All life is an experiment. The more experiments you make, the better. Always do what you are afraid to do. Nobody can bring you peace but yourself. This is just like a few I've accumulated. But in my draft I mean. It's kind of like why I'm interested in studying architecture. Or like how it began. So yeah like why. I never finished my draft. But then again, my draft was just written to hand something in for lit

Steph Dudak November 1, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
I wasn't happy with it lol

Nick Devlin November 1, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
well i don't think i've seen you happy with anything you've ever handed in for lit

Nick Devlin November 1, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
but those quotes are awesome

Steph Dudak November 1, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
Touché. Btw I still didn't get my epic story back. Ahclahf.

Steph Dudak November 1, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
And aren't they!

Steph Dudak November 1, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
I particularly like the first one

Nick Devlin November 1, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
I like 4 & 5

Steph Dudak November 1, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
I wrote these out on paper. And it made me want to do an art project including them somehow.

Nick Devlin November 1, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
but they're all good

Nick Devlin November 1, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
that why I did my project on John green!

Nick Devlin November 1, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
just for the quote

Nick Devlin November 1, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
my two favorites of his are "because nerds like us are allowed to be unironically enthusiastic about stuff Nerds are allowed to love stuff, like jump-up-and-down-in-the-chair-cant-control-yourself love it. Hank, when people call people nerds, mostly what theyre saying is you like stuff. Which is just not a good insult at all. Like, you are too enthusiastic about the miracle of human consciousness." ~ John Green "Maybe our favorite quotations say more about us than about the stories and people we're quoting." ~

Nick Devlin November 1, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
you already saw the first

Steph Dudak November 1, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
I like the second one

Nick Devlin November 1, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
yeah me too

Nick Devlin November 1, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
but i feel like the first applies to me a lot more

Steph Dudak November 1, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
It definitely does. Lol what's kind of ironic is there's a quote by Emerson that's like. I hate quotations, tell me what you know.

Nick Devlin November 1, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
and he's like the most quotable guy ever

Steph Dudak November 1, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
Exactly

Steph Dudak November 1, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
I think I read two of his essays last year. I definitely read one

Steph Dudak November 1, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
On education

Steph Dudak November 1, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
Idk where I was going with that

Nick Devlin November 1, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT

Nick Devlin November 1, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT

Steph Dudak November 1, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
Gotcha

Nick Devlin November 1, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
I wish I could say I thought of that beforehand, but I only know cause I tried to mirror it as soon as i noticed -_-

Steph Dudak November 1, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT

Steph Dudak November 1, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT

Steph Dudak November 1, 2011 at 10:58pm EDT

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 8:54pm EDT
it sounds like it lol

Nick Devlin November 2, 2011 at 8:54pm EDT
its mostly because I just can't remember what work I have to do

Nick Devlin November 2, 2011 at 8:54pm EDT
and am assuming that I have none

Nick Devlin November 2, 2011 at 8:55pm EDT
therefore free time i now possess

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 8:55pm EDT
that's great!

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 8:55pm EDT
i'm pretty sure the only hw i have to do today was my final draft for my college essay

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 8:55pm EDT
which i've yet to write

Nick Devlin November 2, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
well that won't be hard whenever you get around to it

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
probably not

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
i'm just not in the mood to do work

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
when am i tho

Nick Devlin November 2, 2011 at 8:59pm EDT
the getting around to it part will probably be more difficult than actually writing it

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 9:01pm EDT
yes

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 9:01pm EDT
it absolutely will lol

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 9:01pm EDT
i have to type it

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
i was going to hand write it first

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
that way i could just get it done. but i didn't feel like it

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
so here i am

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
wasting my own time lol

Nick Devlin November 2, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
but of course answering 80 questions on mblr

Nick Devlin November 2, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
is no problem

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
102

Nick Devlin November 2, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
same difference

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
it's a purposeful distraction from things i'm supposed to be doing

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 9:03pm EDT
i also wasn't expecting to answer all 102 of those..

Nick Devlin November 2, 2011 at 9:04pm EDT
well i am at 80 now

Nick Devlin November 2, 2011 at 9:05pm EDT
and done

Nick Devlin November 2, 2011 at 9:07pm EDT

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 9:07pm EDT
lmao

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 9:07pm EDT
reading those things is interesting i think

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 9:08pm EDT

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 9:08pm EDT
" "

Nick Devlin November 2, 2011 at 9:08pm EDT

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 9:27pm EDT

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 9:27pm EDT
10 minutes wasted

Nick Devlin November 2, 2011 at 9:27pm EDT
10 minutes you would have wasted some other way probly

Nick Devlin November 2, 2011 at 9:27pm EDT

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
particularly black, red, and sky blue.

Nick Devlin November 2, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 10:39pm EDT
btw

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT
and i was quite amused during some of it. i like how you answer questions lol probably because when i read things you write, i can actually hear you saying them in my head. is that weird? it doesn't really matter.

Nick Devlin November 2, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT
thats just how i write

Nick Devlin November 2, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT
its useful for spoken essays

Nick Devlin November 2, 2011 at 10:45pm EDT
you write how you talk as well i notice now, I just tend to read everything in a dramatic announcing voice

Nick Devlin November 2, 2011 at 10:45pm EDT
cause its more fun that way

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
i like reading boring things like that

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
really dramatically. so they're less boring

Steph Dudak November 2, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
or reading boring things out loud in accents

Nick Devlin November 2, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
yep like that

Nick Devlin November 2, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
except with everythin

Nick Devlin November 2, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 4:08pm EDT
i wish computer design didn't seem so boring

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 4:09pm EDT
and more than like 2 colleges had it as a major

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 4:09pm EDT
thatd be cool

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 4:10pm EDT

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 4:12pm EDT

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 4:12pm EDT
and the ones i do have i can't properly execute

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 4:12pm EDT
i feel like minecraft sort of counts though from the amount of work i put into the projects

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 4:12pm EDT
and i love minecraft because I can execute them

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 4:13pm EDT

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 4:13pm EDT

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 4:13pm EDT

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 4:15pm EDT
i need to practice hands and stuff. i wanted to do a project that included like a persons arm. but the focus would be on their hand because they'd be holding a human heart

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 4:15pm EDT
not so much holding as nearly squeezing it

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 4:15pm EDT
but i wanted to use like patterns in it

yk how i've been doing it. the heart being made of a more delicate design, while the hand and arm made of a more rough design. but as you get to the end of the arm, it gets back to being more delicate. and then the background would be this really crazy design that's like. idek how to describe it. not a mess, but that conveys the idea of a mess in your head. then of course i'd use like reds, purples, blacks, greys, and blues and you'd be able to tell where there's blood on the hand from the heart. generally it's symbolizing someone literally ripping your heart out of your chest. so yk when that happens metaphorically, you're not very happy. that's where the background comes in. everythings all nuts. and the heart would have a delicate design because well it's fragile. the rougher design on the hands would represent that too.. and like. itd also be representative of hurt. but i dunno if i will be able to put this all out onto paper. and with this other thing. like i started another thing but i dunno where i'm going with it. i'll have to send you a picture

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 4:21pm EDT
i kinda just drew it last night. so it's like. this thing that's just there and idk what's gonna happen with it

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
why does the design turn delicate again when you reach the tops of the arms?

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
i understand the arms being rough and the soft heart and the chaotic background just not the "but as you get to the end of the arm, it gets back to being more delicate."

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
it's not going to

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
i changed my mind

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
changed your mind to

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
?

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
nothing

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
ill explain in aminute

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
k

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
more than a minute

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
okay so

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
like

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT
a bit more

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT
you know how like

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT
when people hurt you, it's not really the people you expect? so it's like they seem fine and nice and blahblahblah

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
if you expect the person to hurt you it doesn't really hurt, so yeah

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
it's a more complex idea and if i were to go back in to a delicate kind of pattern, it'd have to be like... a full body thing. but even then it wouldn't be portrayed correctly

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
mmhmmm

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
so i just ignored the idea

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
ignored

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
as if i drew it all up already

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
am going to ignore

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
and now?

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
now what

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
do you have another idea?

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
to fix it?

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
or just scrapped completely

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
no i still wanna go do that whole thing, just the arm and hand will be one thing, it's not gonna go back to some sort of delicate design. it'd look weird.

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
but

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
another thing in doing that

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
isss finding out what the designs on each thing will actually be. like i'll need an

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
um

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
outline

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
of the general thing i suppose

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
did any of that even make sense

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
what direction is the arm coming from?

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
yes

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
sorta

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
sorry not really paying attention to what i'm saying lol

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
but

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
askjhgf

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
i think

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
i'm gonna have the paper horizontal

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
OR

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
i could have it vertical and have it like

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
hold on, i'll show you

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_u6z_TgfI7Ww/TSsLq5DAdoI/AAAAAAAAAPg/rETYoVeg2Hc/s320/green%2Bday.png

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
this positioning?

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
something like that, but not exactly

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
the wrist would be at an angle

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
only ttalking about the direction

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
possibly yeah. if i were to do it vertically

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
having it come down would look odd it think

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
well i mean as opposed to horizontally

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
which would look like?

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:26pm EDT

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:26pm EDT
?

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
no

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
that'd be interesting though

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
i'm not sure

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
try sketching a bunch of them

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
see which one is best

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
i was gonna try to show you what i was thinking

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
but trynna do something like that on the computer

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
is not working lol

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
not that it has to be detailed

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
just use paint

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
i know

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
but there's like

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
i cant even explain it

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:30pm EDT
lololol hold on

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:30pm EDT
holding

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
http://i41.tinypic.com/axudh.png this is a good drawing.... anyway, obviously there'd be fingers. that are like around the heart. but it wouldn't be so straight on

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
i can't really translate it from my head

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
i cna sort of see it

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
the only thing

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
is i haven't really drawn hands. so like that's something else in itself

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:36pm EDT
sounds like you have a lot of hand drawing to practice

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:37pm EDT
i have

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:37pm EDT
a lot of stuff

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:37pm EDT
to do

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:37pm EDT
my artistic ability does not support my imagination.

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:37pm EDT
tumblr

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:37pm EDT
and is this what its sorta like?

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:37pm EDT
http://i551.photobucket.com/albums/ii472/dravarian26/heartthing.png

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:38pm EDT
nope

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:38pm EDT
think of

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:38pm EDT
didn't think so

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:38pm EDT
couldn't explain so i had to draw to ask

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:39pm EDT
thinking of

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:40pm EDT
wait

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:40pm EDT
i needed to screen shot the picture

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT
this is a horrid example

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT
http://i40.tinypic.com/35a5b7m.png thing of this but 1) with one hand 2) turned so the palm is facing you more 3) much much less gentle 4) more angular wrist wise

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
think

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
*

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:43pm EDT
so imagining she is standing on a turntable on the ground

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:44pm EDT
she is revolved so her back is pretty much to the front

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:44pm EDT
then her entire body except arm is removed?

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:44pm EDT
that kind of angle?

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:45pm EDT
or her body of removed the her wrist turns so that the palm is visible

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:45pm EDT
but the arm remains at that angle

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:46pm EDT
wish i just had a fake arm to move around to show

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:47pm EDT
ignore the body completely

Steph Dudak November 4, 2011 at 11:47pm EDT
give me another few minutes

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:49pm EDT
i grant you this time

Nick Devlin November 4, 2011 at 11:49pm EDT
use it well

Steph Dudak November 5, 2011 at 12:02am EDT
http://i43.tinypic.com/24kzjpt.png something similar to this perhaps. not exactly but you get the idea?

Nick Devlin November 5, 2011 at 12:02am EDT
i get the idea

Nick Devlin November 5, 2011 at 12:03am EDT
you should just get a red crumpled paper and turn that in as your project

Steph Dudak November 5, 2011 at 12:03am EDT
XD

Steph Dudak November 5, 2011 at 12:03am EDT
great idea

Nick Devlin November 5, 2011 at 12:10am EDT
i thought so

Nick Devlin November 5, 2011 at 12:17am EDT
so i now understand how you want to general outline to be, now you want the heart delicate, the arm rough, and how are you making the background?

Steph Dudak November 5, 2011 at 12:28am EDT
dunno yet

Steph Dudak November 5, 2011 at 12:28am EDT
it's gonna be some ridiculous thing though

Steph Dudak November 5, 2011 at 12:32am EDT
all crazy lookin and such

Steph Dudak November 5, 2011 at 12:32am EDT
like a maze

Steph Dudak November 5, 2011 at 12:32am EDT
but not really

Nick Devlin November 5, 2011 at 12:34am EDT
lots of lines

Steph Dudak November 5, 2011 at 12:37am EDT
yep

Nick Devlin November 5, 2011 at 12:37am EDT

Steph Dudak November 5, 2011 at 12:54am EDT
i also dislike people that all they do is complain about their problems with their insignificant other

Steph Dudak November 5, 2011 at 12:55am EDT

mornight!

Steph Dudak November 5, 2011 at 3:54pm EDT
you're not here again BUT. http://i44.tinypic.com/15ziko9.png this was the other art project idea. the second half i think would look better the way it's going. like have that shape a face instead of having random ones all over. anyway it's just a quick thing, and it's not really proportional. but even the final one if and when i do it, the features will be exaggerated purposely since i can't draw people normally. AND YOU SEE THE ONE LITTLE DROPLET COLORED: http://i42.tinypic.com/16kdi7s.png FUCK YES I AM SO EXCITED AND HAPPY.

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 1:06am EST
yes

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 1:06am EST
this is awesome

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 1:06am EST
the only problem

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 1:06am EST
is that you spelled coloured wrong :P

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 10:19am EST
Yaaay thanks lol & oh wah. I redrew this horizontally. Well I drew the eyes. This is proving to be a pain in the ass. I'll make it work somehow

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 12:17pm EST
well at least you know its a good idea now

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 12:18pm EST
otherwise you wouldn't have gone through the trouble of making it more awesome

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 12:53pm EST
This is true. I still have so much stuff to do lol wtf

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 12:53pm EST
I'm about to draw my front elevation now asdfghkl

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 1:03pm EST
well that sounds super exciting, I think I have to write a couple programs, but I'll just that tomorrow during Study Hall. oh and that Dr. Suess research paper, which I am still ignoring.

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 1:03pm EST

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 1:11pm EST
Yep

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 1:11pm EST

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:35pm EST

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:36pm EST

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:36pm EST

Alas, the answer to that I do not have.

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:38pm EST

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:39pm EST

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:39pm EST
I think i have that cake one copied down somewhere

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:40pm EST
i kind of feel like if I gave our conversations to a college acceptance person they'd totally let us in

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:40pm EST
i mean instead of drugs and reality shows and shit

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:40pm EST

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:42pm EST

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:42pm EST

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:42pm EST

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:47pm EST

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:47pm EST
cause we've made plans for her to come down here like twice already over the summer before this but she wasn't able to

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:47pm EST
and slit your wrists and hang yourself?

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:47pm EST
and i haven't seen her in two years

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:47pm EST
YES

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:47pm EST
in an underwater cage

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:47pm EST
its a good thing your so goffik or you'd be dead by now

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:47pm EST
the cage would be filled with water

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:47pm EST
can you drown while trying to hang yourself?

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
doubtful

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
i guess you'd have to inhale a bunch of water at once and then hang yourself

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
you'd need some messed up gravity

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
or have a globe of water on your head

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
yeah

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
hehe

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
YEAH

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
hanging by fishbowl

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
skdhjkdh

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
well no

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
i kind of want to ......

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
you might get sent to a therapist

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
is that weird

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
do it anyway

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
there's a lot of things like that i wanna draw

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:49pm EST
but

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:49pm EST
no since I already started

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:49pm EST
i can't draw people

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:49pm EST
i wanted to do some sort of thing with someone like ripping out their insides. i'm not too familiar with human anatomy though. i should do an independent study or something.

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:49pm EST
and then learn how to draw all that stuff

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:49pm EST
and then just draw the most wretched weird things you'd ever see

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:49pm EST
i'd probably get sent to a therapist

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:50pm EST
my mother would question my sanity

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:50pm EST
make a 30 day challenge for yourself on tumblr

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:50pm EST
a human pose a day

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:50pm EST
best way I know to get something done

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:50pm EST
mom always asks what i'm drawing. "Hey what are you drawing?" "a girl hanging herself while slitting her wrists with a fish bowl on her head full of water in an attempt to drown herself through all of this."

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:50pm EST
that'd go over well..

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:51pm EST
why wouldn't it?

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:51pm EST
right? who doesn't think of things like that?

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:51pm EST
she asked me yesterday what i was drawing

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:51pm EST
i think i said i don't know

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:51pm EST
cause i didn't feel like explaining it was a person basically made out of her own tears.

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:52pm EST
yeah she might get a bit suspicious at that

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:52pm EST
a little bit

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:52pm EST
WHY ARE YOU DEPRESSED WHY ARE YOU SAD WHY ARE YOU DRAWING *THAT*

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:52pm EST
etc

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:52pm EST
etc

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:53pm EST
oh but imagine if i was drawing that other thing

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:53pm EST
askjhjkfhgf

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:53pm EST
that's why i don't draw downstairs on a desk

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:53pm EST
just say its ironic

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:53pm EST
cause then they ask questions

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 8:53pm EST
and questions are annoying

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:53pm EST
and i'm like uh yeah. i was not happy so i did this. WHY WERENT YOU HAPPY OMG WUT R U OK

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 8:53pm EST

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:07pm EST
that google doesn;t know EVERYTHING

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:08pm EST

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:15pm EST
stupid NJIT. i can't pick my better scores. i need to write down like a single test scored

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:16pm EST
score*

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:16pm EST
of course that'll be the last one i took. but that one was also the one i got the lowest score in the math section on

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:16pm EST
which is an important section for your major

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:16pm EST
the most important i think actually

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:16pm EST
oh well

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:16pm EST
more important than being able to correct sentences

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:17pm EST
and read passages

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:17pm EST
no clue why those are so heavily considered

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:17pm EST
i'm good at math though!! ;___; . i just need time sometimes..

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:17pm EST
it makes me mad. i went down in math every time i took that thing

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:17pm EST
i think the first time i got a 600, then a 560, then a 540. or something like that. like wtf.

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:18pm EST
maybe taking pre-calc or whatever you took this year is actually lowering yuor intelligence

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:18pm EST
oh wait

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:18pm EST
lol

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:18pm EST

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:18pm EST
600, 570, 560

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:18pm EST

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:19pm EST

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:19pm EST

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:19pm EST
reading; 530, 520, 600

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:19pm EST
lolol

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:19pm EST

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:19pm EST
it decreases in order

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:19pm EST
and writing. 550, 580, 610

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:19pm EST
well at least those two went up

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:20pm EST
tthe reading by a ton

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:20pm EST
which was weird

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:20pm EST
i'm not complaining

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:20pm EST
but it's not like i did anything between tests

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:20pm EST
idk. so 1810, together. 1770, the last test i took. which isn't fantastic but it doesn't suck

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:21pm EST
completely.

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:21pm EST
not at all

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:21pm EST
when compared to average of people

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:21pm EST
which is depressingly low

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:21pm EST
yeah which is a lot less than that lol

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:21pm EST
and ik people who've gotten less than the average

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:21pm EST
i don't associate myself with people like that

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:21pm EST
jk

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:22pm EST
i know like 10

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:22pm EST
lmao

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:22pm EST
what the best you can get in a section?

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:22pm EST
800?

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:22pm EST
yeah

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:23pm EST
so if you get 800 in all three, you're perfect

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:24pm EST
.02% a year get perfect

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:24pm EST
o.O

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:24pm EST
like 300 kids in the country

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:24pm EST
jeez

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:25pm EST
yeah i'm surprised i scored how i did. 2400 is nuts.

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:25pm EST
awesome for them of course

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:26pm EST
i kind of feel like i should try and get it

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:26pm EST
You have a limited amt of time. Register nov 8th for the dec 3rd sat to avoid late fees

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:27pm EST

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:28pm EST
the only problem i hve is math

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:29pm EST
Writing is worse than math it seems. I feel like I could do great on math if I didn't have to rush so much

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:29pm EST
Like you just have to know it

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:29pm EST
well i don't have math this year

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:29pm EST
I left quite a few blank I think

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:30pm EST
Like at the math league thing I couldn't even begin to guess how to answer

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:30pm EST
usually i'm fine

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:30pm EST
but this year i was like .... fffff

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:31pm EST
Lololol math league

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:31pm EST
Omg

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:31pm EST
I couldn't even like

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:31pm EST
I think I was able to actually answer one

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:31pm EST
Maybe two

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:31pm EST
Maybe

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:32pm EST
i understand 4or 5

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:32pm EST

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:32pm EST

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:32pm EST
Gotta stay after for that again in Tuesday.

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:32pm EST

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:32pm EST

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:32pm EST
yeah this tuesday

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:32pm EST
One of the last ones

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:32pm EST
My answer actually made sense.

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:33pm EST
I never learned permutations

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:33pm EST
Not that that's exactly relevant. But just felt like sharing. Fen went over it for literally five minutes

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:34pm EST
yeahh

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:34pm EST
5!

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:34pm EST

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:34pm EST
Yeah

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:34pm EST
I understood those fine

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
Idek where that button is on my calculator

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
i never used the butotn on the calculator

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
Just kidding

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
i usually typed it out

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
I know where it is

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
easier to comprehend

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:36pm EST
I think i understand why i didn't do well in writing

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:36pm EST
I am taking a practice test now

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:36pm EST
fuckin colons

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:39pm EST
Correcting the sentence stuff is fun

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:39pm EST
i think so, I hate when i make stupid errors though

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:44pm EST
Yeah generally that kinda sucks

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:45pm EST
Kinda like when you misplace the only pencil you have wtf

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:45pm EST
which is why i stockpile pencils that i steal from desks that people leave

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
It should be on my bed though

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
Then again my bed is a mess

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:46pm EST

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:49pm EST
How'd you manage to do that

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:49pm EST
add an extra 0

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:49pm EST
when your defining the radius

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:50pm EST
of a sphere

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:50pm EST
tends to overload things a bit

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:51pm EST

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:51pm EST
Do you have a hole puncher?

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:51pm EST

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:52pm EST
Like something you could bring to school and let me use during lunch to put holes in some of my world affairs notes

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:52pm EST
yep

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:53pm EST
Yaaaay! I have a test Tuesday and I greatly underestimated the information I have to know

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:54pm EST
Looks like I'll be cramming massively tomorrow night

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:54pm EST
I better not get any actual homework that'll take me a million years to do

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:54pm EST
...art. And architecture. Well.

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:54pm EST
Shit.

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:55pm EST
i feel like one day i wll regret not having taken a schedule like yours

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:55pm EST
not today though

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:56pm EST
Definitely not today

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:57pm EST
Because today I want to cry in a corner. Time to make myself a schedule

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:57pm EST
Okay

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 9:57pm EST
Let's see.

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 9:58pm EST
looking

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 10:01pm EST
I can stay up for another hour. I gotta work on my art project. I only have one and I need two by Wednesday. Tomorrow I will go to school. During art I will work on my project. During architecture I will work on my plans. Hopefully getting the front elevation finished and get started on the side. Blahblahblah. During lunch. Eat. And work on my art project. Or go over my physics hw. I didn't answer one so I might have to make Kevin help me. Then imma go home. I'm going to not put on pjs bc then I'll be comfortable and want to sleep. I'll do any actual hw I have first. Then I'll study some physics and do some problems and somehow memorize my derivations. Then I'll study for world affairs. Then I'll have to eat dinner. Then I'll immediately come home. Work on art for a little bit. Study for physics, then study for world affairs. Lots of world affairs studying.

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 10:02pm EST
Tuesday. I'll take both those awful tests. Depending where I'm at in architecture, I might bring home that stuff and finish it. Everything's due Wednesday. Probably do the same thing during lunch Tuesday. Then I gotta stay after for math league. Go home. Eat. Study for pre calc, do actual homework, spend all night doing art projects and maybe architecture stuff

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 10:03pm EST
End up getting no sleep, take a test Wednesday morning, be brain dead for the rest of the day, go home and look forward to the weekend while looking back on the last three days wanting to cry because I handled it poorly

Steph Dudak November 6, 2011 at 10:03pm EST
Sounds good.

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 10:04pm EST

The Brazilian government used Agent Orange to defoliate a large section of the Amazon rainforest so that Alcoa could build the Tucuruí dam to power mining operations.

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 10:20pm EST
those fucking bastards

Nick Devlin November 6, 2011 at 10:21pm EST
"The site, a former waste oil recycling storage facility, accepted waste oil from a number of companies, including Alcoa. The facility was improperly managed and operated and, as a result, soils on the York Oil Property and nearby wetlands sediments and groundwater were contaminated. "

Introduction

Steph Dudak November 7, 2011 at 5:23pm EST
Write the actual body of it then

Nick Devlin November 7, 2011 at 5:23pm EST
the intro explains the article

Nick Devlin November 7, 2011 at 5:24pm EST
this paper has a weird format

Nick Devlin November 7, 2011 at 5:24pm EST
explain article, then critisize the article, then explain the them used for book and article

Nick Devlin November 7, 2011 at 5:24pm EST
then explain book

Nick Devlin November 7, 2011 at 5:24pm EST
I don't know why i am finding this so difficult

Steph Dudak November 7, 2011 at 5:27pm EST
Idk why either o.o

Steph Dudak November 7, 2011 at 5:28pm EST
It's basically just a paper on the book. Almost like an analysis but not so in depth going from what you just said

Nick Devlin November 7, 2011 at 5:28pm EST
pretty much

Nick Devlin November 7, 2011 at 5:28pm EST
we just compare a theme in a book and an article

Steph Dudak November 7, 2011 at 5:30pm EST
Nick

Steph Dudak November 7, 2011 at 5:30pm EST
It's so easy

Steph Dudak November 7, 2011 at 5:30pm EST
You don't even need to think

Steph Dudak November 7, 2011 at 5:30pm EST
Are you thinking? Maybe that's the problem

Steph Dudak November 7, 2011 at 5:30pm EST
Stop thinking. Write. Reread what you wrote and go from there.

Nick Devlin November 7, 2011 at 5:31pm EST
i am always thinking

Nick Devlin November 7, 2011 at 5:31pm EST
just of the wrong things

Nick Devlin November 7, 2011 at 5:31pm EST

Declared 2012 Republican Presidential Candidate Jimmy McMillan The former mayoral, gubernatorial and senatorial candidate for the Rent Is Too Damn High Party announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination on December last year. Explaining his decision not to contest the Democratic nomination, a party he was formerly registered with, karate expert McMillan was quoted as saying "the rent is too damn high." The flamboyant Vietnam veteran also gave some words of advice to President Obama, If you dont do your job right, I am coming at you!"

Nick Devlin November 7, 2011 at 5:59pm EST
Since I've gotten home i've partially written my essay, found an article that actually relates to my topic, rewritten my essay partially to match new article, done work cited, and remembered that i have to rewrite abstract

Nick Devlin November 7, 2011 at 5:59pm EST

Nick Devlin November 7, 2011 at 5:59pm EST

Steph Dudak November 7, 2011 at 6:00pm EST

Steph Dudak November 7, 2011 at 6:00pm EST

Steph Dudak November 7, 2011 at 6:01pm EST

Steph Dudak November 7, 2011 at 6:01pm EST

Nick Devlin November 7, 2011 at 6:35pm EST
can not is considered a syntax error

Nick Devlin November 7, 2011 at 6:35pm EST

Steph Dudak November 7, 2011 at 6:36pm EST

Nick Devlin November 7, 2011 at 6:42pm EST
Article Summary It is common for companies to cut corners concerning safety and environmental when behind on schedule, but the company BP (British Petroleum) had major issues in the Spring of 2010. The Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded due to numerous problems involving the instruments used, and environmental factors such as weather and currents. The Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations scrutinized the spill in order to determine if BP was at fault for the explosion. The investigations showed that despite multiple warnings from personnel regarding the safety issues of their plans, decisions were still made to use unsafe procedures. This led to many ignored malfunctions that eventually led up to the explosion killing 11 crew and releasing an estimated 210,000 gallons of oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico (Saxe). blablabla more stuff about article Critique (of Article) The article gives good details and explanation but is somewhat difficult to understand due to the jargon used along with boring format. It cannot be thoroughly understood prior knowledge of business and oil rig machinery.

Nick Devlin November 7, 2011 at 6:44pm EST
my critique will be expanded upon but i just want to show how little i can get done in 3

Nick Devlin November 7, 2011 at 6:44pm EST
4 hours

Steph Dudak November 7, 2011 at 6:48pm EST
It cannot be thoroughly understood without* prior knowledge of business and oil rig machinery. Is that what you meant? Or an I just not reading it right

Nick Devlin November 7, 2011 at 6:50pm EST

Nick Devlin November 7, 2011 at 6:50pm EST

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 7:35pm EST
Unicorn Unicorn hair generally produces the most consistent magic, and is least subject to fluctuations and blockages. Wands with unicorn cores are generally the most difficult to turn to the Dark Arts. They are the most faithful of all wands, and usually remain strongly attached to their first owner, irrespective of whether he or she was an accomplished witch or wizard. Minor disadvantages of unicorn hair are that they do not make the most powerful wands (although the wand wood may compensate) and that they are prone to melancholy if seriously mishandled, meaning that the hair may 'die' and need replacing. Dragon As a rule, dragon heartstrings produce wands with the most power, and which are capable of the most flamboyant spells. Dragon wands tend to learn more quickly than other types. While they can change allegiance if won from their original master, they always bond strongly with the current owner. The dragon wand tends to be easiest to turn to the Dark Arts, though it will not incline that way of its own accord. It is also the most prone of the three cores to accidents, being somewhat temperamental. Phoenix This is the rarest core type. Phoenix feathers are capable of the greatest range of magic, though they may take longer than either unicorn or dragon cores to reveal this. They show the most initiative, sometimes acting of their own accord, a quality that many witches and wizards dislike. Phoenix feather wands are always the pickiest when it comes to potential owners, for the creature from which they are taken is one of the most independent and detached in the world. These wands are the hardest to tame and to personalise, and their allegiance is usually hard won.

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 7:35pm EST
there we go

Steph Dudak November 9, 2011 at 7:37pm EST
oooo

Steph Dudak November 9, 2011 at 7:37pm EST
well that's pretty cool

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 7:37pm EST
theres entries for type of wood and wand length/flexibility as well

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 7:38pm EST
Cherry This very rare wand wood creates a wand of strange power, most highly prized by the wizarding students of the school of Mahoutokoro in Japan, where those who own cherry wands have special prestige. The Western wand-purchaser should dispel from their minds any notion that the pink blossom of the living tree makes for a frivolous or merely ornamental wand, for cherry wood often makes a wand that possesses truly lethal power, whatever the core, but if teamed with dragon heartstring, the wand ought never to be teamed with a wizard without exceptional self-control and strength of mind.

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 7:38pm EST
she made a description for EVERY type of wood

Steph Dudak November 9, 2011 at 7:38pm EST
O.O

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 7:39pm EST

there ya go

Steph Dudak November 9, 2011 at 8:09pm EST
Where wizards have been buried with wands of yew, the wand generally sprouts into a tree guarding the dead owners grave. What is certain, in my experience, is that the yew wand never chooses either a mediocre or a timid owner.

Steph Dudak November 9, 2011 at 8:09pm EST
that's pretty cool

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:09pm EST
Where wizards have been buried with wands of yew, the wand generally sprouts into a tree guarding the dead owners grave.

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:09pm EST
my favorite part

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:09pm EST
that would be awesome

Steph Dudak November 9, 2011 at 8:11pm EST
A sensitive wand, hazel often reflects its owners emotional state, and works best for a master who understands and can manage their own feelings.

Steph Dudak November 9, 2011 at 8:11pm EST
Others should be very careful handling a hazel wand if its owner has recently lost their temper, or suffered a serious disappointment, because the wand will absorb such energy and discharge it unpredictably.

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:11pm EST
well i lost my emotions a while bac

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:11pm EST
so i'm good

Steph Dudak November 9, 2011 at 8:11pm EST
that's good

Steph Dudak November 9, 2011 at 8:12pm EST
i definitely wouldn't end up with a wand like that

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:12pm EST
can you sign up for pottermore yet?

Steph Dudak November 9, 2011 at 8:12pm EST
no /: cause it's in beta

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:13pm EST
ah well

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:13pm EST
i'll give you all the new info

Steph Dudak November 9, 2011 at 8:13pm EST
i still don't really understand what it is exactly

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:13pm EST
you get a picture from the first scene

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:14pm EST
you find little images in the picture to get info

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:14pm EST
there are little articles that you can click on the side

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:14pm EST
either give excerpts from the book

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:14pm EST
summaries of places or characters

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:14pm EST
or little stories

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:15pm EST
most of it is just copied from the text of the books

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:15pm EST
but there is a lot of new info in some the articles

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:15pm EST
stuff that couldn't be fit into the books

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:15pm EST
like the backstory of petunia and vernon

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:15pm EST
how they got married and everything

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:16pm EST
you just keep going through more and more pictures and look for very obvious little objects in the images to click on

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:16pm EST
occasionally you have to take a quiz or something

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:16pm EST
and it will tell you your wand type

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:16pm EST
and sort you into a house

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:16pm EST
so like at chapter 4 or 5 or whatever when harry gets his wand

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:17pm EST
there is an image of diagon alley

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:17pm EST
you click to get images of school supplies

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:17pm EST
and to get the wand

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:17pm EST
you take a quiz

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:17pm EST
thats pretty simplified i suppose

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:17pm EST
but easiest way i can explain

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:22pm EST
New things like this

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 8:22pm EST
Of the three approved animals permitted to students as pets at Hogwarts, the toad is, and has been for many years now, by far the least popular. Centuries ago, in blood-thirstier times, when young witches and wizards were expected to personally pop out the newt eyes they were using in potions, they routinely brought boxes of toads to school for use in potions and in other charms. Over time, as the Ministry of Magic introduced legislation regarding animal cruelty (sub-sections 13-29 inclusive relate to potion ingredients and their production) such practices were gradually outlawed. The toad, never much appreciated for its own personal appeal, gradually appeared (alive) less and less frequently at Hogwarts, unless hopping and swimming wild in the grounds. By the time Harry arrived at Hogwarts, possession of a pet toad conveyed neither cool nor status; indeed, it was something of an embarrassment. Trevor, Neville's toad, had nothing to commend him except a propensity for getting lost, and when he finally slipped off to join his brethren in the Hogwarts lake, both owner and pet felt a sense of relief.

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 9:06pm EST
now i get to read some letter

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 9:06pm EST
Congratulations! Im Prefect Gemma Farley, and Im delighted to welcome you to SLYTHERIN HOUSE. Our emblem is the serpent, the wisest of creatures; our house colours are emerald green and silver, and our common room lies behind a concealed entrance down in the dungeons. As youll see, its windows look out into the depths of the Hogwarts lake. We often see the giant squid swooshing by  and sometimes more interesting creatures. We like to feel that our hangout has the aura of a mysterious, underwater shipwreck. Now, there are a few things you should know about Slytherin  and a few you should forget. Firstly, lets dispel a few myths. You might have heard rumours about Slytherin house  that were all into the Dark Arts, and will only talk to you if your great-grandfather was a famous wizard, and rubbish like that. Well, you dont want to believe everything you hear from competing houses. Im not denying that weve produced our share of Dark wizards, but so have the other three houses  they just dont like admitting it. And yes, we have traditionally tended to take students who come from long lines of witches and wizards, but nowadays youll find plenty of people in Slytherin house who have at least one Muggle parent. Heres a little-known fact that the other three houses dont bring up much: Merlin was a Slytherin. Yes, Merlin himself, the most famous wizard in history! He learned all he knew in this very house! Do you want to follow in the footsteps of Merlin? Or would you rather sit at the old desk of that illustrious ex-Hufflepuff, Eglantine Puffett, inventor of the Self-Soaping Dishcloth? I didnt think so. But thats enough about what were not. Lets talk about what we are, which is the coolest and edgiest house in this school. We play to win, because we care about the honour and traditions of Slytherin. We also get respect from our fellow students. Yes, some of that respect might be tinged with fear, because of our Dark reputation, but you know what? It can be fun, having a reputation for walking on the wild side. Chuck out a few hints that youve got access to a whole library of curses, and see whether anyone feels like nicking your pencil case. But were not bad people. Were like our emblem, the snake: sleek, powerful, and frequently misunderstood. For instance, we Slytherins look after our own  which is more than you can say for Ravenclaw. Apart from being the biggest bunch of swots you ever met, Ravenclaws are famous for clambering over each other to get good marks, whereas we Slytherins are brothers. The corridors of Hogwarts can throw up surprises for the unwary, and youll be glad youve got the Serpents on your side as you move around the school. As far as were concerned, once youve become a snake, youre one of ours  one of the elite. Because you know what Salazar Slytherin looked for in his chosen students? The seeds of greatness. Youve been chosen by this house because youve got the potential to be great, in the true sense of the word. All right, you might see a couple of people hanging around the common room whom you might not think are destined for anything special. Well, keep that to yourself. If the Sorting Hat put them in here, theres something great about them, and dont you forget it. And talking of people who arent destined for greatness, I havent mentioned the Gryffindors. Now, a lot of people say that Slytherins and Gryffindors represent two sides of the same coin. Personally, I think Gryffindors are nothing more than wannabe Slytherins. Mind you, some people say that Salazar Slytherin and Godric Gryffindor prized the same kinds of students, so perhaps we are more similar than we like to think. But that doesnt mean that we cosy up with Gryffindors. They like beating us only slightly less than we like beating them. A few more things you might need to know: our house ghost is the Bloody Baron. If you get on the right side of him hell sometimes agree to frighten people for you. Just dont ask him how he got bloodstained; he doesnt like it. The password to the common room changes every fortnight. Keep an eye on the noticeboard. Never bring anyone from another house into our common room or tell them our password. No outsider has entered it for more than seven centuries. Well, I think thats all for now. Im sure youll like our dormitories. We sleep in ancient four-posters with green silk hangings, and bedspreads embroidered with silver thread. Medieval tapestries depicting the adventures of famous Slytherins cover the walls, and silver lanterns hang from the ceilings. Youll sleep well; its very soothing, listening to the lake water lapping against the windows at night.

Nick Devlin November 9, 2011 at 9:10pm EST
all that is good that came out of this is that green is my favorite colour

Steph Dudak November 9, 2011 at 9:10pm EST

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:22pm EST
but fantasy isn't a very good tpe for short stories

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 12:23pm EST
make up some sort of weird creature

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 12:24pm EST
that lives somewhere in the sky

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 12:24pm EST
on like an island or something. not just floating up there

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:24pm EST
a floating island?

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 12:24pm EST
sure

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:24pm EST
well you said in the sjy

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:24pm EST
sky*

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 12:25pm EST
yes so it would be implied that the island is floating

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:26pm EST
hmm

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:27pm EST
i'm thinking the creature should already exist in some story

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:27pm EST
but either be obscure enough for me to set my own rules for it

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:27pm EST
or have its rules be rewritten by be to be seen in a different way

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:28pm EST
because inventing a magical creature would take a very long time

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:28pm EST
time to pull out the encyclopias gathering dust on my shelves

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 12:31pm EST
not difficult. just combine existing animals. like in avatar

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 12:31pm EST
the story doesn't need to be about it really

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 12:31pm EST
but it can be included

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:32pm EST
well if I invent my own creature I will become too focuses on the animal and not the story about it

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:33pm EST
I just need a base to work aroun

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:33pm EST
d

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:33pm EST
and I kind of want the story to be based around the creature

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:33pm EST
not as like a character

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:33pm EST
major just as a plot point

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:33pm EST
like finding it or helping it

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 12:33pm EST
have someone go searching for the creature?

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 12:33pm EST
because

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 12:34pm EST
the person's looking for something else

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 12:34pm EST
but needs the creatures help to find it

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 12:34pm EST
idk

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:34pm EST
hmm

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 12:35pm EST
you know how in avatar, aang well. he accidentally finds that lion turtle thing? cause it looks like an island. and he helps him figure out how to defeat the fire lord without actually killing him

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 12:35pm EST
some sort of wise awesome creature

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 12:35pm EST
that's important and overlooked by most people

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:36pm EST
that might work

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:36pm EST
I could probably define everything better if I picked a more specific genre

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:36pm EST
should the style be more mythic

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:36pm EST
or urban fantasy

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:37pm EST
or high fantasy

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:37pm EST
sci fi

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:38pm EST
not high fantasy, too long

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:38pm EST
sci fi I'm not smart enough to write

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:43pm EST
Okay so i want a main character that need to find a magical beast in order to accomplish a goal

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:44pm EST
they need to find the creature

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:44pm EST
to gain knowledge or information of some kind

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 12:50pm EST
thanks for help Steph! talkto ya lter

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 12:50pm EST
No problemo good luck

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 9:42pm EST

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 9:44pm EST

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 9:45pm EST
because i did really poorly on it the first time

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 9:45pm EST
mhmm

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 9:45pm EST
but i didn't even use my notes or anything except for the last question

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 9:45pm EST
and everything was fine. like. i don't understand why i did so bad on it in class. it's the same exact test.

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
so you're really annoyed that you got it all this time but not when you first took it?

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
yes.

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
exactly

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
now you are making sense

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
well i am making sense for you

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
close enough

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
furious really. because i could've gotten a really good grade on it.

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
and yes that is annoying as funk

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
with corrections i'll bring it up to like a C

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
but

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
jesus christ

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 9:53pm EST
would have gotten like an A otherwise?

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 9:53pm EST
yes

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 9:53pm EST
which would've been fantastic

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 9:53pm EST
BUT NO

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 9:53pm EST
I'M DUMB

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 9:54pm EST

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 9:54pm EST

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 9:58pm EST

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 9:59pm EST
i cant draw animals

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 9:59pm EST
thats why you need to do it

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 9:59pm EST

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 9:59pm EST
i dont want to draw animals

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 9:59pm EST
animals are just a shit ton of circles

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 9:59pm EST

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 10:08pm EST

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 10:23pm EST
Ik

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 10:23pm EST
But it's gotta fit my concentration

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 10:24pm EST
i think a murderous rabbit is not what it seems

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 10:36pm EST
maybe

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 10:36pm EST
but i also dunno if that IS my concentration SO therein lies the issue

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 10:36pm EST
well it doesn't matter that much anyway, you should probly draw things you really like every once in a while even if they don realate to your concentration

Nick Devlin November 10, 2011 at 10:37pm EST
otherwise you will hate art as much as i hate programming

Steph Dudak November 10, 2011 at 10:37pm EST

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 7:29pm EST
what is that

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 7:30pm EST
they gave a box of shapes

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 7:30pm EST

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 7:30pm EST
I made a golf scened

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 7:30pm EST
interesting

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 7:30pm EST
excluding the d

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 7:30pm EST
most of the things people made were abstract

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 7:31pm EST
and here you are

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 7:31pm EST
with a literal scene

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 7:31pm EST
as opposed to aesthetic genius

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 7:31pm EST
-shakes head-

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 7:33pm EST
there was like one other guy who made an awesome tree thing

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 7:33pm EST
but most were picture with deeper meaner and an actual message

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 7:34pm EST
meaning*

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 7:34pm EST
like someone who made a piece based on the idea of having ideas

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 7:35pm EST
its a bit on my mind

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 7:35pm EST
thats exactly why you shouldn't create things having to do with it

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 7:35pm EST
that logic kinda makes little sense

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 7:35pm EST
yeah i know

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 7:54pm EST
hopefully a day of rest will not utterly destroy your school work

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 7:55pm EST
oh it will

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 7:55pm EST
i regret nothing

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
good

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
regret is a terrible feeling to have

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
i'm sure

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
i wouldn't know though

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
never felt it?

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 7:57pm EST
nope

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 7:57pm EST
i regret nothing usually applies to my entire life

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 7:57pm EST
that's good

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 7:57pm EST
I've felt it on occasion

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 7:57pm EST
its not fun

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 7:58pm EST
especialy when you know you could still change what you regret doing or not doing

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 7:58pm EST
but you still ignore the problem

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:00pm EST
because i don't want to feel actual feelings of regret i choose not to do it, i think. because that doesn't mix well with the other emotional issues i have. so it's more so going through life with a shit happens attitude. never expecting too much, and realizing that especially if it's in the past, my decisions probably seemed right at the time

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:01pm EST
the rest of my being isn't so selective though

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:02pm EST
yeah, that way of thinking applies to some of my emotions for different reasons, like anger and joy are two big ones I never really use.

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:03pm EST
which are kind of important but meh

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:03pm EST
i can't apply it to any other emotions i have

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:03pm EST
i also can't pretend to be happy when i'm not

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:04pm EST
i kinda wish i could cause then i wouldn't need to worry about people being like wah whats wrong D:<< all the time

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:22pm EST
glad to know you think so much like a pony

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:22pm EST

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:23pm EST
yes

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:23pm EST
exactly

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:26pm EST
i'm so screwed on the math section

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:26pm EST
like you have no idea

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:26pm EST
I can't even remember how people thought I was good at math

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:26pm EST
Here just as proof of my stupidity

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:26pm EST
The projected sales volume of a video game cartridge is given by the function where is the number of cartridges sold, in thousands; is the price per cartridge, in dollars; and is a constant. If according to the projections, cartridges are sold at per cartridge, how many cartridges will be sold at per cartridge?

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:27pm EST
the equation is http://sat.collegeboard.org/mathmlgen/content/question/practiceQuestion/multipleChoice/mathMCq3_1.png

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:27pm EST
my equation that i wrote after filling in the info

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:28pm EST
100,000(10)=3000/2(10)+a

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:29pm EST
is that not right

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:31pm EST
s(p)

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:31pm EST
only means y

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:31pm EST
so i don't put 10 in the parenthesis

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:31pm EST
i'm not really paying attention to the problem

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:31pm EST
oh yeah

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:31pm EST
i know that lol

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:32pm EST
its also given in thouasands so the number is 100 not 100,000

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:32pm EST
this is like 8th grade

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:32pm EST
it took me 10 minutes

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:32pm EST
x.x

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:33pm EST

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:33pm EST
YES

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:33pm EST
mrs dziedzic is a genius

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:33pm EST

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:34pm EST
class=good

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:34pm EST

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:34pm EST
i feel like retarded this year

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:34pm EST
e24

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:35pm EST

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:35pm EST
5th period i want to say

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:35pm EST

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:35pm EST
wait

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:35pm EST
3rd period

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:35pm EST
i don't know actually

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:35pm EST
but she has a lot of classes

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:35pm EST
no not 3rd period

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:35pm EST
idk

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:35pm EST
you should ask her

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:36pm EST
do you think she''l actually let me do it?

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:36pm EST
i've never even spoken to her

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:36pm EST
you can try lol. if you don't have any important classes anyway

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:36pm EST
don't you have a study hall?

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:37pm EST
2nd

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:37pm EST
right now in pre calc we're doing graphic inequalities though

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:38pm EST
boring

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:38pm EST
hate those

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:38pm EST
well

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:38pm EST
i lost my train of thought

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:38pm EST
um

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:38pm EST
yeah i dont even know

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:38pm EST
it's not awful though

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:40pm EST
i just need to remember stuff like

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:40pm EST
the square root of x can be rewritten as x to the power of -1/2

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:40pm EST
so i am able to solve equations

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:41pm EST
you can just like go in an ask her questions i guess. she's in there before school starts

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:41pm EST
i have a pass lol

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:41pm EST
its laminated

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:42pm EST
you must feel special

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:42pm EST
i guess i just need like a tutor

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:42pm EST
but i feel like all i'll be doing is asking stupid questions with answers I could easily look up on google

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:43pm EST
like how to solve equations when absolute value is involved

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:43pm EST
likee?

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:43pm EST
ninja'd

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:43pm EST
...

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:43pm EST
|x+3| = 6 equations like those

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:44pm EST
or |x+3|>6

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:44pm EST
|4x-7|=5 is the one i am on right now

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:44pm EST
equalities not inequalities

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:44pm EST
i remember some about flipping the sign for inequalities though

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:44pm EST
when you multiple by a negative

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:45pm EST
i think

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:45pm EST
idk

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:45pm EST
irrelevant though

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:46pm EST
Divide

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
dammit that was simple as hell

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
multiple other side by -1

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
completely forgot

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:55pm EST
Poor Nicholas

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 8:55pm EST
Should've taken a math this year

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:57pm EST
well i actually enjoy most of my classes

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 8:57pm EST
i think it was worth it

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 9:00pm EST
Let the function f be defined by (some long as equation) and (some other long ass equation), what is one possible value of t?

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 9:00pm EST
I had no clue how to solve

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 9:00pm EST
so i put 1 in the checkbox soit would help me know how to solve

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 9:00pm EST
i was correct

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 9:00pm EST
Lmao

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 9:00pm EST
by guessing 1 in the fill-ins, why doesn't this work on the real SAT's

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 9:01pm EST
Bc actual SATs suck

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 9:02pm EST
agreed

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 9:03pm EST
Yk what's funny?

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 9:04pm EST
I was sick the last time I took my SATs and thats the one I did best on

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 9:05pm EST
cuz you need to be out of you mind when you take them

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 9:05pm EST
sickness makes brain all messed up

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 9:06pm EST
so obviously that why i did so well last time

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 9:06pm EST
because although i rarely leave my house

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 9:06pm EST
i always stay out late with my brain

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 9:10pm EST
Sounds about right

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 9:12pm EST
judging by the prep test

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 9:13pm EST
every answer i give will be 1

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 9:13pm EST
i've guessed one about 4 times

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 9:13pm EST
and its always been right

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 9:16pm EST
Sounds like a perfect strategy

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 9:19pm EST
better than guessing c

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 9:19pm EST
which is my strategy on reading and writing

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 9:22pm EST
yeah i'm done with sat testing today

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 9:22pm EST
i've have well and fully established that I am not gonna do well

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 9:24pm EST

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 11:11pm EST

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 11:12pm EST
nope

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 11:12pm EST
that one didn't count

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 11:12pm EST
and i totally noticed it the first time too

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 11:12pm EST
even though technically it counts more when you use military time

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 11:12pm EST
but ignore that

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 11:12pm EST
actually i saw like 4 statuses saying "11:11 am on 11/11/11!!! <3<##<#<#@>%<#T"

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 11:12pm EST
and i looked at the clock

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 11:12pm EST
and it was 11:14

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 11:12pm EST
mhmm

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 11:13pm EST

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 11:15pm EST
you're absolutely right

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 11:15pm EST

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 11:18pm EST

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 11:23pm EST
thanks for telling me

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 11:23pm EST
i was speaking in general

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 11:23pm EST
but

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 11:23pm EST
if you actually had it

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 11:24pm EST
i might almost feel bad

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 11:24pm EST
almost

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 11:24pm EST
might

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 11:24pm EST
=

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 11:24pm EST
still wouldn't

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 11:24pm EST
well seeing as i have minor scoliosis why should i feel bad?

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 11:24pm EST
i never said you should

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 11:24pm EST
but i don't have scoliosis

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 11:24pm EST
so i don't care

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 11:24pm EST
so unfeeling

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 11:25pm EST
no regrets about your apathy?

Steph Dudak November 11, 2011 at 11:25pm EST
nope

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 11:25pm EST
unsuprising

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 11:26pm EST
unsurprising*

Nick Devlin November 11, 2011 at 11:26pm EST
that damn r

Steph Dudak November 12, 2011 at 11:23am EST
I love looking through colleges to apply to and seeing this Average SAT scores 633 math | 629 critical reading | 628 writing

Steph Dudak November 12, 2011 at 11:26am EST
Not to mention Applicants accepted 34% freshman 27% transfer 19% graduate Total enrollment: 2,406

Steph Dudak November 12, 2011 at 11:26am EST
Undergraduate students: 1,975

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 8:47pm EST

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 8:48pm EST

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 8:48pm EST

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 8:48pm EST

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 8:54pm EST
Idek and idec

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 8:55pm EST

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 8:55pm EST
but i'm getting more of a vibe that its sayin i dont even know

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 8:55pm EST
and i dont even care

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:01pm EST
Yep

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:01pm EST
That's correct

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:01pm EST
look at me knowing my initialisms

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:05pm EST
Check you out

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:06pm EST
Do you think my art concentration could be like. Conveying emotions of a piece through the color and patterns used? I feel like that's what a lot of art generally is.. But I mean if my stuffs gonna be all design bases

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:06pm EST
Based*

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:06pm EST
hmm

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:07pm EST
Honestly I just don't know how to fit the things I wanna do into a concentration

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:12pm EST
yeah thats the best way I can think of to state a theme in which you could draw wahtever

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:22pm EST
Meeeeeh.

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:22pm EST
I should ask mrs. Calicchio shouldn't I

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:22pm EST
i feel like she might not accept that theme so yeah

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:23pm EST
I feel like if I wanted that as a basis she could help me shape it

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:23pm EST
But like. The pieces would reflect emotions themselves

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:24pm EST
Like I wouldn't be able to draw WHATEVER I wanted

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:24pm EST
sadness anger etc

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:24pm EST
I couldn't draw a castle

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:24pm EST
need an overall emotion for each

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:24pm EST
I was also trying to think of how to do one depictingjealousy

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:24pm EST
I just know itd be green

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:25pm EST
that's a difficult one

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:25pm EST
I'd love to figure out a way to do it without using people

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:26pm EST
I just thought of someone's shoulder with a little green monster thing sitting on it

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:26pm EST
Making the person green

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:27pm EST
thats first thing i thought of

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:27pm EST
but i dont know

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:27pm EST
seems generic

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:27pm EST
So the person would have to fade from grey to green

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:27pm EST
Yeah

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:27pm EST
But patterns and such

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:27pm EST
So so far that would be three things that use an actual person in it

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:27pm EST
I have a face An arm with a hand A shoulder Wtf

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:28pm EST
Idk how I'd make jealousy works

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:28pm EST
Without being generic and cheesy

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:29pm EST
hmm jealous is kind of an icky emotion

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:29pm EST
so with the green colout i'd say make everything kind of slimy looking

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:30pm EST
almost melting

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:30pm EST
no clue how you'd draw that texture

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:32pm EST
So like. Basically everything would be made out of alone

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:32pm EST
Wow

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:32pm EST
Really. Autocorrecting slime

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:32pm EST
As if it isn't a word

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:32pm EST
slime-->alone?

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:33pm EST
I can't even

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:33pm EST
So like

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:34pm EST
Idk how else to portray jealousy without using a person. But what I can see is this slimy little green thing on someones shoulder

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:34pm EST
Like an oozling

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:34pm EST
yes, like an oozling

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:34pm EST
and the slime could be infecting him

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
like where it touches him the person is turn grreen

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
Yk what I mean when I say that right. And like. It can be almost. Covering the person in slime. But you

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
Yeah

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
maybe it should be a monster

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
as much as like an infection disgusting blob

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:45pm EST
Well it can be a disgusting slimy monster

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
Like a green muk lol

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
yes

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:47pm EST
What if

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:47pm EST
It were multiple.

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:47pm EST
elaborate

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:47pm EST
Like a muk like thing and little oozlings

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:47pm EST
Kinda like

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:47pm EST
Embedding themselves

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:47pm EST
Into the person

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:47pm EST
a muk thing is behing the person

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:48pm EST
latching on little oozling

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:48pm EST
s

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 9:48pm EST
Please repeat that cause I don't understand what you just said lol

Not seriously. I understand that visual less

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:58pm EST

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:58pm EST

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:58pm EST
alright so there's a guy

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:58pm EST

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:58pm EST

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:59pm EST

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:59pm EST
which looks like muk is somewhere in the pic

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:59pm EST

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 9:59pm EST
but like latching on little oozlings

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 10:00pm EST
which are like hanging on the jealous man

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 10:00pm EST
and have like a sting of slime still connecting them to the main monster

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 10:05pm EST
yeah, just draw a monster on his shoulde

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 10:05pm EST
i can't explain this and i dont wanna draw ot

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 10:06pm EST
You should during lunch. You don't make a lot of sense online sometimes lol

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 10:07pm EST
sometimes?

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 10:07pm EST
Well most of the time I can eventually decipher what you actually mean

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 10:09pm EST
that doesn't mean i make sense

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 10:09pm EST
just that you are able to understand insanity

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 10:09pm EST
Lmao

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 10:10pm EST

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 10:15pm EST

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 10:15pm EST
What the fuck. Why does it keep correcting actual words

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 10:15pm EST
it also tends to correct uncommon words to more used ones

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 10:15pm EST
like ill--> I'll

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 10:15pm EST
sire--> sure

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 10:16pm EST
Dumb

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 10:17pm EST
I use sir all the time

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 10:17pm EST
your autocorrect doesn't know that

Steph Dudak November 13, 2011 at 10:17pm EST
Lame used to get corrected no matter how much I used it

Nick Devlin November 13, 2011 at 10:18pm EST
blegh

Nick Devlin November 14, 2011 at 9:59pm EST

Nick Devlin November 14, 2011 at 9:59pm EST
Hey!

Nick Devlin November 14, 2011 at 9:59pm EST

Nick Devlin November 14, 2011 at 9:59pm EST
i don't interrupt

Nick Devlin November 14, 2011 at 9:59pm EST
which isn't very much i suppose

Steph Dudak November 14, 2011 at 10:00pm EST
Nope lol. But at least your interrupts aren't blatant disregard for and ignoring everything I say.

Nick Devlin November 14, 2011 at 10:04pm EST

Tais toi Nicholas

I wish it were an hour ago so I could take a nap and wake up soon

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:34pm EST
i wish it were two hours ago and i could remember to go to academic challenge

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 3:36pm EST
That'd be cool

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:36pm EST
i really need to get on that whole time travel thing

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 3:37pm EST
That'd be fun. And totally dangerous at the same time

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 3:37pm EST
Ah time travel

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:38pm EST
depends on how time travel works in our universe

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:38pm EST
i understood

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 3:39pm EST
I feel like you'd need to be really careful. Like if you really sit there and think about it, the TINIEST things can completely alter your life and other things

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 3:39pm EST
I mean certain things wouldn't be a big deal. But others

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:39pm EST
well it goes back to which way time travel works

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:39pm EST
if there is only one timeline

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:40pm EST
then yes very very dangerous

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:40pm EST
but if mulitple timelines are created

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:40pm EST
then its not as bad

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:40pm EST
especially if you can travel between them

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:40pm EST
also how far back you go is relevant

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 3:42pm EST
Yeah that's true. Imagine that though. No imagine if time travel were possible and open to everybody

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 3:42pm EST
Imagine how the world would be oh my god

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:42pm EST
that would cause unfun things

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 3:44pm EST
Lets say for arguments sake you go back in time and if you alter something, everything else gets changed. There'd be lots of careless people. And bringing new technology into an older time period. And. All sorts of things. That'd be so crazy

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:44pm EST
lets asume its a multitimeline situation

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:44pm EST
otherwise there would be so many paradoxes my brain would exploud

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:45pm EST
and assuming a timeline is static would be equally irrelevant since everything is on a preset course

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:45pm EST
In the multi time line theory

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:45pm EST
every time a decision is made that creates the possibility for a new timeline

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:46pm EST
decisions are any act of chance

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:46pm EST
which means billions of timelines

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:46pm EST
so technically by going into the past

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:47pm EST
you are going into a sperate timeline

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:47pm EST
leaving behind a copy where you decided not to go back in time

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:47pm EST
which could possibly be visited if you had the technology

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:48pm EST
of course if you interacted in any way that might cause another time split

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:48pm EST
the green light says you left

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:48pm EST
but idc i'm having fun

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:48pm EST
so interaction might be dependant on many things

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 3:48pm EST
Nope still here

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:48pm EST
facebook is a liar

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 3:49pm EST
Just listening (reading)

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:49pm EST
then i shall finish my jumbled thoughts

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:50pm EST
the annoying thing about that is where all the energy/matter came from to create all the alternate copies

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:50pm EST
which now that i think of it

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:50pm EST
might actually account for dark matter and energy

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:50pm EST
ohh mind blwon

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:50pm EST
if i seriously just theorized the existance of dark matter

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:50pm EST
i want a nobel proze

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:50pm EST
like now

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 3:50pm EST
Lmao

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:51pm EST
obviously not for literary achievement though, prize*

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 3:53pm EST
Obviously. That's nuts though. Basically if you time travel, no matter how it works, you're going to have some issues

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 3:53pm EST
Teleportation though

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:53pm EST
same issues

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:53pm EST
matter occupying the same space

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:53pm EST
well different issue

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:54pm EST
but just as bad

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 3:54pm EST
Elaborate.

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:54pm EST
well teleportation is basically just going somewhere without going through any space

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:55pm EST
inbetween your destination and your starting point

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:55pm EST
just thinking of a way that is possible is too complex for me to do

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:55pm EST
but imagining that you would survive however the process works

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:56pm EST
you'd be leaving a void in the space you exit

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:56pm EST
and trying to fill space that already contains matter at your arrival

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:56pm EST
normally things are just pushed around

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:57pm EST
dissapearing doesn't pose much of a problem

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:57pm EST
a vacuum is created that is just filled up by surrounding air

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:57pm EST
but reappearing

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:57pm EST
might cause problems

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:58pm EST
like where the matter in the space you are about to fill is going

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:58pm EST
that could be fixed by you appearance creating a minor burst pushing all air out

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:59pm EST
along with anything else in your way

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:59pm EST
but if it wasn't you might fuse with the particles causing serious health problems

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:59pm EST
or even worse

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 3:59pm EST
on the highly off chance that your atoms collide with anything

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:00pm EST
bad things would happen

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:00pm EST
it might cause a reaction that could kill you

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:00pm EST
hell if it reacted the right way it could kill everyone

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:00pm EST
by creating a black hole

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:01pm EST
That's the problem yes. not so much leaving as appearing. When you said imagining you would survive however the process works. It made me think of the fly, when he teleports the chimp or whatever and it dies. Black holes would be an even bigger issue.

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:03pm EST
black holes really might not happen

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:03pm EST
Little things -> big problems

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:03pm EST
like stepping on a bug

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:03pm EST
that might have been that bug that gave hitler malaria

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:03pm EST
saving millions of people

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:03pm EST
but what if one of those people

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:03pm EST
was worse than hitler

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:04pm EST
and would've killed billions

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:04pm EST
so technically you've saved lives

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:05pm EST
Are you comparing Squishing a bug to creating a black hole?

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:05pm EST
both are relevant to the butterfly effect

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:05pm EST
so yes

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:10pm EST
I suppose that makes sense sorta.. Cant black holes grow?

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:11pm EST
not sure

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:11pm EST
black holes are wierd

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:11pm EST
there are singularities

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:11pm EST
kind of like the only things in the universerve that are 1-dimensional

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:11pm EST
so their physics are really confusing

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:12pm EST
its been stated that nothing can escape a black hole

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:12pm EST
not even light

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:12pm EST
because the gravity is so immense

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:12pm EST
but there is research showing that a form of radiation is outputted by the black hole

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:13pm EST
but how would that be able to escape the effects of gravitiy?

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:13pm EST
perhaps some kind of superpowerful radiation

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:13pm EST
i mean the elecrtomagnetism of a fridge magnet

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:13pm EST
Yeah so I'm just saying if they can, depending on how they can, everything could go really downhill from there. Imagine the world getting engulfed in a black hole

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:14pm EST
well it wouldn't really grow per se

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:14pm EST
it would just absorb everything near it

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:14pm EST
but a black hole would destroy the earth

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:15pm EST
probly the solarsystem

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:15pm EST
or at least majorly fuck shit up

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:16pm EST
i mean its pretty doubtful that a black hole would be creted anyway

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:16pm EST
that takes the mass of a sun, much larger than our own to create

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:19pm EST
Not saying it would be, just saying imagine if. Interesting to think about

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:20pm EST
idk if black holes grow

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:20pm EST
Apparently they can grow.

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:20pm EST
maybe more mass absorbed creates larger ones?

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:20pm EST
It's not like

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:20pm EST
They don't just suck up everything in sight

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:22pm EST
After a black hole forms it can grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. And supermassive black holes can be created by absorbing other stars and like.

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:22pm EST
Merging with other black holes

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:22pm EST
I read that somewhere but I haven't done like a study on black holes so I'm not sure of the accuracy

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:23pm EST
But I mean

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:23pm EST
thats what I was thinking

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:23pm EST
Love google and Wikipedia

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:24pm EST
It says the same thing there

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:24pm EST
And also

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:24pm EST
A supermassive black hole is the largest type of black hole in a galaxy, in the order of hundreds of thousands to billions of solar masses. Most, and possibly all galaxies, including the Milky Way,[2] are believed to contain supermassive black holes at their centers.[3][4]

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:24pm EST
hahah I was in the middle of typing that there is a supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:26pm EST
Astronomers are confident that our own Milky Way galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center, 26,000 light-years from the Solar System, in a region called Sagittarius A*[10] because: The star S2 follows an elliptical orbit with a period of 15.2 years and a pericenter (closest distance) of 17 light hours (1.8×1013 m or 120 AU) from the center of the central object.[11] From the motion of star S2, the object's mass can be estimated as 4.1 million solar masses.[12] The radius of the central object must be significantly less than 17 light hours, because otherwise, S2 would either collide with it or be ripped apart by tidal forces. In fact, recent observations[13] indicate that the radius is no more than 6.25 light-hours, about the diameter of Uranus' orbit. Only a black hole is dense enough to contain 4.1 million solar masses in this volume of space.

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:26pm EST
That's really interesting

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:28pm EST
it almost makes me want to have a job involved with astrophysics

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:28pm EST
almost

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:28pm EST
Yeah almost

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:28pm EST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWVshkVF0SY

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:28pm EST
listen to this

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:28pm EST
if you can

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:28pm EST
Kk one sec

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:33pm EST
Yep. I was going to say its really weird when you actually start to think about how things happen and how things work and how insignificant we actually are. That's a nice song, I like it.

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:35pm EST
ughh I used to think about these things every night

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:35pm EST
kind of made homewrk and school seem pointless

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:36pm EST
I occasionally get really melancholy thinking about things like that

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:36pm EST
actually

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:36pm EST
our debate next week is whether or not space exploration is worth it

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:36pm EST
in terms of money and profit and reasoning

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:44pm EST
I feel like I can't make sense of the world. Like. I can't make sense of the worth of money and things we find valuable. I understand it, but I can't make sense of it. At one point we're all going to die. That's life. Now how long our planet will be in existence is unknown as well. At some point in time I feel like everything is just going to become worthless and the entire human race will go extinct or something weird like that. Not that I mean that exactly, but that's the only example I can really give. Anyway I feel like it'd be awesome if like. Money wasn't an issue. Like it was just a thing. Do you know what I mean? Obviously that's a weird thing to say I suppose and at the same time makes no sense cause it's improbable and unlikely that such a thing can or would happen. Understandable. So just stating my opinion disregarding everything else like the issues that come with it, think space exploration is worth it. If we have the technology and can do something with it, we should put it to use. The universe is fucking big. To get to the point where we have is insane. What'd be more interesting is a discovery of some sort of life on some sort of other planet. Not necessarily life like ours or a planet like ours.

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:46pm EST
...did you write that?

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:46pm EST
I feel like life in general is strange. And the ideas humans have developed are strange

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:46pm EST
Yes

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:46pm EST
like in your own words?

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:46pm EST
Yes

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:46pm EST
enter it

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:46pm EST
in something

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:46pm EST
a competition for writing or something

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:47pm EST
i mean i'm sort of biased since that idea goes through my mind far too often

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:47pm EST
but much more well spoken than anyway I could ever elaborate upon

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:50pm EST
You are completely correct in your views by the way. Eventually everything will disappear

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:50pm EST
not just humans but all traces of human

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
the earth itself

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
our sun

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
the galaxy

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
Hahaha. Aside from my slight inability to completely say what I'm thinking but you get it right? Sometimes I really have no words to explain these things. But it's always something to think about.

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
Right?

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
I feel like we waste our time here.

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
its justlike so big

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
A lot of our time is wasted.

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
too much to think about without just realizing nothing is worth it

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
i mean even our goals seem meaningless

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:52pm EST
If you think about it on a larger scale, we live really short lives. THEY DO

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:52pm EST
What it is is we spend all this time worrying about school

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:52pm EST
Jobs

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:52pm EST
Money

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:52pm EST
like i should be finding a way to help the human race survive past the death of earth and our galaxy

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:52pm EST
Even when we do things we like

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:53pm EST
I just feel like. We should literally be able to do what we want. I don't mean that as in you know go kill people for fun bc that's you're hobby

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:53pm EST
And I'm not saying go back to old ways

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:54pm EST
But looking at it from a perspective of how people lived before our technology Before our knowledge Before money was an issue

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:54pm EST
Money and things didn't always exist

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:54pm EST
that is just innocence

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:54pm EST
Yeah

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:55pm EST
ignorance is bliss

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:55pm EST
but i would never choose ignorance over kowing

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:55pm EST
Like I said then thinking about it it's all improbable and kind of ridiculous

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:55pm EST
But recognizing it

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:56pm EST
And realizing time is sort of wasted when you only have one life to live, as far as we know

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:56pm EST
Is annoying

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:58pm EST
very

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:58pm EST
which is probly the big reason there is religion

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:58pm EST
still around

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:58pm EST
people have obviously realized these things

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:59pm EST
and is really hard to deal with every day without having some reason to keep going

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:59pm EST
religion gives people a reason

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 4:59pm EST
Absolutely. You know some people just can't stand the idea of just dying and having that be it.

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:59pm EST
i really don't like that very much either

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 4:59pm EST
just being a statistic

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:00pm EST
that people 3 generations from now won't even care about

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:00pm EST
or even realize existed

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 5:00pm EST
I mean it in the least apathetic/pessimistic way possible. But there's not like a reason for our existence really. Dying is another thing I can't grasp the concept of

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 5:00pm EST
Obviously cause in alive

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 5:00pm EST
I'm *

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 5:01pm EST
So to think that one day I'm going to stop functioning is weird to think about

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 5:01pm EST
Is weird. Minus to think about

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 5:01pm EST
Redundant.

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:04pm EST
think about thinking?

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:04pm EST
metacognition

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:05pm EST
found out that in one of my word rampages

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:06pm EST
looking up dozens of refelxive words that kind of blew my mind when i thought about them to much

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 5:06pm EST
That's what happens when I don't go back and check what I wrote before sending

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:09pm EST
know those nerdfighter things i tell you are awesome

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 5:09pm EST
Yep

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:12pm EST
here is an excerpt from a book one of the guys wrote

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:13pm EST
"There will come a time," I said, "when all of us are dead. All of us. There will come a time when there are no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything. There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra, let alone you. Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this"I gestured encompassingly"will have been for naught. Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not survive forever. There was time before organisms experienced consciousness, and there will be time after. And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you, I encourage you to ignore it. God knows that's what everyone else does."

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 5:15pm EST
And what's that book called?

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:15pm EST
the fault in our stars

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 5:20pm EST
That's interesting

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 5:20pm EST
I like that little exempt

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 5:20pm EST
Excerpt really got corrected

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:21pm EST
those two guys really have defined almost my entire outlook on life

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
my responses to most of these things would most likely have been something like mhmmm

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
interesting

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
that's cool

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
i guess

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
lol

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:27pm EST
which is why its so weird to think about how my life would have gone if i hadn't ever heard of them

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 5:29pm EST
Makes sense to me. Though in this case that's a positive thing. I have watched them before, just never like religiously or anything haha every now and then. But they're interesting Truthfully I can't stand when people answer me with things like that without anything else. I know people that will be like. Cool. Or like lol yeah. Needless to say I don't have very many conversations with those people. Carolyn is growing on me for that. She can actually have a conversation, no matter how odd the topic may be. I give her credit for that.

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 5:30pm EST
Most people don't actually go along with my rampages though lol very few do

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 5:31pm EST
And considering I've never been much of a talker anyway. Yeah

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:31pm EST
carolyn's good to talk to when you want to talk

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:31pm EST
but when you don't

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:32pm EST
she doesn't seem to realize

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:32pm EST
i have to say either she's gotten a lot better, or i'm just more tolerant

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 5:32pm EST
Little bit of both probably

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:33pm EST
i gotta say though, it was a pretty big chance that I ever saw vlogbrothers

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:33pm EST
my cousin

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:34pm EST
from scotland

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:34pm EST
visited for a like a week at my uncle's house, which I was visiting as well

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:34pm EST
and she showed me a video af them, something like 50 jokes in 4 minutes

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:34pm EST
then i watched them when i went home and never stopped

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:35pm EST
if my cousin hadn't hadn't been over

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:35pm EST
or i didn't go to my uncle's house

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:35pm EST
or if he didn't just get a new computer a month before

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:35pm EST
lots would be different

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:35pm EST
i've never talked to that cousin again btw

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:36pm EST
it's weird what turns out important and what is just forgotten

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:36pm EST
like alayna's traumatic moments

Steph Dudak November 15, 2011 at 5:39pm EST
See!

One little event. Changes your life forever

Nick Devlin November 15, 2011 at 5:46pm EST
exactly

Nick Devlin November 16, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
Concussions are fun

Nick Devlin November 16, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
you should try getting one

Steph Dudak November 16, 2011 at 9:36pm EST
o.o

Nick Devlin November 16, 2011 at 9:36pm EST
hyperbole

Nick Devlin November 16, 2011 at 9:36pm EST
mixed with sarcasm

Nick Devlin November 16, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
in case you thought any part of that statement was serious

Steph Dudak November 16, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
i didn't

Steph Dudak November 16, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
how'd you manage that?

Nick Devlin November 16, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
throwing things I probably shouldn't try to throw

Nick Devlin November 16, 2011 at 9:38pm EST
specifically 6 foot metal poles

Nick Devlin November 16, 2011 at 9:39pm EST
more specifically doing a bottom cone

Nick Devlin November 16, 2011 at 9:39pm EST
then throwing the flag straight up, silk down

Steph Dudak November 16, 2011 at 9:39pm EST
o.O

Nick Devlin November 16, 2011 at 9:40pm EST
color guard things make head hurt

Nick Devlin November 16, 2011 at 9:40pm EST
^simplified version

Steph Dudak November 16, 2011 at 9:40pm EST
you should be more careful

Nick Devlin November 16, 2011 at 9:40pm EST
yeah i know

Nick Devlin November 16, 2011 at 9:42pm EST
but in other news

Nick Devlin November 16, 2011 at 9:42pm EST
we're stilll alive

Nick Devlin November 16, 2011 at 9:42pm EST
so hopefully no one is messing with teleportation

Nick Devlin November 16, 2011 at 9:42pm EST

Steph Dudak November 16, 2011 at 9:43pm EST

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 6:58pm EST

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 6:58pm EST

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 6:58pm EST
That's lovely

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 6:58pm EST

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 7:00pm EST
Then ya gotta take the real sat soon oooo

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:01pm EST
yeah i know, maybe they'll just let me have as much time as I need for the real ones as well

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 7:03pm EST
You really should time yourself

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:04pm EST
it was timed

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:04pm EST
i went way over

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:04pm EST
for all of them

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 7:04pm EST
You should stop when times up instead of going over

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:05pm EST
that would teach me nothing

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:05pm EST
once i understand concepts

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:05pm EST
i will try timing

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 7:05pm EST
-.-

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:06pm EST
yeah i just really don't like timed tests

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:07pm EST
and i would only hve like 6 filled in if I actually stopped when the clock ran out -.-

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 7:07pm EST
Well the SAT is a timed test so get on that lol

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:08pm EST
D,:

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:15pm EST
!

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 7:15pm EST
! ?

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:15pm EST
I totally just found a major called computer graphics design

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 7:15pm EST
Where and what's it say about it

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:16pm EST
at rochester

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:16pm EST
This internationally recognized program offers concentrations in interactive design for Web, DVD, and mobile devices; three-dimensional digital graphics; motion graphics; game art and design; and information visualization. The curriculum combines knowledge of design theory, methodology, and aesthetics with skills in two- and three-dimensional computer graphics, interactive techniques, and interface design. Students utilize cutting-edge technology to produce a vast array of dynamic work for the screen (computer, broadcast, mobile).

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:16pm EST
It's like a not boring Comp. graphics and design class

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:16pm EST
by boring i mean simple

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:23pm EST
o.o

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:23pm EST
you can get Ph. D in color

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 7:23pm EST
Oh wait sorry hold on

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 7:23pm EST
I need to read that still

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:23pm EST
holding

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 7:24pm EST
That's pretty cool

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:24pm EST
its a master's

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:25pm EST
so like twice as much schoo

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 7:26pm EST
Do it

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 7:26pm EST
Yk apparently if I wanna apply to Syracuse I'll need a portfolio for architecture. Womp

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:27pm EST
like an architecture portfolio?

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:27pm EST
r a random shit portfolio?

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 7:27pm EST
No not architecture necessarily. But it needs to be all sorts of stuff and it suggested it should include drawings from life

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:29pm EST
well you have tons of art stuff

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:29pm EST
and a bunch of architecture stuff as well

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 7:29pm EST
None of its drawn from life

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:29pm EST
oh like look at a building

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:29pm EST
and recreate?

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 7:29pm EST
And stuff drawn from photos and whatnot is not strong material for a portfolio

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 7:30pm EST
Well I won't need to recreate it if I'm drawing a building that's in front of me lol

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 7:32pm EST
I'm not that good at drawing from life though. Well I haven't really done much I guess you could say. I did that one painting at cattus but that's not really a legitimate depiction of the area , know what I mean? Idk so imma need to work on that. If I wanna apply there anyway

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 7:32pm EST
The issue is the portfolio like. I can submit it online, but it's due January 15th

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:34pm EST
oh

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:34pm EST
that might be a bit more challenging i suppose

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:34pm EST
where is the school?

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 7:36pm EST
In ny

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 7:37pm EST
I'm pretty sure all the colleges I'm applying to are in PA. Then njit, and RPI and Syracuse are in NY

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:39pm EST
what else is in PA besides drexel?

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:39pm EST
and what is RPI?

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 7:41pm EST
Philadelphia university. I actually haven't looked into that one as closely so idk if I've missed any deadlines. But RPI is rensselaer. Rensselaer polytechnic institute

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:42pm EST
that sounds like a fake name

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:42pm EST
so many big words

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 7:48pm EST
Haha it's real though

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 7:48pm EST
Annoying to try to pronounce

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:48pm EST
i would hope so

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:48pm EST
re-ne-se-li-ar?

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:48pm EST
nope

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:49pm EST
i added e's in extra places

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:49pm EST
i'll live just guessing

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:55pm EST
and college has now bored me

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:55pm EST
i'm gonna play flash games

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 7:55pm EST
just cuz

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 7:57pm EST
Good idea

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 7:57pm EST
I should probably do the hw I didnt start yet

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 8:31pm EST

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 8:31pm EST
owait

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 8:32pm EST

Nick Devlin November 17, 2011 at 8:32pm EST

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 8:32pm EST
Meh

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 8:32pm EST
Lit he

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 8:33pm EST
Hw

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 8:33pm EST
I gotta do a close reading

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 8:33pm EST
I think I'll rewrite my pre calc notes

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 8:40pm EST
!!!!!!!!

Steph Dudak November 17, 2011 at 8:41pm EST

Nick Devlin November 18, 2011 at 5:00pm EST

Steph Dudak November 18, 2011 at 5:02pm EST
Lmao wow.

Nick Devlin November 18, 2011 at 5:05pm EST
the little southern horse

Nick Devlin November 18, 2011 at 5:05pm EST

Steph Dudak November 18, 2011 at 5:05pm EST

Nick Devlin November 18, 2011 at 5:05pm EST
i think this show was made for you

Steph Dudak November 18, 2011 at 5:07pm EST
Oh clearly

Nick Devlin November 18, 2011 at 5:07pm EST

Nick Devlin November 18, 2011 at 5:07pm EST

Nick Devlin November 18, 2011 at 5:07pm EST
I see them like every episode

Steph Dudak November 18, 2011 at 5:08pm EST
Haha well as fantastic as that is

Steph Dudak November 18, 2011 at 5:08pm EST
I still don't like that show

Nick Devlin November 18, 2011 at 5:08pm EST
i didn't excpect you to

Nick Devlin November 18, 2011 at 5:09pm EST
just wanted to notify you

Nick Devlin November 18, 2011 at 5:10pm EST
http://vimeo.com/32001208

Nick Devlin November 18, 2011 at 5:10pm EST
of awesome stuff

Nick Devlin November 18, 2011 at 5:10pm EST
like french country ponies

Nick Devlin November 18, 2011 at 5:10pm EST
and the video I just link

Nick Devlin November 18, 2011 at 5:10pm EST
which isn't from youtube, scary stuff

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:28pm EST
RAWR. I'm working on an art project

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
that seems like a thing to be rawring about

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:30pm EST
yesss

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:30pm EST
it's actually coming along alright

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:30pm EST
well

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:30pm EST
i accidentally colored a line red on the mouth i wasnt suppsoed to

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
supposed

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
and i had a hard time covering it up, but i don't think it looks too bad

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
anyway. i'm kind of scared to like REALLY start coloring it

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
it looks amazing

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
like the skin really

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
colour it!

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
cause it's gonna be an actual skin color

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
thats different

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
BUT ANYWAY. i'm gonna send you a picture. of my progress. after i go back upstairs and wait for my food to be finished

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
i was gonna do it grey. but i tested that that & it would look weird.

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
then i was gonna do the whole thing monochromatic

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
but that was kinda weird too

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
then i decided to make the mouth red, and it looks really good with the greens i'm using

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
if this is the envy one then both of those sound odd

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:33pm EST
then i actually put together a normalish kinda good lookin skin tone color

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:33pm EST
so imma roll with it

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 6:33pm EST
exciting

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:33pm EST
and the idea is that envy is takin over the person. controlling it. so they haven't completely been taken over yet in the drawing obviously

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:33pm EST
judging by the slime randomly dripping

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
so it needs contrast

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
grey and monochrome don't really do that well

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
no no no

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
not those together

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
i was saying for the overall thing

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
like

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
her skin would've been grey

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
and the slime still green

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
but it looked ugly

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:35pm EST
so i'm not doing that

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:35pm EST
then i THOUGHT about doing it monochromatic but it wouldn't have looked as good if everything was green.

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:35pm EST
i don't think it gives the same effect

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:36pm EST
that way with normal skin, and red lips (which is the only facial feature you see, aside from the nose. and slime is pouring out of the mount) it looks more like a person. who's all dolled up

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 6:37pm EST
that sounds awesome

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:38pm EST
i know you must be thrilled to hear about this lol. how are you?

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 6:39pm EST
i am thrilled, i mean i do like half the work on these damn project Of course i want to see the end result of all my work :P

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:40pm EST
shut up lol

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:40pm EST
I ALSO DECIDED

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 6:41pm EST
?!?!?!

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:41pm EST
for the second one. the heart thing didnt make much sense if the emotions are controlling the person, so i think imma have the veins of the heart wrap around the persons arm and whatever

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 6:41pm EST
so much infection

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:41pm EST
i'm not sure what that really says

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:41pm EST
but

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:41pm EST
YEAH

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:43pm EST
i'm kind of excited about this now. but i also wanna find a way to do these without always using people in them. but idk if that'd work lol we'll see when the time comes

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:43pm EST
but yes

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 6:45pm EST
without people?

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 6:46pm EST
that's pretty difficult if your theme is centered on emotion

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:47pm EST
Yeah exactly. So idk. I don't usually draw people so this is odd to do, as I'm also sure my proportions are always since I don't properly draw them.

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:48pm EST
This persons head may be a little too small for her body but I don't really care about proportions to be quite honest, depending what's going on in the project

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 6:49pm EST
if you went really far out there you could use the weird proportions to relate to the emotion

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 6:49pm EST
obv is large head for ego

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 6:49pm EST
but you can expand into something actually creative

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:50pm EST
so this is the head in progress. The colors are much brighter in person and this is no where close to complete cause there's only one color in the slime and no skin color Yesss. That's a good idea though I was actually thinking about that for future things bc I didn't really take it into consideration in this one.

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 6:53pm EST
i like it

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 6:53pm EST
the blobs look cool

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 6:53pm EST
how are you gonna make it look all shiny

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 6:53pm EST
or is a different kind of slime

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:54pm EST
Once I get enough different colors in, itll look more slimeish. But I can always put in white or something in spots if it's not looking slimy enough

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 6:55pm EST
kk

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 6:55pm EST
just wondering

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:55pm EST
Yeah I'm gonna be using like four different greens

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 6:56pm EST
with your fancy new colourzz

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 6:56pm EST
I know :D. These are so great

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 7:04pm EST
whats your exact concentration?

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 7:04pm EST
have you found out yet?

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 7:06pm EST
Yeah I'm just gonna make it the control emotions have over people. It's more like the control people let their emotions take over them. Cause the people aren't struggling

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 7:07pm EST
But I'm stickin with the first explanation

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 7:09pm EST
more flexible

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 7:10pm EST
Exactly

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 7:10pm EST
Oh

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 7:10pm EST
I need to send you another picture hold on

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 7:10pm EST
?

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 7:10pm EST
holding

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 7:11pm EST
Idk if you'll be able to clearly see it though ugh

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 7:12pm EST
Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 7:12pm EST
Does that ooze all the way on the right of her shoulder look weird?

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 7:12pm EST
ye

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 7:12pm EST
s

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 7:13pm EST
I thought so too. Should I leave it empty though?

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 7:13pm EST
Cause I have the giant one on her other shoulder a

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 7:13pm EST
Nd then the other going down her neck

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 7:14pm EST
i think the one on the should is weird because it's unbalanced

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 7:14pm EST
like all the slime coming off it

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 7:14pm EST
is going to to one side

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 7:14pm EST
It's en route

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 7:14pm EST
ahhh

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 7:14pm EST
its climbing

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 7:14pm EST
All that slime is under and behind it

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 7:14pm EST
But

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 7:15pm EST
I still think its kind of awkward

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 7:15pm EST
i think its fine there

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 7:15pm EST
I don't want to make the ooze bigger though cause it'll look bad near the neck one

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 7:15pm EST
you just need to fix the slime trail

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 7:15pm EST
Maybe

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 7:15pm EST
Yeah

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 7:15pm EST
and making it smaller might help

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 7:15pm EST
I was gonna say maybe if I did that lol

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 7:16pm EST
Maybe I shouldn't make the slime go directly off the edge of the ooze

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 7:16pm EST
The front of it

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 7:17pm EST
I think that's making it kind of weird too. The other has like a sort of ring around the bottom of it yk

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 7:17pm EST
yeah idk

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 7:18pm EST
i'd say just mess with the trail and junk for a bit

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 7:18pm EST
and if you can't figure out

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 7:18pm EST
just delete it

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 8:12pm EST
It saddens me that the picture of this doesn't come out as bright as the drawing actually is

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 8:13pm EST
i always feel like coloured pencil never look as good in pictures

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 8:14pm EST
Changed the lighting to iridescent. Imma send you another progression picture, one sec!

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 8:15pm EST
Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 8:16pm EST
the slime ball you coloured so far looks really cool

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 8:17pm EST
Thanks :D. Hopefully I'll have this and part of the second one done Monday so I can show you in person

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 8:17pm EST

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 9:59pm EST
Scandals and corruption eventually pervaded his administration; one of his own cabinet and several of his appointees were eventually tried, convicted, and sent to prison for bribery or defrauding the federal government.

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 9:59pm EST
at least he wasn't a good one

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 10:01pm EST
Wasn't he assassinated

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 10:01pm EST

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 10:01pm EST

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 10:01pm EST
Just died in office

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 10:01pm EST
He was on my test

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 10:01pm EST
It took me like 20 mins to remember his name

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 10:03pm EST
wow

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 10:03pm EST

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 10:03pm EST
at the inevitable mention of Harding's questionable bloodline, father and son proceeded, with shotgun in hand, to demand, and get, a retraction.

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 10:30pm EST
Have you ever watched totalbiscuit on YouTube? His channels actually total halibut wtf well it's one word obv. He used to cover wow stuff he does other games now. But he did a q and a video with Jesse cox from omfgcata. That's where he said it. Cause he's a pretty cynical guy. "the cynical Brit". And he was all cynicism is a very good thing Or something When he said that quote

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 10:31pm EST
It's like an hour long q and a video though. Id never be able to find it to show you lol. I found it pretty funny.

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 10:32pm EST
the name sounds familiar I doubt, I've ever followed him much though

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 10:33pm EST

Steph Dudak November 19, 2011 at 10:38pm EST
You should

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 10:39pm EST
The bed is a bundle of paradoxes: we go to it with reluctance, yet we quit it with regret; we make up our minds every night to leave it early, but we make up our bodies every morning to keep it late.

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 10:41pm EST
please be not sad

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 10:41pm EST

Nick Devlin November 19, 2011 at 10:41pm EST

Steph Dudak November 21, 2011 at 9:52pm EST
My second art project so far

Nick Devlin November 21, 2011 at 9:52pm EST
yay!

Steph Dudak November 21, 2011 at 9:52pm EST
That I most likely won't have done by tomorrow

Nick Devlin November 21, 2011 at 9:52pm EST
probly

Nick Devlin November 21, 2011 at 9:52pm EST
ya never know though

Steph Dudak November 21, 2011 at 9:53pm EST
Well I still gotta do my lit stuff

Steph Dudak November 21, 2011 at 9:53pm EST
This looks fucking good in pictures. Not as good in person imo lol. Skin is weird

Nick Devlin November 21, 2011 at 9:54pm EST
it makes a lot more sense now than it did when i wsaw it at lunch

Steph Dudak November 21, 2011 at 9:54pm EST
XD

Steph Dudak November 21, 2011 at 9:54pm EST
I fixed the fingers

Steph Dudak November 21, 2011 at 9:54pm EST
I don't like the middle one

Nick Devlin November 21, 2011 at 9:55pm EST
it's bent incorrectly

Steph Dudak November 21, 2011 at 9:55pm EST
Cause it's kind of awkward but yk. I'm really hesitant to color the rest of the heart though

Nick Devlin November 21, 2011 at 9:55pm EST
but it looks kinda better crooked

Nick Devlin November 21, 2011 at 9:55pm EST
makes it more painful looking

Steph Dudak November 21, 2011 at 9:55pm EST
Yeeees

Nick Devlin November 21, 2011 at 9:56pm EST
the heart

Nick Devlin November 21, 2011 at 9:56pm EST
i feel like you should practice a few times with that one

Nick Devlin November 21, 2011 at 9:56pm EST
the colors are gonna be all kinds of weird

Steph Dudak November 21, 2011 at 9:56pm EST
I kinda wanna redraw this one but

Steph Dudak November 21, 2011 at 9:56pm EST
Like I have colors I wanna use

Steph Dudak November 21, 2011 at 9:57pm EST
It's just a matter of where to put them

Steph Dudak November 21, 2011 at 9:57pm EST
Some parts need to be lighter but the heart isn't drawn like to scale with the picture I used

Nick Devlin November 21, 2011 at 9:57pm EST
you have a couple references right?

Steph Dudak November 21, 2011 at 9:57pm EST
Which is okay cause some of the parts were hard to place

Steph Dudak November 21, 2011 at 9:58pm EST
The only thing is

Steph Dudak November 21, 2011 at 9:58pm EST
Veins

Steph Dudak November 21, 2011 at 9:58pm EST
& yeah

Nick Devlin November 21, 2011 at 9:58pm EST
k good

Nick Devlin November 21, 2011 at 9:58pm EST
what's wrong with veins?

Steph Dudak November 21, 2011 at 9:58pm EST
See the colors there

Steph Dudak November 21, 2011 at 9:59pm EST
It's just that this is the main picture im working from bc it's one of the best examples I can find. See how the veins are like bluish

Nick Devlin November 21, 2011 at 9:59pm EST
they wouldn't look very vibrant

Steph Dudak November 21, 2011 at 9:59pm EST
In some parts

Steph Dudak November 21, 2011 at 10:00pm EST
Actually

Steph Dudak November 21, 2011 at 10:00pm EST
They'll look fine. I can later colors easily

Steph Dudak November 21, 2011 at 10:00pm EST
But it's more that I need to really watch it and make it not look weird

Steph Dudak November 21, 2011 at 10:00pm EST
Cause the majority of this is reds and pinks and then you have this bit of blue

Nick Devlin November 21, 2011 at 10:01pm EST
yeah

Nick Devlin November 21, 2011 at 10:01pm EST

Nick Devlin November 21, 2011 at 10:02pm EST
is this a rough draft

Nick Devlin November 21, 2011 at 10:02pm EST
or first try or whatever

Nick Devlin November 21, 2011 at 10:02pm EST
or final copy

Steph Dudak November 21, 2011 at 10:03pm EST
Well I mean I'm turning it in. But depending on how it comes out when I finish it, i might try to redraw it

Steph Dudak November 21, 2011 at 10:03pm EST
I also don't like what I just did with this red line on the hand algiejfb whatever

Nick Devlin November 21, 2011 at 10:05pm EST

Nick Devlin November 21, 2011 at 10:05pm EST

Nick Devlin November 21, 2011 at 10:06pm EST

Steph Dudak November 21, 2011 at 10:06pm EST

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 11:29am EST

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 11:29am EST

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 11:30am EST

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 11:30am EST
wonderful

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 11:30am EST
talk to you in an hour or two, or 10 minutes depending on what we do today

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 11:30am EST
alllrighty!

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 11:44am EST
so I showed up here like 20 minutes early

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 11:44am EST
Which is better than 20 late i suppose

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 11:48am EST
Well yes I suppose so lol

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 11:50am EST
Wanna see my heart drawing so far? That I'm kind of starting to dislike now that the whole things colored in

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 11:50am EST
-_- yes i want to see it, and you're not allowed to not like it

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 11:51am EST
._. Fine

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 11:51am EST
much better

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 11:51am EST
But some actual input would be nice. I haven't used my blender yet though, waiting til I'm completely finished to do do

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 11:52am EST
So *

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 11:52am EST
Idk why it corrects so. So is a word.

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 11:53am EST
heh you said doo doo

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 11:53am EST
and input would be it looks very much like a heart

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 11:53am EST
the blood trickle is a bit off

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 11:53am EST
it should be more emphasized

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 11:54am EST
I haven't worked on the hand yet lol

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 11:54am EST
Fixing that is next cause there's that and a spot by the finger that looks weird

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 11:55am EST
That I need to make not weird

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 11:55am EST
Then I gotta do the arm

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 11:55am EST
I see a couple tiny capillaries on the biggest vien looking thing, the top left part of heart the way it is oriented in that picture

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 11:55am EST
I feel like there should be more

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 11:55am EST
not like covered but 3 or 4 placed around might look more noticeable

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 11:57am EST
Alrighty

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 11:57am EST
idk I feel like you can just add tniny details that make it seem more gross and heartlike, nothing big

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 11:58am EST
I wonder if

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 11:58am EST
I could make it look more

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 11:58am EST
Not slimy looking

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 11:58am EST
But yk

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 12:00pm EST
do you want it too look slimy? Or do you want a different texture to the heart?

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:01pm EST
I want it to look like it was literally just ripped out of someone's chest

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:01pm EST
If I can make that work

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 12:01pm EST
Then you want slimy and wet

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 12:01pm EST
it should be dripping a lot as well

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:01pm EST
See all the wet shiny parts

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:01pm EST
Yes

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 12:02pm EST
more high lites, more completely white parts

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 12:03pm EST
and the texture should be a lot smoother for the red parts

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 12:03pm EST
burnishing i think its called?

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 12:03pm EST
whatever makes the colors look more solid

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 12:03pm EST
and less like colored pencil

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:03pm EST
Yeah

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:04pm EST
It'll also look smoother once I go over it with the marker but that'll help too

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 12:06pm EST
ohh marker, expanding your medium

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:07pm EST
No the blending marker lol

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:07pm EST
I should learn how to use actual markers though

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 12:07pm EST
markers are fun

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 12:08pm EST
especially sharpies

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:11pm EST
Yes very

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:11pm EST
Hm

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:12pm EST
I still need to think about what I'm gonna do for my next few projects. I wonder if I could do something in sharpie. Just black sharpie. Well I mean I literally could.

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 12:13pm EST
what emotion would go with that?

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:13pm EST
The project would have to be design based though. I have no idea

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:13pm EST
Oh

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:13pm EST
Um

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:13pm EST
I'd tell you if I could think of the name

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 12:13pm EST
describe it

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:15pm EST
Not really an emotion. Insanity maybe?

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 12:15pm EST
that sounds fun

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 12:15pm EST
and you would finally be able to do something without a person in it

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:16pm EST
Maaaybe

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:16pm EST
The whole ideas control of emotions right. I can have like

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:16pm EST
Hm

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 12:17pm EST
ohhh

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:17pm EST
These weird cracked out designs of some sort forming into something

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:17pm EST
Just a shape of a person

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 12:17pm EST
outline of a head with the chaos insde

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:17pm EST
Nothing too like

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:17pm EST
Yeah perhaps

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:18pm EST
Or an open head

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:18pm EST
With the chaos spewing out

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 12:18pm EST
and everything spilling out

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:18pm EST
Attaching itself to the person

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:18pm EST
And flying out

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 12:18pm EST
you like things attaching to people, slime hearts, chaos

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:19pm EST
Omg the designs could be like

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:19pm EST
Little people. But not people

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:19pm EST
Crazy little things

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:19pm EST
Attacking lol

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:19pm EST
Like Unknown but not.

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:20pm EST
Yk what I mean

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:20pm EST
It's fun from an animated perspective XD

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:21pm EST
These little things jumping all over a person, latching onto them, biting them, causing chaos, etc

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 12:21pm EST
tha'sfun sounding

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 12:21pm EST
what kind of little people?

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 12:21pm EST
monster looking things

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 12:21pm EST
stick people

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 12:22pm EST
normal people with torxches and pitchforkls

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:22pm EST
Yeah like stick things LOL ONG ACTUAL STICK PEOPLE.

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:22pm EST
Omg

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:22pm EST
But nah they'd be like

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:22pm EST
Well kinda like stick people but more distorted and have some sort of design to them

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:23pm EST
The person would have to look serene and pleasant.

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:23pm EST
And then start to have these ridiculous little things take over that really need to look like insanity

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 12:23pm EST
ugh time for actual church talk again later

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 12:23pm EST
keep brainstorming with yourself

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 12:24pm EST
Womp okay have fun

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 3:50pm EST
you gonna make this an animation?

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 3:50pm EST
the way you describe it makes it sounds like it

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:20pm EST
no i'm not. i'm just saying it looks fun from that perspective.

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 4:20pm EST
you should learn stop motion then animate it

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 4:20pm EST
wouldn't be THAt much work

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:20pm EST
psht naaah

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:20pm EST
i'd totally have time

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:21pm EST
omg that'd be so cool though

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 4:21pm EST
one afternoon at most it'd take

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:21pm EST
THAT'D BE SO COOL. I COULD MAKE LITTLE WEIRD LOOKIN FIGURINE THINGS AND USE REAL PEOPLE. but i couldn't have their head open

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:21pm EST
unless i get a figure of dr. finklestein. his head opens

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 4:22pm EST
you should do it one day

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:23pm EST
stop motion is so cool

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:23pm EST
that'd be cool if i had the time to do it

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 4:25pm EST
Stop motion is fun to watch, there's lots of cool things to do if you have enough time

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:25pm EST
i should get back into using photoshop.

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 4:25pm EST
i should get into learning photoshop

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:25pm EST
you should

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:25pm EST
no illustrator. i gotta learn that

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:25pm EST
ugh i have no time

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:25pm EST

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 4:26pm EST

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 4:26pm EST
oh

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 4:26pm EST
nevermind

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:26pm EST
the problem is i have no idea what's going on with this guinevere section of this book (which apparently has three sections in it but it DOESN'T)

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 4:26pm EST
i don't hae time

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 4:26pm EST
guinevere?

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 4:26pm EST
arthurs chick that lancelot steals?

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 4:27pm EST
I don't remember much of those stories

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:27pm EST
yeah from some blahblahg of the king od camelot

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:27pm EST
yep

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:27pm EST
i was reading it

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:27pm EST
and i really have no idea what's going on

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:27pm EST
i wasn't retaining anything i read

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:27pm EST
then i fell asleep

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:27pm EST
this was like a little over an hour ago

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 4:27pm EST
Those books are fun

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:27pm EST
but the essa

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:27pm EST
y

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:27pm EST
is on

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:28pm EST
"max 3 page essay using close reading of the guinevere sections and close reading of morte d'arthur showing the thematic and stylistic differences." well from one section of guinevere. she said one of the three sections

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:28pm EST
but again

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:28pm EST
all i'm seeing is one giant seection

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:28pm EST
not three

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:28pm EST
and it's a million pages

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:29pm EST
and becca and tiff are not answering me sooooooooooooo

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:29pm EST
i'm receiving no help or answers to my questions.

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 4:30pm EST
if you're comparing thematic and style difference its not like you actually need to read

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 4:30pm EST
just compare the format and setting and generic stuff

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:30pm EST
hm yeah

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:30pm EST
you have a point actualy.

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:30pm EST
cause the book is written in like

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:31pm EST
it's written like a poem. morte d'arthur is written as just a regular story

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:31pm EST
also the dialogue is different in both. there's names for it that i have to look at my notes to remember. but morte d'arthur doesn't use quotations when people speak

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:31pm EST
this thing does

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 4:31pm EST
there ya go already started a section

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:32pm EST
but then the story itself i don't really know what's going on

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 4:32pm EST
does it ask about story?

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:34pm EST
well i don't mean it like i need to write about the story

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:34pm EST
but understanding it would help

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:34pm EST
to pick up on things that might be similar in morte d'arthur as far as character set up, etc

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 4:35pm EST
yeah probly, just skim it. then go on sparknotex for details

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:36pm EST
yeah might need to do that

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:36pm EST
i can totally do this right?

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:36pm EST
yeah i can

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:36pm EST
MAX 3 page

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:36pm EST
it can be less

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:36pm EST
ftw

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 4:36pm EST

if you expect the worst, you are pleasantly surprised when things go awesome

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 4:47pm EST
that's my outlook

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 4:47pm EST

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
I tend to expect the worst and just go with the flow

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
which is easier

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 8:20pm EST
I think I need an attitude change

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 8:20pm EST
My goal is to get shit done and be ~happier. Starting Monday. AP lit will ruin that I'm sure (there's the pessimism speaking) but I'll make it work I think

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 8:21pm EST
My moms started decorating for Christmas though. That makes me pretty happy. I love Christmas decorations

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 8:21pm EST

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 8:21pm EST

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 8:22pm EST
the getting shit done will help with the happiness

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 8:23pm EST
Absolutely. I'm also gonna have to focus a lot on physics though too. Need to stop failing my tests. I'm going to make a schedule during lunch tomorrow.

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 8:26pm EST
Psht

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 8:27pm EST
oops I haven't been studying basic math

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 8:27pm EST

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 8:27pm EST

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 8:27pm EST

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 8:27pm EST
...

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 8:28pm EST
you're right

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 8:28pm EST
only people that use that stuff

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 8:28pm EST
are like humans

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 8:28pm EST
and who would want to be one of those

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 8:28pm EST
Obviously that was a subliminal message saying go study some basic math after you stop wasting time, distracting yourself, and do your homework.

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 8:29pm EST
Idk I'm not human

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 8:29pm EST
thanks for making it less subliminal

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 8:29pm EST
But I use basic math all the time

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 8:30pm EST
Everyone uses basic math all the time

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 8:31pm EST
school has actually understood that math is a useful topic to learn

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 8:31pm EST
and life is much easier when you know it

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 8:31pm EST
I wouldn't be able to do miecraft if I didn't know exponents

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 8:31pm EST
:D

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 8:31pm EST
I love being able to apply things like algebra and stuff to normal every day situations

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 8:32pm EST
i rarely use equations but fractions are fun to play with when I need real things done

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 8:33pm EST

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 8:38pm EST
Oh it can't just be like a normal name

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 8:38pm EST
i'd prefer it be not average

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 8:39pm EST

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 8:39pm EST

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 10:30pm EST

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 10:32pm EST
i have the same problem

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 10:33pm EST
Jerkoff. My first paragraph is basically saying how Arthur is written in paragraph form like a story and Guinevere in stanzas like a poem. And Arthur's dialogue is in free direct speech and Guinevere is in direct speech

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 10:33pm EST
I feel like I should say like the purpose of those like techniques or whatever

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 10:33pm EST
But I dont really know the effects of them and don't personally find them important

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 10:33pm EST
you could explain the different time periods they were written in defined their structure

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 10:42pm EST
but i can't help with more more than that. unless there is text online of both your stories

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 10:42pm EST
Icould find a couple points as long as its your work

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 10:42pm EST
if it was my homework i would never be able to find shit

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 10:42pm EST
The definitely is of Guinevere

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 10:42pm EST
But the thing is

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 10:43pm EST
She said to use out close reading of Arthur and such to do this

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 10:43pm EST
close reading?

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 10:43pm EST
Yeah picking apart every little thing in a story basically

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 10:43pm EST
I don't really know what's going on in Guinevere though

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 10:43pm EST
But

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 10:44pm EST
Max three page using close reading of section of Guinevere and of Arthur showing the thematic and stylistic differences

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 10:47pm EST
yeah, you wont be having afun time with that

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 10:48pm EST
well i doubt you have been

Steph Dudak November 27, 2011 at 10:48pm EST
Tu as raison -.-

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 10:49pm EST
only when I don't want to be

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 10:50pm EST
ugh, I need to sleep tonight. I hope you find a way to get all your stuff done

Nick Devlin November 27, 2011 at 10:51pm EST

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:32pm EST
sigh

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:32pm EST
only 2% of my life so far

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:32pm EST

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:32pm EST
2.9%

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:33pm EST
i am calm lol

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:35pm EST
well for the most part

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:35pm EST
but it's not concerning you so it's ok

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:35pm EST
what aren't you calm about?

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:40pm EST
"I wave my right to review or access letters and statements of recommendation on my behalf." is that something i should check off

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:41pm EST
ye

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:41pm EST
i went and asked guidance about it

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:41pm EST
they helped in absolutely no way

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:42pm EST
They couldn't explain what the hell it meant

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:42pm EST
alrighty

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:42pm EST
annnd

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:42pm EST
what if

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:43pm EST
oh

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:43pm EST
nevermind again

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:43pm EST
mkay

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:43pm EST
apparently i can't read

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:44pm EST
well i beg to differ

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:44pm EST
and if you disagree then i am correct

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:44pm EST
otherwise you have introduced a paradox

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:44pm EST
sklhjf;sh

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:44pm EST
then again

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:44pm EST
maybe you cant read

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:45pm EST
so did you send in your sat scores through collegeboard? is that required? cause there's a thing on this blue sheet that says "I would like my test scores mailed with my application" I hope you don't mind me bombarding you with questions

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:45pm EST
its fine

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:46pm EST
I am sending my stuff through collegeboard

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:46pm EST
i don't trust the school

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:46pm EST
lol

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:46pm EST
yeah my only concern is that it's a pain in the ass since sending through collegeboard you need to pay $10.50

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:46pm EST
i hate money i hate school

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:47pm EST
2 of the biggest reasons I am procastinating so much

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:48pm EST
like ugh

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:48pm EST
I keep hoping I'll find a way for everything to get done for free

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:48pm EST
but I doubt that will happen

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:48pm EST
i had to pay to take tests i don't wanna take. i have to pay to apply to college. i need to pay to have my SAT scores sent to them.

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:48pm EST
if i get accepted and go there i need to pay to go there.

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:48pm EST
fun stuff

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:49pm EST
assuming i'd get accepted, i should just go to njit. yeah. cool

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:49pm EST
don't forget paying all that money just so you can apply to get a job

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:49pm EST
omg

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:49pm EST
yeah

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:49pm EST
i should become a nomad

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:50pm EST
and live off the land?

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:50pm EST
and become one with nature

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:50pm EST
well there isn;t much of that left

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:50pm EST
that either

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:50pm EST
yeah

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:50pm EST
i'll build my own cottage. chop down my own trees and stuff. or something.

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:50pm EST
just kidding

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:50pm EST
that won't happen

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
i'll just spend all of this money and go to college anyway

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
and then have to pay off all this debt

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
then go be a nomad

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
or that

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
and it'll be so great

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:52pm EST
it'll be fantastic

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 4:52pm EST
is room and board costs usually like separate from tuition

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:54pm EST
yes

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:54pm EST
because lots of people live off campus

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:54pm EST
I know no one at Drexel lives on campus because the apartments nearby are like 5X cheaper

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:55pm EST
same thing with food plans

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:55pm EST
of course it depends on the school

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:55pm EST
in general though

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 4:55pm EST

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 5:00pm EST
yeah

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 5:00pm EST

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:00pm EST
just do it

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:00pm EST
don't write a new one if you've already made a good one

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 7:03pm EST
i haven't made a good one

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 7:03pm EST
so i shall write one soon

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 7:04pm EST
i wish i could copy and paste from this website. rawr.: physical science - a solid background, including physics; in the spring semester of the 1st year, architecture students take physics. prior experience with the subject matter is beneficial

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 7:04pm EST
love physics

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 7:05pm EST
i actually probably would like physics if i understood it better. did i tell you. i didn't. he decided to hand out notes this time. so i'll have to rewrite them so a) i can read them and b) i actually retain some of the information before i go back to study it again

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 7:05pm EST
and again

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:09pm EST
physics is really cool

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:09pm EST
i only like the theory though

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:09pm EST
not the math

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:09pm EST
although the math might be fun if i had an awesome teacher

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:10pm EST
but i don't think those are too common

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 7:10pm EST
not reallly

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:11pm EST
I still watch lots of videos and tv shows about physics and astrophysics

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:15pm EST
because that's an acceptable qualification for college

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 7:16pm EST
i'd like to think so

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 7:16pm EST
XD

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 7:18pm EST
fun fact

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 7:18pm EST
syracuse is about 5 hours away from my house

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:18pm EST
that is a fun fact

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:18pm EST
you can make it

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 7:18pm EST
RPI is about 4

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:19pm EST

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:21pm EST
fun fact

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:21pm EST
rochsester is about 7 hours

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:21pm EST
and

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:21pm EST
it cost 700 for a plane there

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:21pm EST
unles

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:21pm EST
i drive to philly and get a plane ride from that airport

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:21pm EST

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:21pm EST

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:21pm EST
which makes sense

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 7:21pm EST

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:23pm EST

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:27pm EST

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:28pm EST

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 7:28pm EST
ugh good question

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 7:28pm EST
i probably should

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 7:28pm EST
simply because they are so far away and i am unfamiliar with the area they are in. RPI is actually pretty close to where my friend alex lives

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 7:28pm EST

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 7:28pm EST

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:43pm EST

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:44pm EST
no, you should get letters from people that are relevant to your major

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:45pm EST
as long as you are taking the same major at each school

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:45pm EST
you use the same letteres

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 7:45pm EST
that's what i meant

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:46pm EST
yeah, you only get some from a couple teachers and reuse them again and again

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 7:46pm EST

(New Jersey residents only) I would like to be considered for the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP). If yes, we will follow up with you. why doesn't it tell me what that is

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
oh

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
The Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) is a state funded program for New Jersey students who are educationally and economically challenged and who are greatly underrepresented in science and technological fields.

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
greatly underrepresented?

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 7:57pm EST
New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) was among the earliest higher education institutions in the State to accept the challenge posed by the New Jersey Department of Higher Education to "identify, recruit and provide financial assistance to needy students who are residents of this State in order that they may be able to attend institutions of higher education." In response to this challenge, the Engineering Opportunity Program was established in 1968. It was renamed the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) in 1975 to reflect its broader mission of providing access to other areas of study at the university, including architecture, science, and business. From an initial enrollment of 19 students, EOP has grown to over 650 currently enrolled. The university has consistently displayed strong commitment to and support for EOP, and provides adequate resources to assure the Program's success.

Nick Devlin November 29, 2011 at 7:58pm EST
so if you're poor enough you'll get enough money to not be in debt for the rest of your life

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 7:58pm EST
educationally challenged?

Steph Dudak November 29, 2011 at 7:58pm EST

UGH

Steph Dudak November 30, 2011 at 11:55pm EST
I unliked it by accident lol

Steph Dudak November 30, 2011 at 11:55pm EST
So I had to relike it

Steph Dudak November 30, 2011 at 11:55pm EST
I was hoping it would go unnoticed. However, that's impossible in the world of Facebook.

Nick Devlin November 30, 2011 at 11:56pm EST
yeah pretty much

Nick Devlin November 30, 2011 at 11:56pm EST
I'm kind of annoyed actually

Nick Devlin November 30, 2011 at 11:56pm EST
those Lies I wrote a few months back

Nick Devlin November 30, 2011 at 11:56pm EST
are better written than most of my essays

Nick Devlin November 30, 2011 at 11:56pm EST
Like they have structure and transitions

Nick Devlin November 30, 2011 at 11:56pm EST
and heavy irony

Nick Devlin November 30, 2011 at 11:57pm EST
like as heavy as a neutron star heavy

Steph Dudak November 30, 2011 at 11:58pm EST
Pretty heavy

Steph Dudak November 30, 2011 at 11:58pm EST
Think about those lies when you write essays

Nick Devlin November 30, 2011 at 11:59pm EST
I am the worst student possible for you to pick to go to your school

Nick Devlin November 30, 2011 at 11:59pm EST
hmm

Nick Devlin November 30, 2011 at 11:59pm EST
I don't think that went

Nick Devlin November 30, 2011 at 11:59pm EST
quite as i planned

Steph Dudak November 30, 2011 at 11:59pm EST
Structure wise

Steph Dudak November 30, 2011 at 11:59pm EST
Derp

Nick Devlin November 30, 2011 at 11:59pm EST
:P

Nick Devlin December 1, 2011 at 12:00am EST
i figured

Nick Devlin December 1, 2011 at 12:00am EST
but if I want to write

Nick Devlin December 1, 2011 at 12:00am EST
I need to have control of my brain

Nick Devlin December 1, 2011 at 12:00am EST
which isn't really likely this late

Steph Dudak December 1, 2011 at 12:01am EST
Well I'd hope you would be the one controlling it

Nick Devlin December 1, 2011 at 12:01am EST
well I have an influence

Nick Devlin December 1, 2011 at 12:01am EST
but it seems to have a mind of its own

Steph Dudak December 1, 2011 at 12:01am EST
Ooooooooorly

Nick Devlin December 1, 2011 at 12:02am EST
you didn't space

Nick Devlin December 1, 2011 at 12:02am EST
it discombobulated me

Nick Devlin December 1, 2011 at 12:02am EST
orly

Nick Devlin December 1, 2011 at 12:02am EST
oorly

Nick Devlin December 1, 2011 at 12:06am EST
yeah this is why I'm not writing right now, I'm going to sleep now

Nick Devlin December 1, 2011 at 12:07am EST
because I keep writing stupid things

Nick Devlin December 1, 2011 at 12:07am EST
which I suppose isn't much different from normally

Nick Devlin December 1, 2011 at 12:07am EST
but this a stupider kind of stupid

Nick Devlin December 1, 2011 at 12:07am EST

i am trying to be polite and not shout as you can see by my lack of caps

Nick Devlin December 1, 2011 at 5:20pm EST
During my first years of High School I took a class called Intro to Computer Graphics and Design. I had always liked to draw on the computer so it seemed like a fun course to take. When the course started however, we werent even allowed access on the computers. We were given paper and pencils, then shown how to draw circles and lines; of course rulers and compasses were more forbidden that were not to be mentioned. Only after we had proven we were able to draw straight lines and round circle were we given permission to start our first project. On paper. I was beginning to think that although the drawing techniques we were learning were interesting, this class was kind of missing the point of the Computer graphics aspect. Surprisingly it turns out that I had no clue what I was doing and the teacher did. Without all the preparation from drawing and learning the feel of our designs it would have made drawing on the computer useless. I learned a sense of proportion and how things all fit on a paper, along with the layout of the paper and other things that I would never have learned solely on the computer. I loved all the different things that went into making projects look right, the colors and shapes that defined it. Ive been trying to take as many art and computer classes that can fit into my schedule since then. Somehow I have only this year been able to find a way to fit the Advanced Computer Graphics and Design Course into my schedule, and Im ecstatic that I have been able to. So far this year my projects have been frustrating and seem like they will go well, but in the end Im always proud of how they turn out. I love computers and design is one of the most enjoyable things I like to do so I sincerely hope that I am able to make it a bigger part of my life.

My drexel essay

Steph Dudak December 1, 2011 at 5:24pm EST
One sec

Nick Devlin December 1, 2011 at 5:24pm EST
whenever you got time

Nick Devlin December 1, 2011 at 5:25pm EST
i'm starting another essay right now

Steph Dudak December 1, 2011 at 5:32pm EST
Introduction And access TO the computers. "of course rulers and compasses were more forbidden that were not to be mentioned" I don't get what you're saying here Round circles* not circle take out point in "... This class was kind of missing the point of the computer graphics aspect" also do not capitalize computer Surprisingly, Add a comma Turned out not turns out. "I learned a sense of proportion and how things all fit on a paper" take out all or reword it bc it sounds awkward how you have it there in my opinion Reword that somehow sentence. Blahblahblah but I am ecstatic instead of and So far the projects have been frustrating and seem like they will go well? Will not go well? I mean if they're frustrating. One of the most enjoyable things I do. Not like to do. Or um no that still sounds a little weird. But like to do us redundant

Steph Dudak December 1, 2011 at 5:32pm EST
Otherwise it's fine

Steph Dudak December 1, 2011 at 5:32pm EST
Just grammatical things and whatnot

Steph Dudak December 1, 2011 at 5:35pm EST

Steph Dudak December 4, 2011 at 10:06pm EST
World affairs project = due in a week. Seven sections, 15 slides each, the entire thing needs to have music. Rofl I should just put on octavarium for the entire thing. 20 minute song, 6-12 min presentation bam. Anyway I didn't even start yet. Well I'll get like 15 slides done in a few mins bc I have a list of dead people. Physics test Thursday which makes me want to cry. Art projects on Wednesday. Barely have one started.... That's the main thing. I need to do pre calc and lit hw right now still cause I decided to not finish yesterday and help decorate my house. The only upside to this week is I get out of gym and lit on Wednesday bc I'm giving blood. Otherwise this week sucks. Omg that's awful ): I hate colds. They ruin everything basically. Cept I had one the last time I took my SATs and I got a much better score on that one so.

Nick Devlin December 4, 2011 at 10:08pm EST
That's wuite a bit, Kerry or I could get you into to TV21 afterschool to do your project probly

Nick Devlin December 4, 2011 at 10:09pm EST
and they won't fricking let me give blood because I don't have a lcense I'm pretty pissed about it

Nick Devlin December 4, 2011 at 10:09pm EST
I am gonna find who is in charge and ask them for another way

Nick Devlin December 4, 2011 at 10:09pm EST
because I gave blood last year why the hell is driving a prerequisite

Nick Devlin December 4, 2011 at 10:10pm EST

Steph Dudak December 4, 2011 at 10:11pm EST
Oh thanks but that won't be necessary. I think I'll be able to do it at home. I plan to get on it tomorrow as soon as I get home , lol, and then do art project stuff, and then start studying for physics

Steph Dudak December 4, 2011 at 10:11pm EST

Steph Dudak December 6, 2011 at 7:51pm EST

Steph Dudak December 6, 2011 at 7:51pm EST
I made it work

Nick Devlin December 6, 2011 at 7:51pm EST
mkay

Steph Dudak December 6, 2011 at 7:51pm EST
I'm really scared to color it kinda

Nick Devlin December 6, 2011 at 7:52pm EST
when isn't it scary?

Steph Dudak December 6, 2011 at 7:52pm EST
Steph Dudak December 6, 2011 at 7:52pm EST
I was thinking pinks oranges and reds on the inside

Steph Dudak December 6, 2011 at 7:53pm EST
Have the brain glow yellow. Outline the face in white. Have the background black.

Nick Devlin December 6, 2011 at 7:54pm EST
sounds good to me

Nick Devlin December 6, 2011 at 7:54pm EST
are you making the word standout like it is right now?

Steph Dudak December 6, 2011 at 7:55pm EST
That was the next thing

Steph Dudak December 6, 2011 at 7:55pm EST
I feel like it should stand out more than the rest

Steph Dudak December 6, 2011 at 7:55pm EST
Not like OMG HERE I AM

Steph Dudak December 6, 2011 at 7:55pm EST
But a little more. So it's a little more Obvious what I'm trying to portray here

Nick Devlin December 6, 2011 at 7:57pm EST
I have no clue how

Nick Devlin December 6, 2011 at 7:57pm EST
but if you could make it on a different plane

Nick Devlin December 6, 2011 at 7:57pm EST
that might work

Steph Dudak December 6, 2011 at 7:57pm EST
The lines I can make darker thanthe rest

Nick Devlin December 6, 2011 at 7:57pm EST
like have it sunken in

Nick Devlin December 6, 2011 at 7:57pm EST
or bulging out

Steph Dudak December 6, 2011 at 7:57pm EST
Like that make u the words

Steph Dudak December 6, 2011 at 7:58pm EST
Yeah I could do that

Steph Dudak December 6, 2011 at 7:58pm EST
Be more effective beveled I think

Nick Devlin December 6, 2011 at 7:59pm EST
probly

Nick Devlin December 6, 2011 at 7:59pm EST
I have no clue how to shade it to make it look that way

Nick Devlin December 6, 2011 at 7:59pm EST
but that's your job

Nick Devlin December 6, 2011 at 7:59pm EST
so I don't have to know

Steph Dudak December 6, 2011 at 7:59pm EST
Lmao yes

Steph Dudak December 6, 2011 at 8:05pm EST
How cool does that look!

Nick Devlin December 6, 2011 at 8:09pm EST
that's kinds the exact picture you are doing

Nick Devlin December 6, 2011 at 8:10pm EST
this how you picked the colors?

Steph Dudak December 6, 2011 at 8:10pm EST
No I just found this now o.o

Nick Devlin December 6, 2011 at 8:10pm EST
creepy

Steph Dudak December 6, 2011 at 8:11pm EST
Ik o.o but it's pink and orange on the inside.and red. I'm gonna add yellow on the outsides but why does that happennnn

Nick Devlin December 6, 2011 at 8:18pm EST

Nick Devlin December 6, 2011 at 8:41pm EST
This week will not go wrong

Nick Devlin December 6, 2011 at 8:41pm EST

I was sitting out today at color guard

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 9:36pm EST
at the end of practice we got all our equipment back

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
since it got taken after try outs

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
I tried to spin the rifle

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
but it was a different weight

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
now my toe

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
is full of blood

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
which is fine

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 9:38pm EST
but its sorta gushing out of my toe as well

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 9:38pm EST
which is not as much fine

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 9:38pm EST
i can see where that would be an issue

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 9:39pm EST
you should probably clean that

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 9:39pm EST
and stuff

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 9:39pm EST
yeah i have

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 9:39pm EST

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 9:42pm EST

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:10pm EST
i howw

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 10:10pm EST
totally was hoping that was a word

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 10:10pm EST
but its not

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:10pm EST
i HAVE

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:11pm EST
douchebaggery might as well be a word

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 10:11pm EST
it'll be added in like 2 years if its not already

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:12pm EST
for sure

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:12pm EST
so i have barely any of my history project done

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:12pm EST
i hate

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:12pm EST
having to do

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:12pm EST
like movie/powerpoint presentations

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:13pm EST
and i hate the time restriction

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:13pm EST
bc

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:13pm EST
we need 7 sections, 15 slides each, a song for each section, and the entire thing needs to be between 6 and 12 minutes

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:13pm EST
so then i gotta cut the songs and everything

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:13pm EST
and

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:13pm EST
whatnot

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 10:13pm EST
exciting

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:13pm EST
NO

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 10:13pm EST
unexciting

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:14pm EST
yes

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:14pm EST
cause im not having fun

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:14pm EST
and will be spending my entire weekend doing this

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:16pm EST
now imma try to burn these 16 slides to a blank dvd that way i can test it in class tomorrow to see if itll work when i have to actually go for my project

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 10:17pm EST
always a good idea

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 10:19pm EST
orrrr

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 10:19pm EST
test it on the first day

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 10:19pm EST
test*

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:19pm EST
no

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:19pm EST
if it doesnt work itll be a grade down

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 10:19pm EST
then you get an extra day to do it

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 10:20pm EST
that douche

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:20pm EST
we've had a month to do this project though. that's what this week is for really. and he's said 483746 times come in whenever and test to make sure it works just in case

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 10:20pm EST
grr

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 10:20pm EST
i could never take that class

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 10:22pm EST
mr knight

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 10:22pm EST
someone once gave him an empty flashdrive

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 10:22pm EST
as their video project

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 10:22pm EST
they got a B

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 10:23pm EST
nothing was ever mentioned about how it was empty

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 10:24pm EST
thats the history teacher who you should have

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:24pm EST
how did that even happen

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:24pm EST
x.x

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:26pm EST
my group didnt even show ours in class lol. jen recorded the moviemaker project cause she couldnt get it onto the flash drive or something dumb like that and we just showed him on her camera and he was like k cool A

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 10:29pm EST
at least they had something

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:34pm EST
I just hate video projects lol

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 10:35pm EST
they're usually not fun unless you're into it

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 10:35pm EST
since they take so much damn work

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:39pm EST
Exactly

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:39pm EST
I could be spending my time doing other things

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:40pm EST
Like all the other hw I have to do. And my art projects. I really wish I didn't need to take all these bs classes that idc about

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 10:40pm EST
yeah well it'll probly turn out better for you in the end

Steph Dudak December 7, 2011 at 10:40pm EST
It better

Nick Devlin December 7, 2011 at 10:41pm EST
or else

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:11pm EST
this whole physics thing

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:11pm EST
if you do

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:12pm EST
1.3829 = 2pv.48/g what do you get.

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:12pm EST
is that a pi symbol?

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:12pm EST
yes

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:13pm EST
where's the variable?

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:13pm EST
the g?

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:13pm EST
yeah solve for g

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:14pm EST
the square root goes completely over the .48/g right?

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:14pm EST
yes

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:17pm EST
umm

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:17pm EST
the g stands for gravity, so the number should be close to 9.8

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:17pm EST
and i'm not getting anything near that at all

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:17pm EST
do you really want to wait for me to do this?

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:17pm EST
but that was the equation peck gave us sooo

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:17pm EST
if you're willing to do it

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:17pm EST
this lab isn't due or anything soon

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:18pm EST
i don't hand these in til the end of the marking period and brenna just asked me a question about it which compelled me to attempt to solve it but i failed

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:18pm EST
yeah, I am trying but I don't remember all the ways to solve equations

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:18pm EST
first you divide the 2 pi right?

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:18pm EST
then sqare both sides

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:19pm EST
that's what i tried doing

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:19pm EST
okay ready

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:19pm EST
hold on

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:21pm EST
1.3829 = 2pv.48/g 0.220095371 = v.48/g .048441972 = .48/g and if you multiply or divide by .48 you get a tiny tiny number

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:21pm EST
pretty much

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:22pm EST
wait

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:22pm EST
no

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:22pm EST
so obviously im doin somethin wrong

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:23pm EST
maybe somethin with the squaring?

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:23pm EST
I have no clue

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:24pm EST
I am getting the same answers as you

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:25pm EST
exactly! but you need to square both sides to undo a radical, but if you square a small number like that then you get an even smaller number

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:25pm EST
even doing .48/.048

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
gets like 12.blablabla

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
even if you were completely ignoring the rules of math

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
yeah i tried doing that!

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
then i tried testing the equation with other numbers

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
like

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:27pm EST
4 = 2v16/x

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:27pm EST
x has to equal 4 there

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:28pm EST
but that doesn't help me at all

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:32pm EST
not really

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:33pm EST
i mean that makes x like 4

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:33pm EST
which is kind of irrelevant

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:37pm EST
I'm not really much help here sorry

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:37pm EST
try kevin

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:38pm EST

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:49pm EST

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:50pm EST

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:50pm EST

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:50pm EST

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:50pm EST

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:50pm EST

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:50pm EST
bc apparently i don't have a pun tag

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:50pm EST
which is absurd

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 5:53pm EST
i can't believe i forgot to make that one of the tags that show up on my page

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:58pm EST

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 5:58pm EST

hahaha

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:07pm EST
totally found a better thing

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:07pm EST
than telling puns all the time

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:08pm EST
NOT telling puns all the time

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:08pm EST
then saying No pun intended after random sentences

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:14pm EST
sdjkhgrh

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:15pm EST
a man submitted ten puns to a contest hoping one of them would win. no pun in ten did.

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:15pm EST
I don

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:16pm EST
't know what to type

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:16pm EST
hahahaha

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:16pm EST
or -.-

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:16pm EST
i'd go with option one

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:16pm EST
that kind of fails if you're just telling it in person though, apparently

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:18pm EST
jan is so stupid

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:19pm EST
jan?

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:19pm EST
yes

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:19pm EST
jan

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:19pm EST
didn't he graduate?

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:19pm EST
asian

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:19pm EST
yes

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:20pm EST
so?

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:20pm EST
anyway today he texted me asking:

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:20pm EST
what caused you to point out his stupidity?

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:20pm EST
and i guess I'll find out now

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:21pm EST
rofl this is exactly how he sent it actually. talk about awful grammar. but you get the idea. "Kira!! Ok, so if there only 2 people alive on the world. You and a random hobo, would save help repopulate the world or no?"

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:21pm EST
so i said

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:21pm EST
i'll read the rest once i stop laughing

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:24pm EST
but in doig that, like. wouldnt the children have to repopulate with each other as well? so wouldnt that cause some genetic issues. well either way i probably wouldn't. well good bye human race genetic mutations jan, might as well just die off with everyone else >_> just sayinnnn so you'll just let the human race die. mutation can be good in some ways. we huans have mutated and evolved over centuries. or it can get worse and worse and worse so you won't take the risk? wuss personally i don't care to take care of a bunch of kids, have my daughter marry my son, have kids, then have my granddaughter have kids with my other son laaaazy ...Lol it's not lazy. you do realize it's just one giant family that's marrying into each other over and over and over again. i'm not what good that'll do. surely you can't expect the majority of them to be without significant defects

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:26pm EST
Steph how could you be so self centered

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:26pm EST
what if the hobo was really hot?

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:26pm EST
THAT'S WHAT KERRY SAID

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:26pm EST
"WHAT IF THE HOBO WAS REALLY HOT?"

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:26pm EST
then i mentioned birth defects and whatnot and she's like o true

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:27pm EST
pshh it takes at least 4-5 generations before anything really bad happens

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:27pm EST
even still

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:27pm EST
if the hobo is really attractive

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:28pm EST
we'll have one kid

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:28pm EST
no we won't

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:28pm EST
because

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:28pm EST
there are no doctors around or anything. one of us would end up giving birth to my child

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:28pm EST
and what if something goes wrong

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
he sure as hell won't be able to fix it

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
and architecture doesn't help in those situations

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
NOTHING GOOD CAN COME OUT OF IT

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
...and you can build a house on your own?

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:30pm EST
by cutting down the wood

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:30pm EST
and creating the glass

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:30pm EST
after collecting and purifying the sand

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:30pm EST
and making the plastic

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:30pm EST
oh theres the cement

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:30pm EST
did i say i was going to be able to do all of that?

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:30pm EST
and pillars

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:30pm EST
if there's no one i nthe world

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:30pm EST

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:30pm EST

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:30pm EST
OH

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:30pm EST

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
go to an aiport

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
you know all the food in food stores will eventually expire

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:31pm EST

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
but in the opposite direction!!

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
oh man!!

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
livin on the edge!!

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
i should get flying lessons before this happens

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
so i can fly myself to other countries before i die

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
so you can steal a plane and go wherever the hell you want once the apocalypse leaves you alone

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
then the hobo won't be a hobo anymore either

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
he'll be able to shower and wear actual clothes

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
along with hobos being a class in society

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:33pm EST
and without society

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:33pm EST
he's just a human

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:33pm EST
a very rare species

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:37pm EST

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:38pm EST

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:38pm EST
I'm having fun with these

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:39pm EST
i'm sending that in bread picture to jan

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:39pm EST
what are the odds he'll get it

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:39pm EST
we'll find out

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:39pm EST
you know one time i was playing super smash brothers

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:39pm EST
speaking of relevant

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:39pm EST
which this isn't

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:39pm EST
and i made all four slots CP and i made them all link

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:40pm EST
actually it kinda is

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:40pm EST
anyway i made them all link

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:40pm EST
they all had ten lives, and i just sat and watched them fight.

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:40pm EST
i was with my cousins and whatever. and when the first one died, i said "You are the Weakest Link, goodbye."

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:40pm EST
and it was awesome

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:41pm EST
the original green link won btw

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:41pm EST
I can imagine you doing that

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:41pm EST
then doing it again

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:41pm EST
and again

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:41pm EST
and still finding it just as hilarious

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:41pm EST

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:49pm EST

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:50pm EST
uggh i wish you hadn't seen the irrelephant one like 10 minutes ago

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:50pm EST
or i would totally have used it

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:50pm EST
doubtful you would have mentioned it

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:50pm EST
but still

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:51pm EST
that would've been perfect, that's a shame

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:52pm EST
ahh well

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 6:59pm EST
wanna help me think of questions to ask for my debate tomorrow?

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:59pm EST
of course

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 6:59pm EST
love debate

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 7:00pm EST
http://www.idebate.org/debatabase/topic_details.php?topicID=55 this is just one of the things i'm working from

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:01pm EST
ahh that one is a pretty common debate topic

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:01pm EST
i'm guessing you didn't get to choose your ow

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:01pm EST
n

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 7:01pm EST
no we do

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 7:01pm EST
but i need something that people can actually talk about

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 7:01pm EST
tiff and i have to run it tomorrow

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 7:01pm EST
but

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 7:02pm EST
i was thinking of doing one on like. religion as a basis for morality. but we talk about religion a lot in our debates in general

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:03pm EST
religion gets kind used a lot as well

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:03pm EST
mostly beause its so easy to debate

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 7:03pm EST
well the point is that these topics should be easy to debate

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 7:03pm EST
cause if no one talks we get a bad grade

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 7:03pm EST
SO NICHOLAS

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 7:03pm EST
if you would refer to the first question i asked you

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:03pm EST
i can think of a few

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 7:04pm EST
if you would help me think of questions to ask

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 7:04pm EST
that'd be swell

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:04pm EST
all right generic things to ask would be the obvious ones about What if the person has a 100% chance of living the rest of life in pain

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:05pm EST
I know they already have ways to have people deny people the right to save their lives

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:06pm EST
You could say that is a form of assisted suicide

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:06pm EST
These questions are to keep the conversation up if it dies down right?

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 7:07pm EST
yes

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 7:07pm EST
of course i need questions to start off with you know

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:07pm EST
hmm other things might be to discuss coma patients

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:08pm EST
and how long they should be kept alive

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:08pm EST
etc

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:09pm EST
another thing might be to discuss humane ways of killing someone

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:09pm EST
if you really wanted you could bring up the subject of the death penalty and tie that in somehow

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 7:09pm EST
well

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 7:11pm EST
i mean normally they're administered a lethal injection that would end their life painlessly so

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:12pm EST
just thinking outloud

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:12pm EST
...in text

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:12pm EST
whatever

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:12pm EST
umm

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:12pm EST
an easy way to bring more conversaton might be to bring up the religious taboo of suicide

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:12pm EST
idk

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 7:13pm EST
that could kinda go along with asking peoples opinions on if it's right or wrong. and why they think that i suppose.

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:14pm EST
yep

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:14pm EST
just things you could add in if no one else mentions

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 7:14pm EST
http://www.dignityindying.org.uk/doc/your_rights.pdf

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:15pm EST

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:17pm EST
Its also kinda creepy seeing Your rights at the end of life

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:17pm EST
End of Life

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:17pm EST

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:18pm EST
must suck to have to read that

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:18pm EST
anyway

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 7:18pm EST
i'm just skimmin through, taking things from those DID YOU KNOW boxes and stuff

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:18pm EST
That looks like a fun book you can use

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:19pm EST
I feel like a lot of people would have facts that are wrong compared to this book

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 7:21pm EST
page 11

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 7:21pm EST
dont mind that

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 7:21pm EST
just for when i need to go back

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:21pm EST
mkay

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 7:24pm EST
this is interesting

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 7:25pm EST
TREATMENTS YOU CAN REFUSE Cardiopulmonary Resucitation (CPR) Mechanical or artificial ventilation Artificial nutrition and hydration Antibiotics TREATMENTS YOU CANNOT REFUSE Food and water Pain relief Advance Decisions do not allow people to refuse basic care, which includes comfort, personal hygiene and pain relief. The people who care for you will do everything to keep you comfortable and pain-free at the end of your life.

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:27pm EST
those sort of make sense

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 7:38pm EST
Currently, 34 STATES have statutes explicitly criminalizing assisted suicide : Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin NINE states criminalize assisted suicide through common law: Alabama, Idaho, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, South Carolina, Vermont, West Virginia THREE states have abolished the common law of crimes and do not have statutes criminalizing assisted suicide : North Carolina, Utah, Wyoming In Ohio, that state's supreme court ruled in October 1996 that assisted suicide is not a crime. In Virginia, there is no real clear case law on assisted suicide , nor is there is a statute criminalizing the act, although there is a statute which imposes civil sanctions on persons assisting in a suicide. Only the states of Oregon and Washington permit physician-assisted suicide. not that you care for any of this lol

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 7:39pm EST
need somewhere to copy?

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 7:44pm EST
mhm

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 8:10pm EST
http://www.assistedsuicide.org/ websites that look like this make me want to cry

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 8:10pm EST
especially since i see a recent update

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 8:13pm EST
still trying to fgure out the site

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 8:14pm EST
I hope you're talking about the format of the site

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 8:14pm EST
and not like old people dying

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 8:14pm EST
or i'd feel kinda bad right now

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 8:25pm EST
yes i am

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 8:25pm EST
the format

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 8:25pm EST
it's so ugly

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 8:25pm EST
The only four places that today openly and legally, authorize active assistance in dying of patients, are: Oregon (since l997, physician-assisted suicide only); Switzerland (1941, physician and non-physician assisted suicide only); Belgium (2002, permits 'euthanasia' but does not define the method; Netherlands (voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide lawful since April 2002 but permitted by the courts since l984). WHY WASN'T THIS AT THE TOP OF THE LIST

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 8:25pm EST
jesus christ

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 8:27pm EST
because life is stupid

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 8:27pm EST
why didn't you use wikipedia?

google: is assisted suicide legal in montana

Nick Devlin December 8, 2011 at 8:43pm EST
google is always the greatest aid

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 8:43pm EST
Physicians in Montana should not fear criminal prosecution when writing lethal prescriptions for mentally competent patients with terminal illnesses, the state's supreme court said in a 4-2 decision issued Dec. 31, 2009. Because patients consent to their own deaths and administer the lethal medications themselves, physicians would be shielded from homicide liability under state law, the court said in its decision in the case of Baxter v. Montana. The ruling makes Montana the third state, after Oregon and Washington, where physician-assisted suicide is legal.

Steph Dudak December 8, 2011 at 8:51pm EST

Steph Dudak December 10, 2011 at 10:53pm EST

Steph Dudak December 10, 2011 at 10:53pm EST
it looks pretty damn good as well

Steph Dudak December 10, 2011 at 10:54pm EST

Steph Dudak December 11, 2011 at 4:12pm EST
that was the easiest section

Steph Dudak December 11, 2011 at 4:12pm EST
it's not really stupid ?

Steph Dudak December 11, 2011 at 4:12pm EST
it's stupid that each of these sections has to have a minimum of 15 slides

Steph Dudak December 11, 2011 at 4:12pm EST
but i guess it has to have a lot since you're covering a whole year

Nick Devlin December 11, 2011 at 4:15pm EST
what celebrity new is there besides deaths i mean

Nick Devlin December 11, 2011 at 4:15pm EST

Nick Devlin December 11, 2011 at 4:21pm EST

Steph Dudak December 11, 2011 at 4:42pm EST

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:28pm EST
my oh my

Nick Devlin December 12, 2011 at 9:28pm EST
did you pick more emotions?

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:29pm EST
well i had like little ideas

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:30pm EST
like

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:30pm EST
confusion

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:30pm EST
and

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:30pm EST
agony

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:30pm EST
though the one for agony is obviously not pleasant,

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:30pm EST
i don't think i'll be able to actually put what's in my head onto paper

Nick Devlin December 12, 2011 at 9:30pm EST
i like confusion, pain I have no clue about

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:31pm EST
confusion i'd have to decide what i want to do

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:31pm EST
the first thing that came into my mind was a person made up of a buncha arrows going in every possible direction lol

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:31pm EST
of course

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:31pm EST
lame

Nick Devlin December 12, 2011 at 9:32pm EST
do you have ideas for agony?

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:33pm EST
kinda. it's more like a monster ripping out of someone and then attaching itself to the person. the only way i can describe parts of the ~monster would be stringy. but not stringy. idk how to explain it ok. but then i was like. i dunno if that's even possible, i dunno what id do it in, (lol colored pencil wut else)

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:34pm EST
i need to kind of push the idea of control of emotions and keep it actually interesting

Nick Devlin December 12, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
The way you describe it sounds like its planting roots

Nick Devlin December 12, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
into the person

Nick Devlin December 12, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
and growing out of hey're chest

Nick Devlin December 12, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
THEY ATE THE WATERMELON SEED

Nick Devlin December 12, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
I always knew that's what happened

Nick Devlin December 12, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
wrong their -.-

Nick Devlin December 12, 2011 at 9:36pm EST
hate when that happens

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:36pm EST
kinda like that yeah

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:36pm EST
and yeah that general vicinity

Nick Devlin December 12, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
are you gonna have their face showing the pain

Nick Devlin December 12, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
cause that seems very difficult

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
the way it is in my head

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
exactly

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
that's why i need to think of an alternative

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
bc i'm not really good at drawing people in general

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
and

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
the person would have to be like

Nick Devlin December 12, 2011 at 9:38pm EST
another way to show pain might just to be making it as gory as possible

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:38pm EST
thrown back. like their head with their face up and their arms back

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:38pm EST
yk

Nick Devlin December 12, 2011 at 9:38pm EST
just watch a couple of the new Mortal Combat Finishers

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH6FuBiQxu4

Nick Devlin December 12, 2011 at 9:40pm EST
that should help with the agony

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:40pm EST
holy shit

Nick Devlin December 12, 2011 at 9:40pm EST
your welcome

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:41pm EST

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:41pm EST

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:42pm EST

Nick Devlin December 12, 2011 at 9:50pm EST

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:50pm EST

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:51pm EST

Nick Devlin December 12, 2011 at 9:51pm EST

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:52pm EST

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 9:53pm EST

Gaimans First Law: Picking up your first copy of a book you wrote, if theres one typo, it will be on the page that your new book falls open to the first time you pick it up.

Nick Devlin December 12, 2011 at 10:25pm EST
it applies to everything

Nick Devlin December 12, 2011 at 10:25pm EST
you can never fix it

Nick Devlin December 12, 2011 at 10:26pm EST

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 10:28pm EST

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 10:28pm EST

Nick Devlin December 12, 2011 at 10:44pm EST

Nick Devlin December 12, 2011 at 10:44pm EST
i just use google calander

Nick Devlin December 12, 2011 at 10:45pm EST

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 10:56pm EST
this britney spears song doesnt really fit for entertainment

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 10:56pm EST

Nick Devlin December 12, 2011 at 10:58pm EST
you can shorten music right?

Nick Devlin December 12, 2011 at 10:58pm EST
cause the beginning is irrelevent

Nick Devlin December 12, 2011 at 10:58pm EST
but the song is good for entertainment

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 11:00pm EST
there's this black slide at the end of my thing

Steph Dudak December 12, 2011 at 11:00pm EST

Running couldnt help her, hiding would be even worse. No one would answer a cry for help on a night like this, in a town like hers; even if she did have the breath to try screaming. There was no escape. She desperately dashed down alleys, looking for something, anything that could prove her fears wrong. He followed closely behind, enjoying the chase, not willing to let things end so quickly. She ran for what felt like hours until, finally, she found something to give her a glimmer of hope. At the edge of a path, on the outskirts of an open field lay a shovel, half buried in the grassy soil. Perhaps she could defend herself and fight back, there was little chance of her winning, but a slim chance was better than none. She rapidly struggled to pull the shovel up out of the earth, but it was caught on something. There was no time to dig it up. She started to give up her last desperate attempt, and begin to just run until she collapsed, but the shovel suddenly came free, along with the arm of its previous owner. The owner soon followed out of the ground. She was too stunned to move. The man chasing did not even react to this new competitor opposing him in the game of terrifying the woman. He simply slowed down preparing to end the hunt. As he drew closer, so too did the owner of the shovel. Far too, late the hunter realized he was one rung lower on the food chain than he thought, as he was battered senseless with the shovel. The decaying face turned towards the mans prey, its moldering countenance showing no emotion as it brought down the shovels blade over her skull. The corpses immediately began sinking down in the muck, while the shovel and its owner returned to the earth to join both predator and prey in the realm of the ultimate hunter.

Short horror stor

Nick Devlin December 14, 2011 at 10:54pm EST
I'm willing to accept major changes to plot/ twists as well

Nick Devlin December 14, 2011 at 10:54pm EST
but i mainly just need a stupid check

Steph Dudak December 14, 2011 at 10:54pm EST
Will do

Steph Dudak December 14, 2011 at 11:00pm EST
She was too stunned to move. It's not that this doesn't make sense. I just don't really like the word stunned here that much. Far too, late Why is there a comma? But I like it

Nick Devlin December 14, 2011 at 11:02pm EST
hmm stunned can be changed

Nick Devlin December 14, 2011 at 11:02pm EST
i like the word petrified

Nick Devlin December 14, 2011 at 11:02pm EST
it feels like its fit

Nick Devlin December 14, 2011 at 11:02pm EST
but I need a completely different sentence

Nick Devlin December 14, 2011 at 11:02pm EST
to mke it not sound like i used a thesaurus or somethin

Steph Dudak December 14, 2011 at 11:03pm EST
Something along the lines of being petrified just by the sight of him

Steph Dudak December 14, 2011 at 11:03pm EST
Idk

Nick Devlin December 14, 2011 at 11:07pm EST
working on it

Nick Devlin December 14, 2011 at 11:08pm EST

Nick Devlin December 14, 2011 at 11:14pm EST
She lay strewn on the ground, petrified at the sight of his mutilated figure .

Nick Devlin December 14, 2011 at 11:14pm EST

Steph Dudak December 14, 2011 at 11:17pm EST

them

Nick Devlin December 15, 2011 at 4:24pm EST
i'm guessing you're being sarcastic

Nick Devlin December 15, 2011 at 4:24pm EST
...i hope

Nick Devlin December 15, 2011 at 4:25pm EST
maybe its sarcastic sarcasm

Nick Devlin December 15, 2011 at 4:25pm EST
making it truth

Nick Devlin December 15, 2011 at 4:25pm EST
...

Nick Devlin December 15, 2011 at 4:25pm EST

Steph Dudak December 15, 2011 at 4:27pm EST
Duh

Nick Devlin December 15, 2011 at 4:27pm EST

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 4:32pm EST

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 4:32pm EST

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 4:32pm EST

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 4:33pm EST

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 4:33pm EST

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 4:33pm EST

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 4:37pm EST
jeremy irons is the best narrator ever

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 4:37pm EST

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 4:39pm EST
ddkkssgjgj oommgg ddoo yyoouu sseeee tthhiiss

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 4:39pm EST

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 4:39pm EST
yes there were two letters

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 4:39pm EST
...

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 4:39pm EST
how did that happen askdglsfjhf

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 4:39pm EST
why?

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 4:40pm EST
because i didn't do it on purpose

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 4:40pm EST
that's odd

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 4:42pm EST
i know right

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 4:42pm EST
that guy is a lovely narrator btw

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 4:42pm EST

that is pretty

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 4:48pm EST
and the twin thing is already known

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 4:48pm EST
but still interesting

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 4:49pm EST
i'm not really sure why i sent that one lol

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 4:49pm EST
probably the expression on the white kids face

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
that is worth reblogging

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 4:55pm EST
how do you suppose

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 4:55pm EST
i'd be able to achieve a hollow person through a drawing

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 4:55pm EST
make it transparent

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 4:55pm EST
or a cutout

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 4:56pm EST
i was thinking of doing something like that for lonliness

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 4:56pm EST
maybe a blank facial expression. or you know, no facial features at all

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 4:56pm EST
and either you can see into the person, kinda like the brain one, or part of em is open

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 4:56pm EST
idk

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 4:57pm EST
have something with the eyes

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 4:57pm EST
or

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 4:57pm EST
http://www.usgs.gov/visitors/images/earthshells.gif

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 4:57pm EST
i was thinking that

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 4:57pm EST
but it wouldn't work with loneliness

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 4:58pm EST
Maybe you could use the environment to help depict this emotion

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 4:58pm EST
none of your previous ones really included anything but the main subject

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 4:59pm EST
i don't think it should be a generic barren landscape or something

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 4:59pm EST
but using something besides the actually person makes loneliness seem feasible

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 4:59pm EST
I always say actually instead of actual

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:00pm EST
i don't know why

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:00pm EST
but it always happens

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:00pm EST
i know

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:00pm EST
but

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:00pm EST
idk. i'm not really sure how i'd do that. cause like thinking about loneliness, it's easy for very generic things to come to mind

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:01pm EST
i'm not gonna do like a person curled up in a ball around a tree

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:01pm EST
what do you think of that is lonely?

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:01pm EST
annnnd loneliness has to control the person

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:01pm EST
I tend to think of space

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:01pm EST
yeah

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:01pm EST
like giant black holes and shit

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:01pm EST
and it is controlling the person

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:01pm EST
your environment pretty much makes up like 80% of who you are

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:02pm EST
and a lack of people in your environment

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:02pm EST
etc, you can explain away the controlling thing

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:03pm EST
hm

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:05pm EST

how you can see into them, but then there's the outside

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:06pm EST
all that'd be empty of course

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:08pm EST
http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ls4xxrEtj41qeardzo1_500.jpg this without other people or a heart

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:09pm EST
that works

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:10pm EST
you'd need some kind of weird light source though

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:10pm EST
oh wait

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:10pm EST
this is art

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:10pm EST
you can make light whereever the hell you want

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:10pm EST

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:11pm EST
what if the person faded into the background

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:11pm EST
like they'd be all open and empty and not happy and stuff

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:11pm EST
and going toward the bottom they started to fade

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:12pm EST
ahh idea almost in my head

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:12pm EST
ummm

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:12pm EST
there are lost of people in some area

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:12pm EST
but his head is completely empty

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:13pm EST
the entire thing forms his body

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:13pm EST
like to show that he looks like he is involved but even with tons of people his mind is still lonely

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:21pm EST
Wait the people form the person what

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:25pm EST
sorry

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
let me elaborate

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
You know how you can have like scenes of a city or something

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
that form a larger picuter

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
of someones face or an animal or something

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:27pm EST
well you'd have that

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:27pm EST
but he persons body would be full of people

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:27pm EST
and the head would be empty and desolate

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:28pm EST
hm

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:28pm EST
i understand the idea

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:29pm EST
but i feel like i wouldn't want people in it. like in the person and then just have the head be empty.

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:30pm EST
if the people surrounded the person or made an outline of a person, i feel like the idea would get across better, but idk how i'd make that work well either. like without being really lame

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:30pm EST
but also

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:30pm EST
what if i did like an environment without an actual environment...

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:31pm EST
like, have the sense of people being all around this empty person in the background, & maybe make eyes obvious or something. but then have this person without open eyes, and you can see the emptiness inside of them

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:31pm EST
i'd want the person to lack color and the background to be colorful but i feel like that'd make you focus on the background a lot more kinda. but then again that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing depending on how it's executed

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:32pm EST
especially if i went with that fading into the background thing but idk about that

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:32pm EST
i like that idea

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:32pm EST
cause that might work, plus it'd be easier for me to do and probably allow me to get it done with the time restraint i have cause i've been uninspired all weekend sooooo :p

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:33pm EST
plan made

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:33pm EST
time to execute

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:33pm EST
then constantly doubt yourself

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:33pm EST
because your crazy

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:33pm EST
hahaha you know me so well

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:33pm EST
i love that you put up with me

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:35pm EST
haha put up with you?

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:35pm EST
I'm suprised you even talk to me to tell the truth, but if that's how you see it

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:35pm EST
then your very welcome for me being such an awesome person

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:35pm EST
to put up with you

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:36pm EST
oh nicholas. you're a nut job

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:36pm EST
so face or no face

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:37pm EST
manekin face

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:37pm EST

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:38pm EST

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:39pm EST
there it is

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:39pm EST
without tophat and moncle

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:39pm EST
obviously

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:39pm EST
but have the eyes like shadowed

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:39pm EST
but not actually there

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:40pm EST
yeahh that's exactly what i meant

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:42pm EST
i'm suprised i have that picture online actually

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:42pm EST
glad it finally came in useful

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:44pm EST
fabulous

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:44pm EST
so colored background or no? cause i kinda wanna do it colored

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:44pm EST
just cause i like color

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:47pm EST
I think it should be very colourful

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:47pm EST
then become muted as it gets nearer him

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:47pm EST
that way it can still stand out somewhat

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 5:47pm EST

better pic of faceless guy

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:57pm EST
nice

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:57pm EST
& hmm alright

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:57pm EST
as in like

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 5:57pm EST
hold on

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:01pm EST
http://i39.tinypic.com/34dlxc2.png like that? lol that's an awful representation. like the outsides are really colorful and it gets less colorful as it goes in oor

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:01pm EST
THAT

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:01pm EST
turn it in

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:01pm EST
do it

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:02pm EST
don't even add anything else

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:02pm EST
its perfect

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:02pm EST
XD

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:03pm EST
or?

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:03pm EST
the oor was if that was not what you were talking about

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:04pm EST
well not as big as that obviously, I almost feel like it'd be interesting to make som other people more central

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:04pm EST
as in size

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:04pm EST
but have the colour leech away around him so he's still noticed

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:10pm EST
here

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:11pm EST
http://i551.photobucket.com/albums/ii472/dravarian26/loneliness.png

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:11pm EST
i made it in your style

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:12pm EST
hahahaha

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:13pm EST
i was gonna say

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:13pm EST
it'd make more sense for the lonely person to be the focal point

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:13pm EST
but

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:13pm EST
it would also make sense for the person to be more offset

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:13pm EST
reinforces the emotion

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:13pm EST
thats what i was thinking

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:15pm EST
that's if i put actual people in

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:15pm EST
damn it

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:15pm EST
i'd have to actually draw people

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:16pm EST
i was wondering when we'd hit that roadblock

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:16pm EST
maybe

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:16pm EST
you could

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:16pm EST
make them very... blurry?

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:16pm EST
i mean colorful and vibrant

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:16pm EST
but with no detail

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:16pm EST
but obviously there

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:16pm EST
like how the lonely man must see them

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:17pm EST
YES

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:17pm EST
you are a genius

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:17pm EST
hm... should i do this partially in chalk pastel then?

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:18pm EST
like the lonely person can be in pencil... the people could be in chalk pastel... and then maybe colored pencil as well? oh my head hold on

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:19pm EST
now i have to picture all this colored and such

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:21pm EST
should the basic background be black then

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:22pm EST
i have no idea

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:22pm EST
cause then i can have the colored blurry people

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:22pm EST
the grey lonely person

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:22pm EST
also fading into that black background

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:22pm EST
oh my goodness gracious i hope i can execute this properly

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:22pm EST
it could be really awesome

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:23pm EST
or really not awesome

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:23pm EST
sounds pretty awesome to me

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:24pm EST
ah it always SOUNDS awesome

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:24pm EST
now comes the challenge of making it look awesome

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:24pm EST
but that's one project down!

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:24pm EST
basically

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:25pm EST
now i gotta try to think of another one and maybe try to work simultaneously on them (lolol)

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:26pm EST
rage, SERENITY

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:26pm EST
okay i had an idea for that the other day

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:26pm EST
idk if i wrote it down in my sketch book

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:26pm EST
all i know is it'd be purple and blue

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:26pm EST
you want both of those?

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:28pm EST
not in the same piece

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:28pm EST
serenity for one, rage for another

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
hmm i'm thinking serenity might need a contrasting background as well

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
to emphasize the actual emotion

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
i can also do like

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
focus on a design aspect of that one

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
unless you can think of a way

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
more patterns?

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
curcy wavy stuff

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
the only thing that is currently coming to mind is kind of like

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
yes

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
swirly

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
pretty calm patterns

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:30pm EST
i can see that

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:30pm EST
but like the piece itself is like ~already been done. what's in my head. one sec

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
right so the first idea that just pops into my head is someone meditating. maybe around trees and stuff. but everything would have a design

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
but i feel like that's kinda like

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
oh

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
yeah

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
person meditating. serenity. derp.

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
that's where the contrasting background might help maybe?

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
have someone doing something peaceful

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
chaos

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
in the background

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
meditating gardening

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
and yes

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
have there be like a storm looming

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
with crazy patterned clouds and lighting

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
and harsh rain

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:35pm EST
with an aura of calm around them

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:35pm EST
This time the person in your drawing actual is controlling their emotion instead of the other way around

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:37pm EST
hmmmmmmm

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:38pm EST
that'd still fit the theme technically cause if you look at it from the emotion controlling the person perspective, it's like. no matter what's going on, that's still what you're feeling. it's taking over you and you're not worrying about other things that are going on

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:38pm EST
~ so deep

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:38pm EST
exactly

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:46pm EST
my god

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:46pm EST
now i know why i tag most of the things i reblog

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 6:48pm EST
i was trying to find this really awesome picture of a tree. it was like a drawing or painting. but it was made up of these colorful swirly patterns and such. either in september or october i reblogged it. but i didn't tag it! so i can't find it and safari decided to refresh the page while i was goin through the sept archive

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 6:48pm EST
that's annoying

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 7:02pm EST
http://owni.eu/files/2011/12/xkcd_map_projection.png

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 7:02pm EST
hahaha

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 7:02pm EST
I feel like i'm gonna get into maps now

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 7:03pm EST
My iPod isn't letting me zoom up on that

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 7:03pm EST
that sucks its pretty funny

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 7:07pm EST
I'll look at it eventually.

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 7:07pm EST
So fen hasn't emailed me back

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 7:12pm EST
annoying

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 7:31pm EST
I know! Ugh

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 7:47pm EST
You should stalk her on facebook then track down her house

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 7:47pm EST
knock on her door

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 7:47pm EST
then hand her the letter

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 7:47pm EST
orr

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 7:47pm EST
just ask for her real adress and mail it

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 7:47pm EST
either one

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 7:49pm EST
._.

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 7:53pm EST
How quickly do you suppose mrs Applegate could get a letter done lol fuck me man

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 7:54pm EST
maybe before the end of the week if you give it to her tomorrow

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 7:55pm EST
That'd be perfect. RPI wants a letter preferably from a math or science teacher that ~knows you well and i can't wait on mrs fenwick

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
I am not positive about that of course but it seems reasonable

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 7:57pm EST
If I ask her to try to get it done really really soon maybe lol

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 7:59pm EST
maybe

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 7:59pm EST
maybe if you went to juggling club more often

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 7:59pm EST
she'd get it done sooner

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 8:00pm EST
I should start going to those lol I'm sorry. I just never have a way of getting home

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 8:01pm EST
you don't have a late bus?

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 8:02pm EST
I've never taken the late bus o.o

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 8:03pm EST
because?

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 8:07pm EST
Idk cause I haven't ever

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 8:08pm EST
well thats a good readon

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 8:08pm EST
and julie or kerry show up sometimes

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 8:08pm EST
they give rides

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 8:09pm EST
Yeah but I constantly depend on them for rides and I'm not aware of when they stay after

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 8:12pm EST
yeah, I have the option (shitty option) to walk when they aren't there. Along with being acquaintances with 80% of the people that drive makes it easier to get rides

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 8:12pm EST
you should try sucking up to more people

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 8:12pm EST
especially people with cars

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 11:10pm EST
your tumblr friend said he likes my sugar glider

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 11:10pm EST
Which one

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 11:10pm EST

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 11:11pm EST

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 11:11pm EST

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 11:14pm EST
Like the fuck who is naming these people

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 11:14pm EST
Genevieve I don't find weird

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 11:14pm EST
I've heard it before and it's like French do

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 11:14pm EST
So

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 11:15pm EST

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 11:16pm EST
josh, laura, becca, ashley, anthony, kevin

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 11:16pm EST
i don't know people with weird names like that

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 11:16pm EST
at least not in the first ten people on facebook

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 11:17pm EST
Touché

Steph Dudak December 18, 2011 at 11:17pm EST
Normal named people live here

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 11:18pm EST
I'm still trying to find people with weird names

Nick Devlin December 18, 2011 at 11:18pm EST

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 2:42pm EST
which i originally converted it after i realized i didn't

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 2:43pm EST

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 2:53pm EST

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 2:54pm EST

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 10:56pm EST

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 10:56pm EST

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:01pm EST
i can tell

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:01pm EST
your joy eminates from the screen

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:04pm EST
i know. excitement and happiness radiate from my very being much like the warmth of the sun on a wonderful summer day.

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:04pm EST
precisely

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:06pm EST
oh warm sun

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:07pm EST
that reminds me

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:07pm EST
Visone said I could turn in the dinosaur story whenever

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:07pm EST
of course she did

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:07pm EST
that'll give you time to actually make it rhyme

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:08pm EST
hehe

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:09pm EST
that'll give you time to actually make it rhyme

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:09pm EST
and I will research pop up books, I doubt I'll do it though

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:13pm EST
you should try

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:14pm EST
I really should, Its annoying to have good ideas in that class

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:14pm EST
its not like i'll get a better grade if I go that above and beyond

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:15pm EST
but if I make it a real project I could put it in a portfolio...

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:15pm EST
do it

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:15pm EST
you don't have a choice

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:16pm EST
i'm telling you. i'm your conscience

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:16pm EST
and/or anything else you'd actually listen to. you might as well

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:17pm EST
yeah, I'll research stuff now

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:18pm EST
then when i get home i won't have an excuse not to start

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:20pm EST
there ya go

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:21pm EST

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:21pm EST

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:21pm EST
hows your art going?

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:22pm EST
its going

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:22pm EST
and by going

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:22pm EST
i mean going nowhere

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:22pm EST
i haven't done anything today. i don't plan on doing any tomorrow or the next day either really. no actual work anyway

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:23pm EST
well think of stuff then

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:23pm EST
how many more projects do you need to have done?

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:24pm EST
a million basically

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:27pm EST
literally

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:27pm EST
I am more concerned about

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:28pm EST
8 i think

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:28pm EST
7

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:28pm EST
more

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:29pm EST
i gotta redo that butterfly glass hand one thing so i guess 8. including that i have 3 ideas. i need to actually think about 5.

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:30pm EST
you need 8 more projects, you have 3 ideas so far?

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:30pm EST
just to clarify everything you just said

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:30pm EST
basically yeah

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:30pm EST
yes

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:30pm EST
not basically

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:30pm EST
yes

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:30pm EST
that is what i said, just in simpler terms, as if i weere paying any attention to what i was writing

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:31pm EST
so 5 more amazing ideas...

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:32pm EST
have you thought about sleep?

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:32pm EST
tired

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:32pm EST
something along that one?

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:32pm EST
im too tired to get up

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:32pm EST
wait

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:32pm EST
-.-

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:32pm EST
do you mean for a project

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:32pm EST
yes

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:32pm EST
or actually sleeping

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:32pm EST
oh

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:32pm EST
you gotta be pretty specific

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:33pm EST
you obviously just proved my point that lack of energy is a very controlling feeling

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:33pm EST
i'm actually getting sicker i think, now i have this awful cough but anyway

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:33pm EST
yes

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:33pm EST
exactly

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:33pm EST
look at that, personal experience portrayed through artwork somehow

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:34pm EST
that should be your next few projects

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:34pm EST
My art is Laziness

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:34pm EST
I'll didn't actually start it

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:34pm EST
but I think it's much more apt that way

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:34pm EST
A+ please

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:35pm EST
my concentration is the progression of an ambitious lazy person

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:36pm EST
it starts off alright, tons of ideas, but then

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:36pm EST
life

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:36pm EST
can't be bothered to force myself to be creative

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:36pm EST
thus can't think of not lame ideas

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:36pm EST
therefore nothing gets put onto paper,

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:36pm EST
and i leave things til the last minute --- > procrasination

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:37pm EST
which leads to some awful scribbles and even less sleep

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:37pm EST
which ultimately results in my downfall

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:37pm EST
autobiography or what you're project will be?

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:38pm EST
partially my autobiography and my entire concentration for art

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:38pm EST
#winning

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:38pm EST
nice multitasking there

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:39pm EST
so a project on tiredness

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:39pm EST
there is definately a word for that that I can't think of

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:39pm EST
not lazy

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:39pm EST
by without energy

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:39pm EST
irrelevant

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:40pm EST
do something with a dream bubble

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:40pm EST
some guy dreaming of cleaning his room

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:40pm EST
while in his pigsty of a room

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:40pm EST
or something equally ridiculous

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:41pm EST
i"iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:41pm EST
sorry

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:41pm EST

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:41pm EST
that never happened

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:41pm EST
i will

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:41pm EST
what never happened?

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:41pm EST
good kid

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:43pm EST
any ideas?

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:43pm EST
the only thing i relate tired with

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:43pm EST
is near death

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:44pm EST
these days anyways, especially this week

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:46pm EST
eyes just falling outta sockets, the skin underneath them sagging. swaying side to side, mouth slightly open, probably drooling. that's basically somewhere in between the transition of human to zombie

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:47pm EST
you should make your teme human anatomy or something

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:47pm EST
that's what you always seem to go for

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:48pm EST
or at least the disfiguration of it

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:49pm EST
the only thing that's keeping me from my concentration being that is the specific things

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:50pm EST
going on in the picture. like i can't really explain it

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:50pm EST
the pieces kind of have to include that stuff if it's control of emotion/feeling over a person.

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:50pm EST
depending on what's actually going on, having them disfigured makes it potentially more effective

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:51pm EST
i'd love to do an actual anatomy study though

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:51pm EST
eventually

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:51pm EST
I suppose it certainely makes them more noticeable

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:51pm EST
and anatomy is interesting

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:51pm EST
I'd like to learn how to scientifically draw nature stuff

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:52pm EST
animals and plants and junk

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:52pm EST
i suppose that include humans

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:53pm EST
i think also

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:53pm EST
if i had a better understanding of human anatomy, it'd be easier to distort it

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:53pm EST
you have to know the rules in order to break them

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:55pm EST
exactly. unfortunately it takes a bit of time to learn those rules

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:56pm EST
not enough time to do that and get your projects done

Steph Dudak December 23, 2011 at 11:56pm EST
exactly

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:57pm EST
I feel the same about coding, its just that I do have the time

Nick Devlin December 23, 2011 at 11:57pm EST
I just waste it

Steph Dudak December 24, 2011 at 12:00am EST
i don't know where time goes

Nick Devlin December 24, 2011 at 12:00am EST
nowhere it stays where it is

Nick Devlin December 24, 2011 at 12:00am EST
we just keep passing through it

Steph Dudak December 24, 2011 at 12:10am EST

Nick Devlin December 24, 2011 at 12:15am EST
Escher is awesome

Nick Devlin December 24, 2011 at 12:16am EST

Nick Devlin December 24, 2011 at 12:16am EST

Steph Dudak December 24, 2011 at 12:20am EST

Nick Devlin December 24, 2011 at 12:22am EST
life would be a lot more fun

Steph Dudak December 24, 2011 at 12:23am EST

Nick Devlin December 24, 2011 at 12:24am EST
it would be fantastic if this game I am playing had a save button

Nick Devlin December 24, 2011 at 12:24am EST
but it does not

Nick Devlin December 24, 2011 at 12:24am EST
so the past 4 hours

Nick Devlin December 24, 2011 at 12:24am EST

Nick Devlin December 24, 2011 at 12:24am EST

fuck

Steph Dudak December 25, 2011 at 10:38pm EST
hold on imma try to make it short

Nick Devlin December 25, 2011 at 10:38pm EST
go as much exposition as you need

Steph Dudak December 25, 2011 at 10:42pm EST
so. basically this kid mason (that i am NOW no longer friends with). like i was friends with him last year starting like two summers ago k. basically what had happened was some stuff happened, we hit this ridiculous fucking bullshit patch during spring break last year. and he basically ended our friendship right there. i tell you about that? well either way, i was pretty upset. but then i got over it. and like a month or so later he texted me all i miss my best friend blahblahblah. because i'm not a complete asshole, i was like. yo. i never went anywhere i offered to stay friends with you and you never answered me. but yeah so we kinda became friends again but it was kinda awkward at the same time. he doesn't even fucking live here man. but anyway. so. yeah and he's very ~pity me.

Steph Dudak December 25, 2011 at 10:42pm EST
one of those kinds of people. and doesn't listen to me when i try to give him advice so eventually i gave up. but we didn't talk nearly as often as we used to. so he also has this thing where. he and his girlfriend are pretty trashy people. and he can get away with goin like "hey skank" to her and she'll say whatever back. but shit like that does not fly with me. not at all. i find it rude and annoying, don't care if you're kidding or not. like if it's random once in a while, whatever. but if it's like all the time. fuck you. so he tries to get away with talking to me like that. but recently we haven't been like bad or anything. so there's a little back story which leads up to today.

Steph Dudak December 25, 2011 at 10:43pm EST
this morning. i texted a buncha people merry christmas cause. idk thats just what i do. so at about 9 am i texted mason merry christmas. wanna know how the conversation went? it's a really great conversation, really.

Steph Dudak December 25, 2011 at 10:45pm EST
so it started off with me being all Merry Christmas! and then he goes Fuck off Okay asshole I hate Christmas so much. Omg. That doesn't give you an excuse to be a douchebag. Hope you have a good day anyway, bye. K so like i said that was at about 9AM. At about 9PM he texted me back and goes Sorry bout earlier. Its whatever

Steph Dudak December 25, 2011 at 10:45pm EST
---- and i hate when people say that to me. so i only say that when i'm kinda pissed off myself. so he goes.. Don't get pissy I didn't mean anything by it DON'T GET PISSY?! DON'T FUCKING GET PISSY. LOL. OK. So I texted him back saying I think I have the right to be a little pissy. How did you expect me to react? And what do you mean you didn't mean anything by it? Idk if your friends let you talk to them like that, but I don't deal with that bullshit. Being nasty to me and telling me to fuck off just cause i said merry christmas to you does not fucking fly. I'm not gonna be treated like that. So don't tell me not to get pissy~.

Steph Dudak December 25, 2011 at 10:45pm EST
So he replies. Shut up So i'm like lol k i'm done. fuck you, don't fucking talk to me anymore. "Cool story." ALRIGHT. Like what the fuck ? sorry i said merry christmas to you like .... are you fucking kidding me right now? NEVER in my entire life has anyone been so rude and disrespectful. never. so i'm done. he's completely officially deleted out of my life, this time for good, cause i shouldn't have to deal with that bullshit.

Nick Devlin December 25, 2011 at 10:47pm EST
sounds like a douche

Nick Devlin December 25, 2011 at 10:47pm EST

Steph Dudak December 29, 2011 at 11:35pm EST
Yessir!

Steph Dudak December 29, 2011 at 11:35pm EST

Steph Dudak December 29, 2011 at 11:35pm EST
My desk is covvvvered with stuff

Steph Dudak December 29, 2011 at 11:35pm EST
And my eraser hasn't gotten lost XD

Nick Devlin December 29, 2011 at 11:35pm EST
that is unheard of!

Steph Dudak December 29, 2011 at 11:36pm EST
It really is. Mind you I have like three erasers on my desk rn but if I was working on my bed, I'd be searching every other second

Nick Devlin December 29, 2011 at 11:36pm EST
efficiency

Nick Devlin December 29, 2011 at 11:37pm EST
My desk is useless I mainly use it as a massive storage area.

Nick Devlin December 29, 2011 at 11:38pm EST
the surface is wood so you can write on it cause the pencil gets cause in the grain

Nick Devlin December 29, 2011 at 11:38pm EST
-.-

Nick Devlin December 29, 2011 at 11:38pm EST
annoying

Steph Dudak December 29, 2011 at 11:38pm EST
Ugh that's awful I hate that

Steph Dudak December 29, 2011 at 11:38pm EST
Lol currently

Nick Devlin December 29, 2011 at 11:39pm EST
i can't imagine having the patience to make multiple drafts of something without it being on the computer

Steph Dudak December 29, 2011 at 11:40pm EST
Truthfully idk how I did it

Steph Dudak December 29, 2011 at 11:40pm EST
But I had to practice

Steph Dudak December 29, 2011 at 11:40pm EST
It had to be perfect on the final paper

Nick Devlin December 29, 2011 at 11:40pm EST
did you look up stained glass patterns for reference?

Nick Devlin December 29, 2011 at 11:40pm EST
or just make a cool design?

Steph Dudak December 29, 2011 at 11:41pm EST
I just did those myself lol. I looked up stained glass sculptures for reference for the frame. Didn't work too well. So I just said screw it and outlined everything in black

Steph Dudak December 29, 2011 at 11:42pm EST
I also decided against the shattering glass bc it's extremely difficult to duplicate and it looks better this way

Nick Devlin December 29, 2011 at 11:43pm EST
yeah I can imagine

Nick Devlin December 29, 2011 at 11:43pm EST
any ideas on the background?

Steph Dudak December 29, 2011 at 11:43pm EST
I was hoping that'd eventually come to me. I have no clue

Steph Dudak December 29, 2011 at 11:44pm EST
When do I ever lol

Nick Devlin December 29, 2011 at 11:44pm EST
pattern/ design or a scene?

Nick Devlin December 29, 2011 at 11:44pm EST
I don't think you've made any pieces with scenes

Steph Dudak December 29, 2011 at 11:45pm EST
I have not

Nick Devlin December 29, 2011 at 11:45pm EST
so making one for this might seem out of place?

Steph Dudak December 29, 2011 at 11:45pm EST
Actually they're all plain

Steph Dudak December 29, 2011 at 11:45pm EST
Minus the heart which I've yet to do

Nick Devlin December 29, 2011 at 11:55pm EST

Nick Devlin December 29, 2011 at 11:57pm EST

Nick Devlin December 29, 2011 at 11:58pm EST

Nick Devlin December 29, 2011 at 11:58pm EST

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 12:16am EST

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 12:23am EST

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 12:23am EST
maybe tomorrow

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 12:23am EST
its close enough to not being real work

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 12:23am EST
that i might do it

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 12:24am EST
Do your work Nicholas

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 12:24am EST
I'm saving lit for Monday

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 12:24am EST
Unless I kill myself before that

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 12:24am EST
what are you doing?

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 12:24am EST
And I'll hide all the fishbowls

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 12:25am EST
Hahahaha

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:12pm EST
STEPH

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:12pm EST
I ALMOST did work

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:12pm EST
I came like THIS CLOSE

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:12pm EST
then I stopped

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:15pm EST
some essay for a scholarship

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:15pm EST
The world of my generation revolves around technology. Every facet of our lives from education to entertainment has technology embedded in it. I love the influence technology has had on the way people do things. Its facilitates tasks in ways that were unimaginable just a few decades ago. This does not mean that current technology is perfect. One of the biggest issues people have with new devices is figuring out how to work them. How often do you here people complain about how they cant understand a new website they found, or that they cannot figure out how to work their new cell phone? Although technology can drastically improve the storage and transport of information the messages sent are often miscommunicated. I love to find new ways to communicate a message or idea through different mediumLater this will be done I swear

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 3:33pm EST
Sec

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 3:37pm EST
It* facilitates tasks. However, this doesn't mean blahblahblah. It's not completely necessary but I think it flows better with however. How often do you hear* people complain Add a comma after ... And transport of information*,* Good start I think though. But I feel like that last sentence should be the beginning of a new paragraph or something

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:38pm EST
yeah i just wrote for 5 minutes

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:38pm EST
then got so excited that i wrote something

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:39pm EST
that i stopped

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 3:39pm EST
Don't you love when that happens. I gotta start my art projects. Every time I get ready to do something, my dad tells me to clean the kitchen

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 3:40pm EST
Then I realized I had to eat. So I made a sandwich. Ik great story. I'm hesitant to start working but ik I have to. Gotta get more ideas out tho

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:41pm EST
what are you working on now?

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 3:43pm EST
Idk I haven't started yet! I still have the other two things. The loneliness and serenity ones. I wanna do what we talked about for the lonely one but I know how difficult it's gonna be and I'm pressed for time. I need to make these like. Not necessarily simple, but things i know I can accomplish. I suppose I'll be working on both or one of those today

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 3:44pm EST
The main deal for the serenity is the background. Then I gotta think of a few more things for other pieces

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:44pm EST
you're doing the faceless guy for loneliness right?

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 3:44pm EST
Yessir

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 3:44pm EST
I wanted to have him like opening himself Like superman lol but I feel like its kinda been done

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:45pm EST
well yeah

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 3:45pm EST
I mean there wouldn't be anything there. Maybe I could make it look like some weird swirling vortex of nothing

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:45pm EST
also done a looks cool

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:45pm EST
i really like the color sapping idea

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:45pm EST
but that would take a while

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 3:46pm EST
I like how all my projects are done in the same medium lol. I've done all of these in colored pencil minus the brain

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:46pm EST
the color sapping would work with something chlaky

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:46pm EST
or pastel

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:46pm EST
one of those smeary mediums

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 3:47pm EST
Chalk pastels..?

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 3:47pm EST
lol

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:47pm EST
nah that sounds completely irrelvant

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 3:47pm EST
What is color sapping

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:48pm EST
the lonely guy in black and white

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:48pm EST
with all the colorful people around him

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:49pm EST
and anthing near him loses its vitality

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 3:49pm EST
Well

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 3:50pm EST
What if I put him on the edge of the page

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 3:52pm EST
Annnd. Cause the other ideas are difficult to um I can't think of the word But so I wouldn't need to worry about it. The background would be the shapes of people. Almost like its transitioning to him. Like the left side starts off all colorful annnd as you go to the right it just gets duller and greyer til it's him. They wouldn't be aligned with him exactly but do yk what I mean? That's the only way I can get it to really work.

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:53pm EST
that sounds like it'd work

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:53pm EST
kind of like a scale

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:53pm EST
unless you want to just be all out lazy

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:53pm EST
and draw a happy scene

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:53pm EST
then just say

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:53pm EST
the lonely guy is at home cause he has no friends

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 3:54pm EST
Hahahaha genius

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 3:54pm EST
That'd actually be more work

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 3:54pm EST
This requires no facial features

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 3:54pm EST
No defined like muscles and stuff of the people

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 3:54pm EST
Just general shapes

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 3:54pm EST
Like auras

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 3:55pm EST
He's shedding his aura of happiness

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 3:55pm EST
Cause underneath he's depressed and lonely as hell

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 3:55pm EST
Boom.

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:56pm EST
gold

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:56pm EST
go do it

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 3:58pm EST
Ok ok I will. Look at this first tho I found it funny Off to art!

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 3:59pm EST
I love those

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 4:06pm EST
I still gotta think of a background for the one I did last night too don't let me forget

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 4:07pm EST
I'll pester you about it with multiple random ideas to you like one of them or think of one better

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 4:07pm EST
whenever you finish the section you are doing now

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 4:11pm EST
I appreciate that, thank you

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:15pm EST
I'm SORRY

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:15pm EST
what have you done?

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 6:16pm EST
Hold on

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 6:17pm EST
Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:18pm EST
if his face is featureless

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:18pm EST
you defined the eye too much

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 6:19pm EST
I don't know how to fix it. If I should just lighten the dark parts or make the eye shape that's in there darker

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 6:19pm EST
Right now it looks like a closed eye

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:19pm EST
lighten the dark parts

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:19pm EST
i know

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:19pm EST
that's why i said too defined

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 6:20pm EST
I know

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 6:20pm EST
Womp. Would that make it look more like there wasn't an eye there idk.

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:21pm EST
http://www.mcbrideslaw.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Faceless-politicians-be.jpg

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 6:21pm EST
When I was doing the mouth and nose and stuff. I kinda just erased the lines and smudged the graphite a lot till it looked like stuff could be there

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:21pm EST
featureless faces are easy

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:21pm EST
you only need like 2 smudgy spots

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 6:21pm EST
Underneath the eye

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 6:22pm EST
There shouldn't be much

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:22pm EST
no

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:22pm EST
there shouldn't

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:22pm EST
http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/image/planetary/mars/face.jpg

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:22pm EST
people see what they want to see

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 6:23pm EST
If I take away most of what is underneath and lighten up the top it would work a little better I think.

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:23pm EST
yep

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 6:25pm EST
Should I more or less take out that line for the side of the nose then

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:26pm EST
all you really should need

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:26pm EST
is a smudge under the nose

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:27pm EST
but if that isn't enough

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:27pm EST
shade half of the nose

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:27pm EST
in a shadow

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 6:28pm EST
I'll figure it out somehow

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 6:28pm EST
Thank you

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:28pm EST
there's tons of things online of faceless people

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:28pm EST
and no problem

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
good luck

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
I feel like for me it's difficult because it's simple

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
yeah it is

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
I don't do a lot of simple things. This kind of moves away from what I've been doing

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
i think you feel like simple is bad

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
like you didn't put enough effort into it

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
because you're insane like that

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 6:30pm EST
Subconsciously, that's probably exactly what I think lmao

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
just finish your faceless face -.-

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 6:36pm EST
WHAT IF I DID

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 6:36pm EST
One min

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 6:37pm EST
Think I'll redraw this one too. I'll be sending pictures later.

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 7:28pm EST
okay

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 7:29pm EST
Yeah this isn't working

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 7:30pm EST
well alright then

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 7:30pm EST
I just spent another hour and it came out worse the second time. Idk how that's even possible.

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 7:41pm EST
how long have you been working on this stuff today?

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 7:41pm EST
3 hours

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 7:42pm EST
acceptable

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 7:44pm EST
I might just scrap this idea in general. If I spend three hours and end up nowhere besides aggravated... I should've just left it how it was the first time and like. I don't even know. It still wouldntve come out very well. I suppose I'll go force some sort of creative ideas now. Talk to you later

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 7:45pm EST
good luck forcing creativity

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 7:45pm EST
i'm sure that will work out well

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 7:45pm EST
just ask if you need help with anything

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 7:45pm EST
Basically what AP art requires

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 7:46pm EST
or you want ideas for the background of your stained glass thing

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 7:46pm EST
They didn't mention that in the prerequisite though

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 7:46pm EST
that's always annoyin

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 7:47pm EST
I don't even want to give that a background. I'll probably give it a solid color otherwise there'll be too much going on

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 7:55pm EST
yeah i can see that

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
Not that ik what color to use

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
I can't use black

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
that's why i didn't ask

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
you've already used most of the palette

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
i think like blue is like

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
left*

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
Grey? I used that on the other green one

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 7:57pm EST
The colors of the hand contrast that of the butterfly. So I can't go with that idea

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 7:58pm EST
yeah i know

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 7:59pm EST
what is this one representing?

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 7:59pm EST
pain?

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 7:59pm EST
or did you change the theme

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 8:01pm EST
The hand one? Fragility. That's what it always was. And that's why the hand was gonna shatter but that's another thing that didn't work out. Bc of that my concentration has broadened to feelings I suppose instead of just emotion

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:01pm EST
yeah okay, i remember the shattering and how that was supposed to relate to the pain

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:01pm EST
but since you changed it to whole

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:01pm EST
i wondered what the idea was

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:02pm EST
and feelings does open up things enough

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:02pm EST
the only background i can see would be like a forest scene

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 8:03pm EST
Still couldn't be green

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 8:03pm EST
That requires more detail as well

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:03pm EST
i know

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:03pm EST
WHY DON"T YOU HAVE MORE TIME

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:04pm EST
your lack of time is messing up all my ideas!!

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:04pm EST
i'm gonna yell at your art teacher

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 8:04pm EST
/cry You should

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:04pm EST
that my glorious thoughts aren't becaoming tangible

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 8:04pm EST
I lost a week cause of me dying

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:07pm EST
i remember that week

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:07pm EST
i doubt you do though

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:07pm EST
i think your brain took vacation

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 8:08pm EST
I'm pretty sure I slept through that week of school

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 8:08pm EST
I think I slept almost every day in gym lol

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:09pm EST
not much different thatn last year then

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 8:11pm EST
Haha Thursday our whole class did Nooooothing. I slept on the floor all period. She was all y'all are unmotivated blahblahblah And she looked at me and I was like ME? And she's like all of you And I'm like psh I'm sick Nd seconds away from killing myself As if I'm gonna actually do anything.

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:14pm EST

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:20pm EST
I'm trying to practice

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:20pm EST
beginner computers are so not meant for beginners

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 8:21pm EST
XD. I'd offer to help you but I suck at chess. I wish that was something I was good at

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:21pm EST

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:21pm EST
then again

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 8:21pm EST
Not that I practice tho

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:22pm EST
^that one

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:22pm EST
anyone would be good at anything if they practiced well enough

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 8:22pm EST
Exactly Well almost anything

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:23pm EST
well maybe they would be able to breath underwater

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:23pm EST
but yeah almost anything

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:23pm EST
wouldn't*

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:23pm EST
i always forget to make my words negative

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:23pm EST
thus completely polarizing my statement

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:23pm EST
hate word usage

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 8:24pm EST
I know you day

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 8:24pm EST

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 8:24pm EST

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 8:40pm EST
I don't know if you'd really get loneliness from it.

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 8:41pm EST
You're welcome , that's what I'm here for

No but yk those annoying melted crayon on canvas things all over tumblr?

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:41pm EST
mhmm

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 8:44pm EST
Laurie mentioned that and how I could do something like that. A lonely silhouette with the colors all around. Then I had an idea to do the background up real big. So it'd be really colorful and swirly and pretty but where the silhouette is, it'd be grey. Then I thought, the grey part could just form the shape of a person in this pretty background BUT I dunno how well it'd work. Like of it'd just get lost yk? Cause I was thinking about it along the lines of the brain. How it's obvious, but not completely obvious

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 8:45pm EST
I really just think itd look cool more than anything But it'd have to fit

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:46pm EST
make a grey background

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:46pm EST
then outline a silloute

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:46pm EST
put in somewhere on paper

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:46pm EST
then drawin colorful pretty paterns to your hearts content

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:46pm EST
and remove the paper leving grey person behind

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 8:47pm EST
So like

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 8:47pm EST
Just a plain grey figure

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 8:47pm EST
Amongst pretty stuff

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
mhmm

Steph Dudak December 30, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
Hm

Nick Devlin December 30, 2011 at 8:50pm EST

Steph Dudak December 31, 2011 at 12:52am EST
Horahan

Nick Devlin December 31, 2011 at 12:52am EST

OUR PEERS

Steph Dudak December 31, 2011 at 12:54am EST

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 11:58am EST

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 11:59am EST
i haven't really done anything the last two summers.

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 11:59am EST

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 11:59am EST

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:00pm EST

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:00pm EST

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:00pm EST
that is indeed fantastic!

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:01pm EST
well keep up the good work then, i'm off to think of things to write in this other than "i didn't really do much but play wow and hang out"

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:02pm EST
make it sounds good then!

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:02pm EST
I played strategic games of combat

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:03pm EST
while not spending time with my contemporaries

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:03pm EST
in pursit of expanding my social growth

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:03pm EST
which tends to wane while playing the aforementioned strategic combat gamews

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:04pm EST
lol fabulous

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:05pm EST
yeah NJIT emails me like everyday and they just now decided to tell me my special application things deadline is january 15th so that makes 3 or 2

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:06pm EST

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:06pm EST

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:07pm EST
and click the send button on portfolio

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:08pm EST
very good idea sir. yeah i'm getting everything in by thursday the latest. application fees suck

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:08pm EST
my total so far is $150

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:08pm EST
i could use that money for so much stuff

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:08pm EST
important stuff

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:09pm EST
i think the only fee that i have waivered is the one for drexel

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:09pm EST
yep

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:10pm EST
I haven't even visited another school -.-

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:10pm EST
everything else is $70. lol i'm in the same boat. i've visited one college, and i'm not even applying there

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:13pm EST
which college?

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:16pm EST
arcadia

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:16pm EST
the one from like 2 years ago

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:16pm EST
where you got the shirt

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:16pm EST
yeep lol

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:16pm EST
it was a free shirt

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:17pm EST
now if the school itself had the same price tag

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:17pm EST
maybe you'd apply

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:17pm EST
they don't have an architecture major lol if any school had the same price tag, i'd be a happy camper

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:17pm EST
i'm debating on even applying to syracuse now

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:18pm EST
that's another $70 fee.

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:18pm EST
philadelphia university is 40

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:18pm EST
Maybe you should just find some school in like idaho where they practically beg people to apply

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:19pm EST
i know right lol

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:19pm EST
so. i don't think mrs morgan actually reads the things i hand in to her..

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:19pm EST
doubtful

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:19pm EST
i had to hand in a college essay a million years ago

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:19pm EST
and

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:19pm EST
hold on i'm gonna send you it

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:19pm EST
funfnu

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:19pm EST
i probably already have

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:20pm EST
its would make sense

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:21pm EST
To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. -- Ralph Waldo Emerson. Growing up, we are heavily influenced by the people around us. One main idea were given is we cant live happy, successful lives unless we get a job that will make us a lot of money. While money is an important factor of life, it is also important that you spend your life doing something you actually enjoy doing. It is important to follow your own path and see where it takes you. You only have one life to live; do what makes you happy. This is something I have considered in deciding my major in college. Ive always taken an interest in art and math which influenced me to take Introduction to Computer Graphics when I began high school, aside from my already developed interest in computer graphics as well. As a result of my enjoyment in this class, I took Advanced Computer Graphics junior year, along with regular art classes my sophomore, junior, and senior year, and am currently enrolled in an Architectural Design class. At the end of my Advanced Computer Graphics class, we started drawing floor plans in DataCad. It was at this point that I really knew I wanted to major in architecture because of how much fun I had creating the floor plans and elevation views. This year Im expanding on that knowledge and have begun drawing floor plans by hand. While it takes a while to do, the final product is worth it. Throughout high school, I have reconsidered multiple times my major choice for college but Im now sure of what I want to do. What I have also realized is I might have always known this. Since I was younger, I loved looking at houses and buildings while thinking of ideas for a future home of mine that I wanted to design myself. Living in a house that I designed has always been a dream of mine and I plan to do what it takes to make this dream come true. BUT ANYWAY. on the paper i printed out, that i also seem to have lost, she was all great job blahblahblah or whatevv. and only made some grammatical corrections that i currently do not recall. i wrote this like the day before it was due just to get it done.

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:21pm EST
i was definitely talking to you as i wrote this

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:21pm EST
yes yoou were

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:21pm EST
the wuote

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:21pm EST
quote*

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:21pm EST
i remember it

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:24pm EST
it's not even good

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:24pm EST
well I wouldn't say not good

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:24pm EST
but it is like

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:24pm EST
'for school'

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:24pm EST
like what you'd right to get something over with

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:25pm EST
it isn't even really finished lol. i kinda just ended it like that cause i was tired and didn't know what else to really say. but exactly. mrs morgan is no help

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:30pm EST
god damn it. rpi asks for a specific sat date. whyyy

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:30pm EST
aww

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:30pm EST
sorry

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:30pm EST
i did tell you i only got like 10 extra points

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:30pm EST
i saw that actually i'm sorry to hear that :|

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:31pm EST
which was totally worth the 60 bucks i wasted--i mean spent

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:31pm EST
absolutely wasted

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:31pm EST
oh shoot

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:32pm EST
nooot gonna send scores through collegeboard

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:32pm EST
how else can you send?

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:33pm EST
through the school

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:33pm EST
it seems

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:34pm EST
"I would like my test scores mailed with my application"

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:34pm EST
for free?

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:34pm EST
hmm if that's free I must try it

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:36pm EST
yeah. i feel like through collegeboard it's like, guaranteed they'll get it to them. but you need to pay for every school you're sending it to

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:36pm EST
which is again, ridiculous imo

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:39pm EST
30.50

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:39pm EST
if i want to send to 3 colleges

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:39pm EST
$10.50 to send scores to a school i might not even get into, on top of the however much i paid to take the test 3 times, well over $100, and on top of application fees. you know that's nearly $400.

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:40pm EST
how much did the SAT cost? wasn't it 49?

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:40pm EST
i missed the deadline for one of em

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:41pm EST
yep 49

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:41pm EST
i wonder where all that money goes

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:41pm EST
and it's like 75 if you miss the deadline

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:43pm EST
$173 for three tests $42 for sending the scores $180 for application fees $395 .......... idk but it better go somewhere real important

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:49pm EST
I say it should go to paying off my college debt

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 12:50pm EST
which is unlikely

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:51pm EST
highly

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 12:51pm EST
it should though

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 7:07pm EST
remeber that children's story i was going to fix?

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 7:07pm EST
Yeah I'm not

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 7:07pm EST
I'm just gonna draw some picture

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 7:08pm EST
Whatever gets the job done faster

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 7:08pm EST
And is sufficient enough

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 7:08pm EST
i was a bout to say

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 7:08pm EST
fastest way to do it

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 7:08pm EST
would be to turn in a couple lines on a paper

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 7:11pm EST
Mehhhh. Make it look a little decent

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 7:11pm EST
yeah i will be

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
i might include like one pop up drawing at either the 'climax' or the end

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 7:16pm EST
have you made progress on art shtuff?

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 7:16pm EST
or think of a background for stained glass

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 7:17pm EST
I've made no progress on anything cause I suck and like to stress myself out and make myself more miserable than I already am

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 7:17pm EST
At least, that's the only logical explanation

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 7:18pm EST
well its illogical

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 7:18pm EST
to do it

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 7:18pm EST
but it is normal for you

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 7:19pm EST
After I make my fucking bed cause no one cares what they do to my room after they sleep in it, I'll most likely be up all night doing stuff

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 7:19pm EST
Sleep probably won't be an option which sucks cause I'm fucking tired but

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 7:19pm EST
You know

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 7:19pm EST
Consequences

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 7:19pm EST
I'll learn eventually

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 7:19pm EST
i still haven't :(

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 7:20pm EST
stupid school keeps reinforcing the idea that doing less homework and procrastination does not effect my grade

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 7:20pm EST
and if it does, judging from my studies on my grades

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 7:20pm EST
their effect is positivr

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 7:21pm EST
Easy senior year man

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 7:21pm EST
By doing nothing you're doing something right

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 7:22pm EST
that is true

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 7:27pm EST
All I'm worried about this week is getting my art projects in and getting my NJIT and RPI stuff in by Thursday. That just requires me to think a little bit about what I'm gonna write for the little essay sections that aren't even essays. Minimum 250 word character things and why I'm choosing architecture as my career etc. Nothing I can't handle. I need to get a calendar

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 7:28pm EST
one of those giant ones?

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 7:28pm EST
that teachers have on their desks

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 7:28pm EST
Yeah that I can write everything I have to do on. Set up a schedule

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 7:28pm EST
Stick it on my wall

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 7:29pm EST
And use it from now til I don't need to give a fuck about school anymore

Nick Devlin January 1, 2012 at 7:29pm EST
only 5 more years

Steph Dudak January 1, 2012 at 7:31pm EST
Basically

Steph Dudak January 2, 2012 at 11:58pm EST
You're not awake are you adgjldsmkl

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 6:31am EST
Sorry, I attempted and failed to go to sleep at a reasonable time

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 6:31am EST
It was a very fun time staring at the wall for an hour and a half though

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 2:17pm EST
I went to bed at 4am. Where were you todayyy

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 3:12pm EST
i died

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 3:12pm EST
and left school

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 3:12pm EST
it sucked

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 4:44pm EST
That's awful o.o

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 7:56pm EST
then i came home and slept and died some more

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 7:56pm EST
die is a filler word for puke btw

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 7:56pm EST
anyway

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 7:57pm EST
how was lunch without me?

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 8:02pm EST
Aw poor nick ): Well let's see. The seat in front of me was empty lol. I worked for like five minutes on an art project that I still gotta finish but at least it's small. Actually I have to do four art projects still. But I got actual homework today which is unfortunate. I didn't get to rant to you today that's not fun. Morgan didn't collect the assignment we were supposed to do over break which is awesome bc I didn't really do it. Did you just like randomly get sick?

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:06pm EST
this morning actually, told my mom i didn't feel good drank some tea. Then I took like 3 steps out of the car and when she drove away i puked. I thought that was it, since like i didn't feel sick i just felt nauseous, so i went inside cleaned my face. Went to first period and listened to Kerry's zombie story where lindenmayer killed me. then i kinda ran to the bathroom

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:06pm EST
i gave up after that

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:06pm EST
and i missed your rant today

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 8:07pm EST
AW. That's awful. Are you feeling any better now?

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:07pm EST
yeah

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
i slept and sara came over and gave me crackers

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
and i watched tv

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
that helped a a lot

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:10pm EST
what was today's rant gonna be about?

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:10pm EST
just wondering

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 8:13pm EST
Oh no just today's events like usual. How we got morgan majorly off topic before having to take notes And how she didn't collect the assignment that I did attempt to do fourth and fifth period I was gonna show you my art projects too cause I had all of em with me. But yk. You weren't there so lol. I was going to spend lunch brainstorming ideas but that failed cause I got distracted cause I was discussing art in general with Laurie and Carly. And tori was extremely upset and I had like no clue what to say to her. Like I literally sat there and hugged her for five minutes while she sobbed into my shoulder/hair. So eventful period

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:16pm EST
sara said drama happened that she didn't understand.

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:16pm EST
was tori okay?

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:16pm EST
or at least improve

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 8:20pm EST
Not really. She was actually a wreck. She was saying how her dad was leaving and how it was basically all her fault bc of all the shit she's been doing that she shouldn't be. But that he's crazy himself and. I like can't even. But she needs help. I asked her if she's getting any and she said yeah but I don't really know what kind of help she's getting and if it's the right kind of help. But I don't think it's effective. She was sobbing and shaking like crazy. And Carly's mad at her at the moment too which is making tori even more upset. But Carly was telling me it's bc tori isn't listening to her and she's basically going out and wrecking herself when Carly's trying to tell her to stop that. And tori will say one thing and do another. Personally I don't know much about the situation in general and I can only go so much by what people tell me.

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 8:22pm EST
But I was talking to aja after cause tori left with Priscilla who apparently isn't a very good influence herself. And aja said she could try to talk to her but idk if she's gonna or anything. But I think she'd be easier for tori to relate to.

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 8:23pm EST
Whatever tori is doing now isn't working though. I mean she's aware of what she's doing to herself. But I think also in an attempt to cope she's making herself even worse.

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:23pm EST
priscilla isn't a bad influence but she isn't really posotive either

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 8:26pm EST
I don't talk to Priscilla cause I don't really know her. Aja was talkin about that though. How she's quite a drinker herself and how she won't really try to stop you from doing something. I don't remember her saying she necessarily encourages you. But you know. It was really depressing though cause while tori was trynna explain everything she's like. I guess it's kind of hard for someone to care about you if you don't even care about yourself.

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:26pm EST
very

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:27pm EST
tori has been texting me a lot lately

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:27pm EST
she's nice in words but the stories she tells make me worried about her

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 8:30pm EST
I just wish I could actually like. Do something to help her. But I don't ever really know anything to say or what to do other than just be there for someone. That's the worst part about it. Like. She isn't a bad kid. Like I mean if you take away all theshit she does and whatever. Kinda like she's not supposed to be like that. Do you know what I mean? Idk how to explain it. but yeah I am worried.

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:32pm EST
its worse because i've never actually seen the things she's done

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:32pm EST
like she shopwed up at my house a week or so back

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:32pm EST
at 1 am

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:33pm EST
my mom didn't wake me up

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:33pm EST
and asked tori if she needed help

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:34pm EST
tori left wandering around

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:34pm EST
ended up in a counselours house ssome how

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:35pm EST
idk

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 8:36pm EST
Oh god

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 8:37pm EST
Idk. She needs something though.

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:44pm EST
blegh

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
anywqay

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
art

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
what did you do so far?

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 8:48pm EST
This

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 8:49pm EST
There's two others one sex

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 8:49pm EST
Sec damn it

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 8:50pm EST
Dunno if you can really see the lines in the background. WIP

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 8:50pm EST
Same deal. I don't like the blue in this. Im hoping it'll look better once I go over it with a blending market

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 8:51pm EST
Market

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 8:51pm EST
M A R K E R mother fucker stop correcting me on words that exist

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 8:51pm EST
Part of that has no arrows though and imma color it like normal skin

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 8:56pm EST
So yep

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
haha this mini netbook took 15 minutes to loaqd the awesomeness of those pics

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:08pm EST
the lnely one looks really cool

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:09pm EST
:D that one took the shortest time ever. I kinda wanna redo it and make the color lines get straighter as they go to the left and take the shape of the person as you go more towards the right

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:09pm EST
what is the explanation for the rest

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:09pm EST
But well see. Cause I kinda like how the person came out

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:10pm EST
The arrow one is confusion. Even though it doesn't look much like it. Just looks kinda weird lol

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:10pm EST
The other is like a lava lamp person haha. That's my calm and relaxation one. Cause I feel calm and relaxed when I stare at lava lamps

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:11pm EST
Which is what I was doing at 2am when I came up with the idea

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:24pm EST
Ahh those more sense. The clown one creeps me out

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:25pm EST
What

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:26pm EST
The one the eyes and the mouth

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:26pm EST
Oohhh

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:28pm EST
Yeah but I can see all of those ideas now

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:31pm EST
Sweet. Yeah now I gotta think up 4 more ideas. And I think imma try to do em on paper the size of the lava lamp person cause it's small so it'll take less time

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:31pm EST
makes sense

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:35pm EST
Just haven't gotten that far yet lol

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:36pm EST
so you still need 4 ideas?

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:36pm EST
Which is bad since its already 9:30. What other emotions/feelings

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:36pm EST
ughh sickness

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:37pm EST
So you vomiting

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:37pm EST
Got it

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:37pm EST
Three to go

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:37pm EST
it'll be beautiful

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:37pm EST
hmm guardianship

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:37pm EST
like protection

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:37pm EST
watching over someone

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:37pm EST
I wanna do anger for one still FFFFFFFF. My heart one still needs a background. IDw give it one

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:37pm EST
you get the idea

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:37pm EST
ddo it and stop your complainin

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:38pm EST
did you do the serenity one yet?

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:38pm EST
peaceful; object in a raging environment

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:38pm EST
Actually a picture popped into my head yesterday of someone vomiting like spikey balls. Like that are at the end of a ball and chain weapon thing yk. Idk why tho No I didn't I tried and nothing was working out

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:39pm EST
what did you try drawing?

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:39pm EST
I like the heart one without a background though. I mean do I really *need* one

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:39pm EST
A few stupid things like the first idea I told you about the meditating whatever. Then I tried to draw a person into a flowy tree thing But No

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:43pm EST
hmm

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:43pm EST
did you try doing some kind of animal instead?

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:43pm EST
deer, bird, cat etc

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:43pm EST
Needs to be people

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:44pm EST
ughh

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:44pm EST
its a symbol

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:45pm EST
Serenity is the last thing I'm worried about bc I just did one having to deal with calmness and such

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
ahh

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
i see

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
ignore that one then

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
Anger I'll think of something for. Something that doesn't involve fire

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
don't want to be cliche?

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:47pm EST
Yep

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:47pm EST
have you thought of bottled anger?

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:47pm EST
like the kind oeople hold inside till they explode?

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:48pm EST
that would be more interesting

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:50pm EST
It's a shame I don't have paint. Cause I could do a person shown from the side and do something exploding out of it. Or i could do like a person with their skin peeling to reveal some angry looking thing and looking just normal on the outside

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
both of those work

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
i thought very literraly of somehow involving a bottle

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:52pm EST
I I did too at first actually

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:52pm EST
But I didn't develop an actual idea out of it

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:52pm EST
i just thought of a little ship in a bottle

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:52pm EST
which is irrelevant

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:52pm EST
except...

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:53pm EST
An angry monster trying to break outta the. Otter

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:53pm EST
P

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:53pm EST
Otter yeah

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:53pm EST
Bottle

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:53pm EST
Is what I thought of

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:53pm EST
stormy seas inside the bottle, held by a guy on a boat

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:53pm EST
kinda the opposite of that serenity one i thought of

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:54pm EST
too much detail i think

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:54pm EST
If I had enough time

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:54pm EST
I would try that

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:54pm EST
Cause that's a cool idea

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:55pm EST
Id have whatever's in the bottle escape though

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:55pm EST
I'd want to rather

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:55pm EST
yeah like it's cracked open with the storm rushing out

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 9:55pm EST
but better idea you have?

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:56pm EST
L

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:56pm EST
Not l

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 9:58pm EST
If cracked then rushing out the top of the bottle almost like a bomb just exploded. With dark purple storm clouds. And then like not cracked just like the cork was taken out and it was flowing out the neck of the bottle and whatnot. Tht reminds me of a genie bottle

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 10:00pm EST
i can see it

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 10:01pm EST
GAH I wish I had time to try that

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 10:02pm EST
so you need the simplest of simple to draw?

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 10:02pm EST
thats impossible because you hate simple

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 10:02pm EST
Not simple really

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 10:02pm EST
Just something that'd still be effective on a smaller piece of paper

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 10:02pm EST
just not detailed?

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 10:03pm EST
Detailed but it doesn't have to be to my usual extent

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 10:03pm EST
Like the lava lamp one still has a design aspect in it

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 10:03pm EST
And Im doing more with the color in the background

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 10:03pm EST
But it's not completely simple and not unlike something I'd do

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 10:04pm EST
so more design type peices

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 10:04pm EST
with patterns and colors to represent ideas

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 10:05pm EST
Which is generally what I do lol. Just at a smaller scale

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 10:05pm EST
I'm working on exactly half the size paper as normal

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
i'm still trying to think of a way to make guardianship work

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 10:08pm EST
I feel like that requires a bit of a situation

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 10:08pm EST
yeah i know which is why i keep trying to imagine protective symboils

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
armor, shells, walls

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
That makes me think of The guardian of ancient kings ability in wow various Pokemon and turtles And one of mr pecks force diagrams

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
Those words.like without thinking

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
Not that that's relevant

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 10:17pm EST
idk, just idea throwing

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 10:17pm EST
but when you said pokemon i thiough of eggs

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
which made me think of like fetuses

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
and how their protected by parent

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
its cliche

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
but you might do something with it

Nick Devlin January 3, 2012 at 10:32pm EST
good night, good luck

Steph Dudak January 3, 2012 at 10:32pm EST
Thanks, goodnight

Steph Dudak January 4, 2012 at 8:23pm EST
you aren't there. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT SUCKS? I'll tell you anyway. writing ~personal statements~. for my RPI app: Write a personal statement, in 250 words or more, about yourself ... be as creative as you like. just sayin. but my njit app is officially complete yaaay~ hope your day was just as fantastic

Nick Devlin January 4, 2012 at 11:17pm EST
you finished it?!

Nick Devlin January 4, 2012 at 11:17pm EST
funfun

Nick Devlin January 4, 2012 at 11:17pm EST
and I'm never here

Nick Devlin January 4, 2012 at 11:17pm EST
too many things to ignore and facebook makes me remember to do them

Nick Devlin January 4, 2012 at 11:18pm EST
like freakin scholarships government garbage

Nick Devlin January 4, 2012 at 11:18pm EST
I need to get on that

Nick Devlin January 4, 2012 at 11:22pm EST
also before i forget

Nick Devlin January 4, 2012 at 11:22pm EST
Eyes

Nick Devlin January 4, 2012 at 11:22pm EST
I need to find cool ones

Nick Devlin January 4, 2012 at 11:23pm EST
so far I've thought owls, cuttlefish, frogs, giant squid

Nick Devlin January 4, 2012 at 11:23pm EST
any other ideas?

Nick Devlin January 4, 2012 at 11:23pm EST
like cool cartoon eyes or something? I only know animals so that's why it's all I have

Steph Dudak January 4, 2012 at 11:24pm EST
Oh I was gonna say husky

Nick Devlin January 4, 2012 at 11:35pm EST
mmhm

Nick Devlin January 4, 2012 at 11:35pm EST
tthat was considered

Nick Devlin January 4, 2012 at 11:35pm EST
but huskies are mainly cool because of the colors in their eyes which are really nice, but in order to get that effect they have, I'd need to be able to create that color

Nick Devlin January 4, 2012 at 11:36pm EST
which with Art II supplies

Nick Devlin January 4, 2012 at 11:36pm EST
is not the simpleest task in the world

Steph Dudak January 4, 2012 at 11:37pm EST
Depends what you're usin

Steph Dudak January 4, 2012 at 11:37pm EST
If you useeee acrylic maybe

Nick Devlin January 4, 2012 at 11:41pm EST
maybe, I can mix paint pretty well, but I think I'd rather use that medium for something with more... vibrant? clashing? just more colors in general

Nick Devlin January 4, 2012 at 11:42pm EST
huskies just have that ice blue

Steph Dudak January 4, 2012 at 11:53pm EST
Yeah but of you do it right it'll come out real nice. But if you rajther it for a more vibrant section

Steph Dudak January 4, 2012 at 11:53pm EST
Um

Nick Devlin January 4, 2012 at 11:53pm EST
i can do more than one acryllic

Steph Dudak January 4, 2012 at 11:53pm EST
Do you know all the ones you want to use? Can you?

Nick Devlin January 4, 2012 at 11:54pm EST
pretty sure, i mean dishon won't like it, but i do what i want in that class, since I don't suck he's pretty much like yeah sure whatever you feel is best

Steph Dudak January 4, 2012 at 11:55pm EST
Lol we had to use a different medium for each thing. Is it that same project as last year or?

Nick Devlin January 4, 2012 at 11:59pm EST
we are doing detailed eyes, sketched eyeS, then a bunch of random eyes in different mediums of our choice, then a sort of final project of very detailed eyes, then 3 eyes of our choice

Nick Devlin January 4, 2012 at 11:59pm EST
as far as i know

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:00am EST
So the final project. Is your own human eyes. In pencil Followed by 3 others. in whatever

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:01am EST
mhmm

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:02am EST
So what other three did you want to do then?

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:05am EST
i haven't decided I am going to try all the animals along with any cool eyes i find on google

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:05am EST
then pick from the ones i like best

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:05am EST
because we finally get to make a rough draft then a final copy

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:06am EST
we haven't done that at all so far

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:08am EST
Well that's good then. That way at least you'll get a good idea of what you can do. Have you thought much about mediums yet?

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:08am EST
not at all

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:08am EST
until you mention acryllic husky

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:09am EST
The only thing is

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:09am EST
i'll definately have a coloured pencil because coloured pencils are godly

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:09am EST
god damn it definitely*

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:09am EST
You'd need to make the fur look like fur

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:09am EST
Colored pencils are wonderful

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:10am EST
All I use rofl. I want markers. Then I'll learn how to use em. Um. There's tempera too

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:10am EST
What have you used so far?

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:11am EST
in class we've done tempera paint for the portrait, normal pencil, coloured pencil, those stupid crayon smeary things that i despise, umm i think that's it really

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:11am EST
If I ask I could get him to let me use other mediums

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:11am EST
if i can think of any

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:11am EST
paper cutout?

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:12am EST
those are fun

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:12am EST
I like those

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:12am EST
Cray-pas womp h8 em

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:13am EST
I used those for my wolf though

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:13am EST
those are the less smeary chalk crayon things right?

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:13am EST
Pain in the ass. I never learn

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:13am EST
They're like crayons

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:13am EST
But softer

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:13am EST
More pastely

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:14am EST
Hence Cray pas

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:14am EST
Not chalky

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:14am EST
alright

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:14am EST
i see google showed me they're close to what i thought they were

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:14am EST
Cause they're like they're oil pastels

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:16am EST
I wonder if I coiuld use some kind of chalk?

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:17am EST
meh i really don't like chalk so i don't see why it matter nevermind

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:18am EST
Not fun for eyes

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:18am EST
eyes are really precise so it would be a nightmare

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:19am EST
Exactly. Chalk pastels are good for landscapes tho. Did you do that one yet?

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:19am EST
yeah i did an aurora borealis

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:20am EST
How'd it come out?

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:21am EST
meh, he didn't teach us how to use pastel so it's pretty...childish looking? idk just looks sloppy to me

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:22am EST
There isn't much to learn. Didn't he do a demonstration? lol

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:22am EST
i might've missed it i'm usually late to his class

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:22am EST
but he went over layering, like he does with every new item we used

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:23am EST
but the colours mixed terribly

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:23am EST
so i just made them all solid mostly

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:24am EST
Takes some practice I think. They can be a pain but something like that seems like it'd be perfect for chalk pastels

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:24am EST
It sounds like a good idea anyway. But it always does

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:25am EST
yeah that's the problem he didn't really let us practice, I understood the idea of how to use them about halfway through the piece, but our first try was final copy

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:25am EST
ALSO

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:25am EST
the DAY after I bring in my photo

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:25am EST
liek THIRTY damn people start doing auroras

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:25am EST
uncreative bastards

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:25am EST
think up your own genius ideas

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:26am EST
Ugh annoying

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:26am EST
Was yours just plain greens and such?

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:26am EST
mostly greens and yellows

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:27am EST
the aurora itself i can stand, but everything else is just messy and dirty and looks bad

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:28am EST
http://coolyourjetsyo.tumblr.com/tagged/northern+lights Yeah I gotcha

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:28am EST
Lol gotchu is in my auto correct

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:29am EST
that looks sweet as hell

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:29am EST
oh there's more

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:29am EST
Could've sworn I had more tagged but I guess not

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:29am EST
There's only like 5 there

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:30am EST
Either way they all look magnificent

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:31am EST
i used a screen cap from a video i liked

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:33am EST
you probably have a ton you just were too lazy to tag

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:33am EST
ughghhggh

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:33am EST

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:34am EST

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:34am EST
thanks for the help

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:34am EST
Have fun sleeping

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:34am EST
Not a problem

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:34am EST
have fun not sleeping because your insane

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:34am EST
and will most like turn literally insane in another day or two

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:35am EST
Probably lmao. I took a two hr nap today if that counts

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:35am EST
not really

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:35am EST
but i suppose you're still alive

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:35am EST
It doesn't if I get no sleep tonight which I probably won't. Weekends ftw

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 12:35am EST
More or less lol. Goodnight Nicholas

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 12:35am EST
g'night

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 7:58pm EST
Hey nick I have a question so when you return feel free to answer; What does this look like to you?

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
first stupid impression which means nothing

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
drooling mouth

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
once i actually looked at it then clicked on image creepy eye rolling in it socket oozing some bodily fluid

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
doesn't look like blood though

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
next though

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 8:10pm EST
some kind of empty darkness shown from behind a cutin half eyes

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 8:10pm EST
my writing is not doing too well, so many painful typos

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 8:15pm EST
btw you have no idea how proud of myself i am for answering within 1/2 an hour

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 8:24pm EST
I'm proud too I was expecting later

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 8:25pm EST
It's melting btw

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 8:25pm EST
But I think it'd be more effective in color

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 8:31pm EST
ahh I see, the melting makes sense, what is being left underneath the melting eyer?

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 8:43pm EST
What do you mean? All that black space is gonna be the inside of the eye socket. Which is why coloring would make that a little more obvious bc I can add in links and make it look more like an eye socket than whatever else.

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 8:44pm EST
And if that isn't what you meant please elaborate lol

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 8:45pm EST
So it will just be an empty eye socket

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 8:46pm EST
i didn't know if you just wanted like a hole into blackness of a literal eye socket or something behind the eye socket

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 8:46pm EST
blegh

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 8:46pm EST
eye socket--> melting eye

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
Oh I gotchu. Well I didnt really think that far into it yet. I just thought the idea of a melting eye was kinda cool

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
And just did a quick doodle of what it might look like

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 8:48pm EST
it is, and your quick doodle's need to stop putting me to shame

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 8:49pm EST
But I could put something in the eye socket. Subtly though yk. But that's dependent on the feeling I'm going for Which I also didn't attach to this yet. The first thing that comes to mind is like lifeless. Like it could work, but there'd also be more effective ways to portray that And should it be that then the eye socket would just be a black hole of nothing

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 8:49pm EST
& haha I'm sorry

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 8:50pm EST
Now all I can think of is awed hopelessness at the arbitrary nature of life

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 8:53pm EST
I was thinking about it and then like that saying how the eyes are windows into the soul or whatever came to mind. Like thinking of how I could tie it back to something basically soulless actually

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 8:57pm EST
and that showing the emptiness behind the windows of the soul show the true emptiness in the person themself?

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 8:58pm EST
Bam

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 8:58pm EST
Genius

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 8:59pm EST
You're good at getting to where I'm trying to go lmao

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 9:00pm EST
I'm writing intellectual spanish journals so my words are working better than usual today

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 9:02pm EST
Ohhh that's fun

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 9:03pm EST
except i can't speak spanish, but other than that it's only been taking ...6? yeah 6 hours to write almost nothing :)

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 9:03pm EST
I just realized I can write them in english then just rewrite in spanish with simpler phrasing and words

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 9:04pm EST
That's usually the easiest way to go

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
If I had realized this 5 hours ago I could have been playing minecraft by now

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 9:07pm EST
anyway, any other ideas of what will be on the despair/ hopelessness piece?

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 9:09pm EST
Well in making the eyes take up the majority of the paper, it's gonna be small like the lava lamp. Maybe smaller so there's not do much empty space cause I can only make the eyes so big

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 9:09pm EST
So in not entirely sure what else or how in gonna color the skin

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 9:10pm EST
/if im gonna have what's there of the face kinda fade into the background

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 9:10pm EST
I might do that actually

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 9:10pm EST
i feel like a hyper realistic one might work

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 9:10pm EST
except for that eye itself of course

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 9:11pm EST
Hm

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 10:00pm EST
You know the only problem with this is figuring out how to color it.

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 10:05pm EST
all i can think of is making it realistic, just having the melting eyes with nothingesss behind it be out of norm

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 10:05pm EST
normal skin tones and eye colors

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 10:06pm EST
or having a comic book style coloring with very solid colors

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 10:06pm EST
Well I was more referring to the actual eye. Like the white part. Course it'd have to have other colors in it. I'll have to add some grey and stuff I think. It's just odd

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 10:06pm EST
And the part that falls over the bottom of the eye especially

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
do you have some done so far?

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
so i can guess?

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
I colored the tear ducts pink ._. I can show you the drawing itself if you want

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
Which will get turned to a duller pink bc it's too bright

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 10:12pm EST
Here's one eye

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 10:12pm EST
Here's another

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 10:13pm EST
There isnt an actual face shape on the picture

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 10:15pm EST
What if I had the person all black too tho? Like had bright colors and like highlights where appropriate so certain things don't blend in. To kinda further the nothing. Dunno if that'd lose the message. Not that any normal person would be able to get the message through the picture alone even if it were colored completely normal

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
i don't think the person should be dark, then you would lose the contrast of darkness under eye

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
also if the eye is melting would the iris be all wobbly as well?

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 10:22pm EST
Yeah but I just needed like a placement idea. I didn't fix it yet

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 10:24pm EST
I guess the melted eye should be pretty opaque right? Cause im just thinking of it in terms of when it hits the tear ducts

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 10:25pm EST
the white part of eye should be opaque yeah

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 10:25pm EST
idk if that what you're asking though

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 10:26pm EST
What if I did the person in black and white though? Just plain old pencil and have the eyes in colored pencil? It's still gonna fade out on the sides. Like just so that it's like there's this cloud of a face yk what I mean? I don't want to draw an actual shape of a face Yeah it is

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 10:28pm EST
i like that idea

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 10:34pm EST
That'll make the dripping parts of the eye easier too like the outsides. Awesome. Off to work

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 10:34pm EST
have fun

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 11:26pm EST
Algjsofjalgbr

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 11:26pm EST
?

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 11:27pm EST
I'll show you

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 11:27pm EST
Waiting for it to send

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 11:28pm EST
Idt I should've colored it like this. But I could see it colored like this that's the thing. But idk how I'm gonna do the white parts

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 11:29pm EST
Laurie just suggested

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 11:29pm EST
That I have the irises melt off the bottom of the eye

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 11:31pm EST
No she said Woahhh. Just keep it with the melting irises. That is so cool I don't know what that means

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 11:31pm EST
But I can't just have thr irises melting off their face

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 11:32pm EST
do you have lines drawn for where the white is melting out of the eyes?

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 11:33pm EST
Yeah

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 11:34pm EST
Do you want me to send a closer picture? I realize you can't really see the pencil lines

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 11:35pm EST
here

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 11:36pm EST
http://i551.photobucket.com/albums/ii472/dravarian26/EYE.png

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 11:36pm EST
are you including the whit part and everything melting off as well?

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 11:37pm EST
is what I'm asking

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 11:37pm EST
or just the green because that is all i see

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 11:38pm EST
and black obviously

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 11:38pm EST
Yes. Right now I don't have any white underneath the iris but it's on the sides and stuff. That's why I asked if you wanted a closer up picture

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 11:39pm EST
okay i understand, well then don't you know like shading techniques and stuff to make it look shiny and wet?

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 11:39pm EST
If you amke the melted part look wet and liquidy

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 11:39pm EST
the white of the eye will stand out against the skin tones

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 11:39pm EST
which will be graphite

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 11:39pm EST
Should I do the white last then do you think

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 11:40pm EST
Shade in the face or whatever with pencil and do that afterward

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 11:41pm EST
It might be simpler that way

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 11:41pm EST
and won't drawing the white with a white coloured pencil do something to make it stand out? idk I'm not good at the how to draw parts

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 11:41pm EST
just the That's a cool idea part

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 11:43pm EST
Only a bit. You only see the white so much but against everything else it'll prob be fine

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 11:43pm EST
alright good

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 11:44pm EST
well I need to try and do homework, but my mind is not cooperating, that means i have to wake up early tomorrow to do it -.-

Steph Dudak January 5, 2012 at 11:44pm EST
The eye socket isn't workin much either womp. Oo good luck Nicholas

Nick Devlin January 5, 2012 at 11:45pm EST

Serendipity

Steph Dudak January 6, 2012 at 2:05pm EST
so i was late to school today -.-

Nick Devlin January 6, 2012 at 2:05pm EST
that's unlucky

Nick Devlin January 6, 2012 at 2:05pm EST
wake up late?

Steph Dudak January 6, 2012 at 2:06pm EST
yep. came in at 7:40. couldn't take my pre calc test and she wouldn't let me come in during my lab period to take it even though i told her i was doing absolutely NOTHING

Steph Dudak January 6, 2012 at 2:06pm EST
so i have to take it monday. either go in early to take it or take it during class but if i take it during class i'll miss the lesson sooo

Nick Devlin January 6, 2012 at 2:06pm EST
well it gives you more time to study and ask what's on the test

Steph Dudak January 6, 2012 at 2:12pm EST
yeah but i'm probably gonna get a make up test and those are usually more difficult. she gives us an outline before the test but yeah. on another note. did my critique today. some of the pieces didn't really fit together and i need to figure out what to actually do for this and how to make it so i'm not killing myself over it. like. calicch picked out the butterfly/hand one, the tear one, the lava lamp, and the confused~ one with the arrows saying like they kind of all fit together whereas the others kind of don't, but they're all good pieces individually. she said i should try to expand on those four that i did and tap into my ~own emotions and experiences and ~how i'd feel. cause those four show some sort of progression. and that instead of trying to put a concentration to a bunch of different pieces, try to focus on something and then go from there and then i'll possibly be less frustrated over it. so i kinda just need to lock in on something. when i initially tried to explain what i thought my concentration kinda was and she's like. "you can do better than that. you're smarter than that." i'm like dkgsklhjfh k. the good news is i have time though so i mean. i guess i need to sit down and think about it because my heads kind of all over the place </rant> sorry

Nick Devlin January 6, 2012 at 2:14pm EST
forgiven

Nick Devlin January 6, 2012 at 2:15pm EST
so based on those four what could a concentration be on?

Steph Dudak January 6, 2012 at 2:24pm EST
i think i have problems sticking to one thing you know. like i'll have ideas for things. and it seems like they go together but they really kinda don't. i don't really know though. i mean okay if you think about what's really going on in them. The lava lamp one i still don't really know how to describe. it's kinda really just my own contentness. the confusion one is kinda just what i picture when i think of confusion. it was funny cause calicch said when she looked at it. she described it as like. "the person knows something but they don't know if they should tell or not. like for example if your friends girlfriend is cheating on him, well do you tell him? you don't want em to think you're lying. and it's like these are wrapping around you making you unable to speak, you don't know what to do or where to go all confused and whatnot." so there's that. the tear one is self explanatory. then the arm and the butterfly showing a fragile person. i know i could like pull things from how i would feel personally. like think of my own experiences. and make the concentration relate to that kind of. a journey through my own head and emotions lol. calicch was like you are frustrated as hell with this. use that. aja HATED her concentration and she drew herself as this little ADD kid bothering her while she's trying to work on art. yadda yadda yadda. it's just an issue of thinking of something i can progress through and that's still interesting. and something that's like. that isn't going to make me frustrated after every piece and will allow things to kinda just come to me. like i said i gotta think about it really. something that'd make more sense but is specific and broad enough for me to work with

Nick Devlin January 6, 2012 at 4:34pm EST
i wish you good luck, tell me when you think of it, maybe i can help more then

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 12:00am EST

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 3:50pm EST

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 3:59pm EST

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 3:59pm EST
It's bad enough

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:00pm EST

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:01pm EST

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:01pm EST
and spanish was assigned this  I can make that excuse

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 4:02pm EST
Computer science stuff you should've started then lol

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:03pm EST
I was planning on doing the 2 smaller labs in class, which she told us to do

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:03pm EST
but

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:03pm EST
since she is not the brightest person with java we usually end up teaching her the lesson

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:03pm EST
which takes 10X longer

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:04pm EST
so there is no time in class

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:04pm EST
imagine if i hadn't gotten java by now o.o I'd have to handwrite this shit...

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 4:05pm EST
That'd be awful o.o

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:08pm EST
but anyway while i copy justin's source code

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:08pm EST
what is you doin?

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 4:10pm EST
Well I'm at my grams waiting to eat dinner. And I have to do physics and lit hw to do and I forgot I have to take my pre calc test tomorrow so I need to study for that -.-

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:10pm EST
ah yes i recall your annoyance at being late

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:10pm EST
find anyone to ask about the text?

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:10pm EST
test*

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 4:11pm EST
Nopppe. Actually I could ask Steph. But it doesn't matter I already basically know what's going to be on it.

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:11pm EST
do you know how to do what's on it?

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 4:12pm EST
For the most part

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 4:12pm EST
But to be honest

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 4:13pm EST
I can completely bomb this test and still be fine for the marking period

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 4:13pm EST
Im not too worried about it

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:15pm EST
lucky

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:15pm EST
you are very

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:15pm EST
or ya know hardworking or something

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:15pm EST
nah that's just silly

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 4:26pm EST
Hahaha

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 4:26pm EST
Math is just easy

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 4:26pm EST
Physics on the other hand

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 4:27pm EST
I have a test Tuesday and I don't even know how to do half the hw questions. I probably have like a c average in there

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:27pm EST
blegh annoying

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 4:27pm EST
And I need a good grade on this test

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 4:27pm EST
I also need to get going on my labs

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 4:27pm EST
That'll help my grade too

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 4:29pm EST
If I get an 85 on this test and a 93 on my lab notebook, I'll have a 79.5 and that's just through tests. Not including the couple hw assignments we've had and the extra credit I've done

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 4:29pm EST
Basically I'll just pull off a B this marking period hopefully

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:29pm EST
there's that math thing helping you out again

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 4:30pm EST
See the funny thing is. All physics is, is math. But I can't seem to apply it in there

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:30pm EST
most science math subjects annoy me like that

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:30pm EST
i can do theoretical math well

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:30pm EST
and theoretical science well

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:31pm EST
but when you mix the together for theoretical situations

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:31pm EST
i completely screw up

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 4:32pm EST
not fun

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:32pm EST
my definition of chem last year

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 4:33pm EST
lol chemistry. i don't even know how i did anything in there

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 4:33pm EST
i got an A on the final it was amazing

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:33pm EST
i wonder what i got

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:34pm EST
nevermind i don't need to

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:34pm EST
transcript is next to me

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:34pm EST
well overall i got a b

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:34pm EST
so no clue what that means

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 4:34pm EST
i like how many tests i did awful on. and mrs applegate was like. i know you can do better than this and i know you're trying so hard

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:45pm EST
yeah she's nice

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:45pm EST
idk why every complains about her

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 4:46pm EST
they complain cause she kinda can't teach. like a full class. she's a genius but she's not that good at actually bringing that out to everyone. one on one i think she's fine though. but i love mrs applegate. and i had her write a recommendation for me and RPI has a specific form. i went to her like 4 times going back bc i kept messing shit up and she was so cool about it and was like yeah i'll get this done and mail it out! (cause she's gotta mail it) i was like sklgsklh thank youuu

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:47pm EST
i can't think of a single class with more than 20 student where I thought the teacher could convey their abilities well

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:47pm EST
marotto came close though

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:48pm EST
she taught me things, which is kind of unusual for a teacher to do

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:48pm EST
usually its like the teacher introduces and concept which you stare at till you figure out

Nick Devlin January 8, 2012 at 4:49pm EST
she actually got people to figure out the concept from the things she said

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 4:49pm EST
dziedzic. seriously i feel like she makes things so easy and it makes so much sense when she does things on the board and everything. i can't talk for a full class but she's a great teacher

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 4:50pm EST
she originally majored in physics actually

Steph Dudak January 8, 2012 at 4:52pm EST
i like when i actually learn things from teachers. you're right that's actually not a very common occurance lol

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 4:31pm EST
NICK

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 4:31pm EST
STEPH

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 4:31pm EST

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 4:32pm EST
are you going to be busy in five minutes

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 4:32pm EST
nope, watcha needs?

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 4:32pm EST
fantastic

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 4:32pm EST

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 4:32pm EST

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 4:33pm EST

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 4:35pm EST

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 4:37pm EST

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 4:37pm EST
i mean

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 4:37pm EST
there's a black spot on it omg. it doesn't matter. but anyway what if i did a background like this or something http://i39.tinypic.com/wltzzn.png

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 4:37pm EST
well it'll be super big for you

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 4:37pm EST
That it is

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 4:37pm EST
1599x1142

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 4:37pm EST
and it looks amazing

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 4:38pm EST
you can finally use all the super specific line making we learn in graphic design

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 4:39pm EST
i kinda wanna leave it like that & edit it on the computer or something. have the hand be smooth and such yk? not look so much like colored pencil. that's a lot of editing to do. and i didn't realize how little amount of art pieces i really have on hand

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 4:44pm EST
I think this piece would be great on the comp

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 4:44pm EST
i should start getting back into this

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 4:44pm EST
you can add little details like reflectiveness

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 4:44pm EST
and you should

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 4:44pm EST
yk kinda sketching it out and filling it in on ps

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 4:44pm EST
so should i actually

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 4:49pm EST
yes you should

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 4:49pm EST
this will take some time

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 4:54pm EST
should i go back & try to do that sunburst with colored pencils do you think? so it's consistent?

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 4:54pm EST
like i can eventually go back in photoshop over the arm when i actually have hours to spend doing that

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 4:54pm EST
if you want to bacround it

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 4:54pm EST
yeah try to be consistant

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 4:55pm EST
unless you can completely do it online

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 4:55pm EST
right now i can't. i need to work on some more things just to stick in a portfolio for rpi

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 4:56pm EST
most of this stuff is gonna go in it, but i just gotta touch em up a tad, give em backgrounds and such. gotta go over the blue one with my blender lol

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 5:03pm EST
are you like fixing all of them for portfolio?

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 5:05pm EST
the ones i want in there yeah. like the tear one, some of it is just too light. the marker was running out when i was going over it i think. so it just needs to be blended a little more. so i'm gonna get that done, & draw up some other things. i might put one of my sharpie things in there, just to add another thing, show things i've done just using lines and patterns and stuff.

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 5:05pm EST
you have sharpie stuf?!

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 5:05pm EST
like what?

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 5:08pm EST
just those silly doodle-ish things i do. the one i put in my portfolio to get into ap art. i might try to do another and try to make it into something though yk

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 5:09pm EST
plus i do those on smaller paper. so it'll take less time once i have an idea going

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 5:10pm EST
i never saw those

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 5:11pm EST
you've seen the sharpie doodle that i put in my portfolio for ap art last year. i worked on it like the last few days of school basically lol

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 5:11pm EST

thats what im here for

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 5:35pm EST
i hate when people go and try to take credit off an image someone makes, so they have to go and stick the watermark across the entire image to prevent it. shame really

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 5:36pm EST
can't really blame them

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 5:36pm EST
but i understand

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 5:36pm EST
if you love soething that much email the creator

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 5:37pm EST
no i know. i'm just saying. when i go to look at something it obscures my view and it's distracting, but it can't be helped unless i go to buy the print lol. i understand why they do it and i'd do the same if i were in the position

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 5:47pm EST
architecture is like art

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 5:47pm EST
just more technical

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 5:47pm EST

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 11:11pm EST

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 11:23pm EST
That should be my art concentration rofl Thats so fun

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 11:23pm EST
i can think of many ideas

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 11:24pm EST
but more tumblr worthy than really college level

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 11:24pm EST
back to what it reminds me of

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 11:24pm EST
I thought of non suckish ideas for the art thing

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
Oh did you? Btw I tried to draw princess tiana. One half of her face looked good and then it went downhill lol

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
aww, disney characters are impossible for me to draw

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
they're like defined by their proportions

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 11:26pm EST
and i suck at proportions

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 11:26pm EST
I wish I had Laurie's talent of drawing fantastic Disney characters

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 11:26pm EST
she is really good

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 11:27pm EST
Tiana is one of my favorite princesses now, did you know that? Idk why. I think it's cause the green dress she wears in the forest wedding is really pretty. Black people look good in that color green

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 11:27pm EST
That was such a good movie

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 11:27pm EST
I was talking to linette during lit about how awesome tangled and princess and the frog are. Anyway

Aurora is my second favorite princess. No third. I'd totally name my kid aurora. Well maybe not. But I'd want to.

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 11:32pm EST

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 11:34pm EST

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 11:34pm EST
Maleficent

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 11:34pm EST
Idk whatever yk who I'm talking about

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 11:34pm EST
aurora would be a good middle name

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 11:34pm EST
It would be. Depending on the first name

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 11:34pm EST
Which would have to be really awesome too

Steph Dudak January 13, 2012 at 11:36pm EST
New goal in life~ have a kid, make her middle name aurora.

Nick Devlin January 13, 2012 at 11:36pm EST

right now i am paying fee to montclair

Steph Dudak January 14, 2012 at 5:41pm EST
good i hope mrs applegate mailed out that recommendation and my application fee for rpi went through. i don't like this whole applying to college thing

Nick Devlin January 14, 2012 at 5:43pm EST
i don't think anyone does

Nick Devlin January 14, 2012 at 5:43pm EST
its one of the worste processes I've ever gone through

Nick Devlin January 14, 2012 at 5:43pm EST
and you can go ask guidance which letters you have

Steph Dudak January 14, 2012 at 5:45pm EST
no

Steph Dudak January 14, 2012 at 5:45pm EST
mrs applegate had to do it herself

Nick Devlin January 14, 2012 at 5:45pm EST
ohhh

Nick Devlin January 14, 2012 at 5:45pm EST
why?

Steph Dudak January 14, 2012 at 5:47pm EST
my applications for RPI & NJIT, everything needs to be submitted online. transcripts and everything cause it's sendedu or whatever. but my recommendation for RPI, it was a specific paper that came with the application thing that i had to print out and give to mrs applegate, and she has to mail it or fax it to them. i couldn't use my recommendation from bach for NJIT either unless it was done online either? i didn't need a recommendation for NJIT tho. so i'm doing my next two applications on common app that way i can just get everything sent out and i don't have any issues or anything. it's a pain in the ass.

Nick Devlin January 14, 2012 at 5:50pm EST
very much so

Nick Devlin January 14, 2012 at 5:50pm EST
I've just paid $30 to send out SAT scores

Steph Dudak January 14, 2012 at 5:52pm EST

Nick Devlin January 14, 2012 at 5:54pm EST
maybe you entered it wrong?

Nick Devlin January 14, 2012 at 5:54pm EST
the first time?

Nick Devlin January 14, 2012 at 5:54pm EST
or there was a computing error

Nick Devlin January 14, 2012 at 5:55pm EST
call the school and fix it though

Nick Devlin January 14, 2012 at 5:55pm EST
or at least email someone

Steph Dudak January 14, 2012 at 5:57pm EST
it's right on the application though

Steph Dudak January 14, 2012 at 5:57pm EST
it's just the password for the status of the application

Nick Devlin January 14, 2012 at 6:01pm EST

Nick Devlin January 14, 2012 at 6:28pm EST
why don't you reflect it?

Nick Devlin January 14, 2012 at 6:28pm EST
then alter it slightly

Nick Devlin January 14, 2012 at 6:28pm EST
so its not weird

Steph Dudak January 14, 2012 at 6:31pm EST
i'm not finished yet.....

Steph Dudak January 14, 2012 at 6:31pm EST

Steph Dudak January 14, 2012 at 6:31pm EST

Nick Devlin January 14, 2012 at 6:36pm EST
so you're just making half the face?

Steph Dudak January 14, 2012 at 6:37pm EST
it's not half a face

Nick Devlin January 14, 2012 at 6:40pm EST
alright I don't understand so I will explain what I am saying again so you know what I am talking about

Nick Devlin January 14, 2012 at 6:40pm EST
you said the eybrow was off

Nick Devlin January 14, 2012 at 6:40pm EST
so i said reflect it for symettry

Nick Devlin January 14, 2012 at 6:40pm EST
then you said you would do that last

Nick Devlin January 14, 2012 at 6:40pm EST
which I didn't understand

Steph Dudak January 14, 2012 at 6:41pm EST
cause i don't feel like doing it right now

Steph Dudak January 14, 2012 at 6:41pm EST
i'm workin on the actual eyes. the eyebrows will take two minutes to fix up one and reflect it over

Steph Dudak January 14, 2012 at 6:41pm EST
so it's the last thing i'm worried about

Nick Devlin January 14, 2012 at 6:41pm EST
sense has been made

Steph Dudak January 14, 2012 at 6:41pm EST
i was just pointing out it was off bc it was something i noticed

Nick Devlin January 14, 2012 at 6:45pm EST
gotcha

Nick Devlin January 14, 2012 at 6:45pm EST

Steph Dudak January 14, 2012 at 6:52pm EST

Nick Devlin January 14, 2012 at 7:19pm EST
i heard your tone

Steph Dudak January 14, 2012 at 7:20pm EST
lolol

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 2:36pm EST
NICHOLAS. you did that colored pencil project right? with the 6 squares? do you remember what each square had to be? like the techniques used? i know graphite, just regular coloring, cross-hatch, stippling, color one way... but idk what the other one was. it's second to last on my spyro thing and i can't for the life of me think of what it is cause it just looks colored normally.

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 4:04pm EST
burnishing?

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 4:05pm EST
it was graphite, coloured pencil, stippling, crosshatching, burnishing, then random design of whatever style you pleased which meant make a random pattern

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 4:06pm EST
burnishing was when you smoothed out the colours you had with a light colour, usually yellow or white

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 4:06pm EST
it made it kind of waxy looking but the colours were much smoother

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 4:08pm EST
it was my favourite style we did

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 4:14pm EST
so i've heped you

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 4:14pm EST
Now I have a question

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 4:15pm EST
I decided one of my eyes is going to be an animal native to North America with a dream catcher for its eye

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 4:16pm EST
Bobcat, bald eagle, American bison, American alligator, eastern diamondback rattlesnake, elk, American black bear, woodchuck (also called groundhog), mountain beaver, American beaver, North American porcupine, Canadian lynx, coyote, kit fox, swift fox, common raccoon, black-footed ferret, fisher, American badger, striped skunk, North American river otter, mule deer, pronghorn.

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 4:16pm EST
I didn't exlude any even though there are some i know i won't do

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 4:16pm EST
Any of those stand out to you?

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 4:17pm EST
I'm doing this in coloured pencil obviously because i want it very detailed

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 4:17pm EST
i am imagining dark blues and purples for the overall colour

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 4:19pm EST
One sec

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 4:22pm EST
Coyote, American lynx, What's a pronghorn?

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 4:23pm EST
deer type thing

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 4:23pm EST
Picture?

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 4:24pm EST
Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 4:24pm EST
Coyote

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 4:24pm EST
Or

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 4:25pm EST
Bald eagle

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 4:27pm EST
my favourites were bison, bear. eagle, and badger

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 4:28pm EST
i liked ferret but they are too small to put a dreamcatcheras it's eye and zooming in on the face wouldn't leave enough detail to tell what it was

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 4:32pm EST
I'd def go with eagle then

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 4:34pm EST
yeah i think you're right, bear and badger both seem annoying

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 4:35pm EST
buffalo i think might work still and kind of want to try it

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 4:35pm EST
but eagles have really round eyes that would work well

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 4:37pm EST
You could try em both like on regular paper n see what you like better

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 4:37pm EST
i think i will be doing that

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 4:40pm EST
Always a good idea

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 4:43pm EST
was burnishing what you were asking about btw?

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 4:43pm EST
or was it some other style

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 4:45pm EST
I don't think so. I still don't know what it was though. I'll show you when I'm home cause I scanned it and took out the "cross hatching" one

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 4:45pm EST
It looks colored normally, just with different colors

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 4:47pm EST
no clue then, sorry. maybe he did something different that year?

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 4:48pm EST
I think he did. I just wish I remembered what x.x. Cause he didn't have us write what technique it was under it. He was like nah

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 4:49pm EST
just bring it in and ask him

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 6:34pm EST
is today an important game?

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 6:34pm EST
of course!

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 6:34pm EST
XD

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 6:34pm EST
why?

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 6:34pm EST
it's the playoffs

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 6:34pm EST
you lose, you're out

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 6:34pm EST
ahh

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 6:35pm EST
understanding has fallen upon me

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 6:35pm EST
still don't care

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 6:35pm EST
but at least i know

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 6:35pm EST
didn't think so but yeah it's good to know lol

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 6:35pm EST
you like thegiants right?

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 6:35pm EST
they winning?

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 6:36pm EST
yep yep!

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 6:36pm EST
last time i checked they were

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 6:36pm EST
funfun

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 6:36pm EST
i'm writing lab stuff

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 6:36pm EST
apparently i have some incorrect data, but i'm not sure why it's incorrect

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 6:36pm EST
i think it's human error why the bullseye wasn't placed on the floor right

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 6:36pm EST
retest the experiment at home

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 6:36pm EST
setup a lab

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 6:36pm EST
it was supposed to be 74 cm over, we were 69.75, so 4.25 cm off

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 6:36pm EST
but

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 6:36pm EST
our calculations were wrong

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 6:37pm EST
bc we didn't convert to cm & such from meters

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 6:37pm EST
but

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 6:37pm EST
even when you convert it you still get 69.75 for where the bullseye should be placed

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 6:37pm EST
doesn't making mistakes give you more to write about though?

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 6:38pm EST
yes it does

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 6:38pm EST
so it makes you look smarter and you get more credit

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 6:38pm EST
i suppose in the experimental section, i'm gonna just write it all how we did it before we realized we had messed up data

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 6:38pm EST
well only if it happens occasionally

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 6:38pm EST
then the conclusion & error analysis i get to talk about all that other garbage

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 6:39pm EST
i actually included diagrams in this lab too

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 6:39pm EST
AND I WAS DOING SO GOOD OMG READY

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 6:39pm EST
dammnn

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 6:39pm EST
THE FIRST PAGE IS SO NEAT

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 6:39pm EST
THEN AT THE BOTTOM, THE LAST LINE ON THE BACK OF THAT PAGE, THERE'S A GIANT LINE OF CROSS OUT

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 6:40pm EST
I don't know if there is anything more, but I can imagine you completely freaking out then despairing for days when you did it

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 6:40pm EST
just because of that one line

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 6:41pm EST
you have to see it

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 6:41pm EST
i hate when that happens

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 6:41pm EST
and it always happens

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 6:41pm EST
always

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 6:42pm EST
which is why i never write when i can help it

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 6:42pm EST
always type

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 6:42pm EST
which might explain why i have so many errors when i writ

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 6:42pm EST

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 7:31pm EST
http://i298.photobucket.com/albums/mm269/xsynysterstephx/NotFinished/Hayley1.png & http://i298.photobucket.com/albums/mm269/xsynysterstephx/editedpics/editedpicrupertgrint1.png are what they're from. well the second before it was badly edited

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 7:37pm EST
btw, how does this http://i298.photobucket.com/albums/mm269/xsynysterstephx/School/ESGrades.png equal a 92...? doesn't matter now obv but yeah

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:24pm EST
well its a .929 so more like a 93 but yeah

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
and those photoshop things are interesting

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
i highly dislike Ron's typography, mostly because it's illegible

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
i'm debating on using one of them

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
but the overall design is cool

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
it wasn't on a white background

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
when i did it

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
like

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
when i used it

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:26pm EST
the yellow makes more sense then

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:26pm EST
but i think the riot one kind of looks a bit better

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:27pm EST
it does, and i can take my website out of it

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:27pm EST
then move the circles closer

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:27pm EST
or take em out completely

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:27pm EST
to remove the negative space

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:27pm EST
i like the circles

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:27pm EST
http://i39.tinypic.com/2m82r82.png

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:27pm EST
the circles

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:27pm EST
were the navigation

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:28pm EST
when i used it as a layout

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:28pm EST
if you hovered over em

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:28pm EST
put them on it then!

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:28pm EST
on the left side

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:28pm EST
it adds like a frame

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:29pm EST
and is white the background for this one?

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:29pm EST
yeah this one the background actually was white

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:30pm EST
the circles look weird without the website name lol

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:31pm EST
they dont have a purpose without it

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:32pm EST
and would it be weird if i submitted this like this http://i42.tinypic.com/bi0wpl.png cause i don't have anything straight enough to do that with colored pencil

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:32pm EST
my moms like yeah why not it looks good

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:32pm EST
but you know mothers

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:32pm EST
yeah i know

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:33pm EST
can you add an effect to the light?

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:33pm EST
make it more colured pencil texted

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:33pm EST
textured*

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:34pm EST
i tried to do that and nothing looked right

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:35pm EST
but i feel like the backgrounds too smooth to go with the colored pencil

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:35pm EST
and i can't edit the colored pencil part to look like that really

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:35pm EST
no, hmm

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:35pm EST
can you make the white background lik...off-white?

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:35pm EST
that might help

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:36pm EST
idk, most of my computer art is guess and check

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:36pm EST
i can try

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:36pm EST
well

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:36pm EST
making the white won't really do much lol

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:36pm EST
making the white off-white

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:36pm EST
i bet i don't have the psd for this either

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:37pm EST
and my scanner decided it no longer wants to let me scan things onto my computer

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:37pm EST
psd?

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:37pm EST
it's a file for photoshop that allows you to save a file with all the layers still there instead of merging them all into one

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:37pm EST
the brain project & the one with the heart i had to take pictures of. and they don't look very good

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:39pm EST
hmm how'd you take the pictures?

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:40pm EST
with a camera. but i took em like an hour or so ago. and there's no place in my house with good enough lighting

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:40pm EST
like i had to take a picture of my painting, sword, and slimy one

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:40pm EST
but those were fine. i did those at like 2 in the afternoon

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:41pm EST
but those two i couldnt even edit them to save my life

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:41pm EST

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:41pm EST

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:43pm EST

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:44pm EST

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:45pm EST

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:45pm EST

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:50pm EST

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:51pm EST

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:53pm EST
real quick

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:53pm EST
should i include a description for all of these? it says it's optional but

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:55pm EST
yes

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:55pm EST
i feel like you should

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:55pm EST
otherwise they might misinterperate

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:55pm EST
okie

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:55pm EST
or not get it

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:56pm EST
should i use these symbols

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:57pm EST
Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:57pm EST
the square ones at the bottom?

Nick Devlin January 15, 2012 at 11:58pm EST
in my portfolio for graphic design?

Steph Dudak January 15, 2012 at 11:59pm EST
the bottom left, above the aqua one, is that like. part of that whole series you got goin down there

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:00am EST
yeah it is

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:00am EST
the only reason there is multiple rows is just so i could look at different colours

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:01am EST
I really liked that blue so i didn't even try colours for the first

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:01am EST
i like all the blue/purple/orange/yellow ones

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:02am EST
the brighter ones really

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:02am EST
yeah they are all supposed to be symbols for elements

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:02am EST
they're interesting though

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:02am EST
like in general i like them all

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:03am EST
but the colors of some throw me off a bit

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:03am EST
id use em tho

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:03am EST
any ideas for better colours?

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:05am EST
i just typed out this whole thing til i realized what you did

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:05am EST
um

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:06am EST
hold on

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:06am EST
the third column. those colors stand out to me cause i like them together. maybe if you did those all in like. what's the word for it.

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:06am EST
it starts with an a

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:07am EST
i think

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:07am EST
well with colors next to each other on the color wheel

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:07am EST
anachronistic ?

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:07am EST
and then you can have like shades of whatever colors

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:07am EST
analagous

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:08am EST
if you pick like 2 or 3 colors yk

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:08am EST
YES

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:08am EST
that's the word

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:08am EST
derp

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:08am EST
yeah I do like how those colours looks together

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:08am EST
but it's like

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:08am EST
each of them symbolizes like light water air sound

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:09am EST
how would i fit having multiples of the same symbol

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:11am EST
here

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:12am EST
umm

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:12am EST
http://i551.photobucket.com/albums/ii472/dravarian26/ElementalSymbols.jpg

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:13am EST
so colors that represent those more like would be more effective, no?

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:13am EST
mhmm

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:14am EST
the colours I have on that last picture with the captions explaining the elements

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:14am EST
Is not the colours I like best, just the first row

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:15am EST
, cause I'm lazy

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:15am EST
yeah i gotcha

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:15am EST
um

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:15am EST
what exactly is light fire

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:16am EST
it's kind of all those elements mixed in one

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:16am EST
fire and light were assumed to be the same thing

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:16am EST
along with heat

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:17am EST
I have an intensive encyclopedia of this elemental thing

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:17am EST
there's a religion to go along with ti

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:17am EST
and a country

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:17am EST
and a world

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:17am EST
and a solor system...

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:17am EST
I was a vry bored child

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:17am EST
water i'd do a lighter blue. like #1ac3ed ish why that tan/brown color for earth and green for wood?

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:17am EST
that's pretty cool

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:18am EST
yeah why those

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:18am EST
i'd associate green with earth and brown with wood

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:18am EST
well Earth I associated with dirt

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:18am EST
and green i assocaited with leaves

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:18am EST
like when you look at a forest

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:18am EST
its mostly green

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:18am EST
yeah but

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:18am EST
that's the leaves

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:19am EST
if you have a square thats supposed to be WOOD

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:19am EST
yaknow

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:19am EST
just sayin

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:19am EST
I get what you're saying

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:19am EST
#137c12 that green color tho, i like.

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:20am EST
#c3f2f0 - air

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:20am EST
idk how any of these look next to each other

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:20am EST
they look pretty nice alone though

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:20am EST
yeah the blue is a bit too light, but I do agree that my current blue is too dark

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:21am EST
and I just noticed the pattern when I zoom in on the wood

#ad6eca / #8753a0 - celestial space #3c98e6 / #3584fa / #00a5e2 - water?

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:22am EST
just other suggestions

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:22am EST
i'm just not fond of the color you used for celestial space

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:22am EST
nor am i

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:22am EST
Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:23am EST
but here is what the colour for wood looks like super zoomed in

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:25am EST
oh wow

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:25am EST
all the colours have that kind of pattern

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:25am EST
you can't see when it's all zoomed out though

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:27am EST
did you put a texture on the squares

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:27am EST
like all of them

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:27am EST
some of them i can tell it's obviously not just a plain color

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:28am EST
even the black i used for the symbols aren't just one colour

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:29am EST
the only solid colour i have is the border

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:29am EST
for each symbol

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:33am EST
I'm gonna fix all the colours you said to change

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:33am EST
and sharpen the quality

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:33am EST
okie. i wanna seee after. like i said i dunno how good the colors actually look, they just look nice in the preview in photoshop.

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:34am EST
should i include the text?

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:35am EST
i wouldn't

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:35am EST
you said you're putting it in your portfolio?

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:35am EST
so i assume there'll be a spot for explanation?

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:44am EST
i didn't see any

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:44am EST
just the title and the medium

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:45am EST
that's annoying

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:45am EST
then yeah i'd put the names in then

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:45am EST
meh, most of my stuff doesn't need explination

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:45am EST
if there's no description

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:45am EST
area

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:45am EST
yeah you're right

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:45am EST
yeah but it's good to have if you do need it yk. i mean i guess they don't really care but yk

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:50am EST
yeah I'll include it anyway

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:50am EST
I'll end up spend more time on the text somehow anyway

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:54am EST
sound

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:54am EST
what colour is sound

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 12:54am EST
Pale yellow

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 12:55am EST
I'll try

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:01am EST
this is really annoying

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:01am EST
everytime i zoom it turns a completely different colour

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:02am EST
Why are you zooming in on if

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:06am EST
if?

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:07am EST
it

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:08am EST
iPod , can't type

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:09am EST
oh I'm zooming in and out to fix details

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:10am EST
and each different level of zoom is different colours

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:10am EST
but i realize 100% zoom is probly the colour it will end up being

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:13am EST
what colour did you say for wood?

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:13am EST
brown?

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:14am EST
blegh I really want a green brown

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:14am EST
but that just looks like puke

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:14am EST
what kind of brown?

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:14am EST
sepia, dark, reddish

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:14am EST
A dark reddish brown. Only very slightly red

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:15am EST
I'd send a color code but I shut my computer down for a bit

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:18am EST
I found one

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:20am EST
and greenish for wood?

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:20am EST
I mean earth*

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:20am EST
earth is greenish?

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:21am EST
Yes. Try the green I sent earlier n see how that looks

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:21am EST
I associate earth with green bc I associate them both with the earth kingdom

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:23am EST
I think of pokemon

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:23am EST
in which ground type is brown

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:32am EST
ugh is this the stuff you spend all night doing

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:32am EST
I can't stop

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:32am EST
worse than minecraft

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:33am EST
Isn't it awful sometimes lol

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:33am EST
I'm like half done

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:33am EST
but I can't decide a colour for metal

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:33am EST
goldish? silverish?

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:33am EST
Silverfish

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:33am EST
Yes

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:33am EST
Silverfish

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:34am EST
Silver USB

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:34am EST
YOU KNOW WHAT

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:34am EST
I'm not longer correcting myself

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:34am EST
You can figure out what this blasted device tells you I say

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:37am EST
yeah

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:37am EST
cause I knew silverfish

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:37am EST
meant silver usb

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:37am EST
no

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:38am EST
it didn't

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:38am EST
because i just said silverish

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:38am EST
so that's what you meant

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:38am EST
fuck yeah

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:38am EST
haha

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:40am EST
anyway any ideas for animals or light? I keep think a reddish colour for animals, either that or just deleting them entirely, I don't even like it's design really

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:43am EST
orange/red orange etc

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:43am EST
light uh

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:48am EST
light should be red/orange?

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:48am EST
no animals if youre including that

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:48am EST
although that's not an element really

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:48am EST
light um

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:48am EST
idk

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:48am EST
idk!

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:50am EST
PRESSURE STEPH PRESSURE

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:50am EST
Element is the easier word I could use to describe

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:50am EST
actually there is a branched off religion that agrees with you

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:50am EST
the believe that animal and wood should be stricken from the list

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:51am EST
along with fire/light being split

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:51am EST
another group wants to add magnetism as an element but there is arguement that magnetism is a force not an element

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:52am EST
which bring light and fire into question along with sound since they too are forces

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:52am EST
its a bit convulted

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:52am EST
well then lol

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:52am EST
as long as you don't call them elements

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:52am EST
because that just ruins me

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:52am EST
but i really have no clue what you can use for light rainbow idk

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:52am EST
I did make a word in my language, i forget what it was called though

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:52am EST
white

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:53am EST
white light?

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:55am EST
sure

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:56am EST

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:58am EST

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 1:58am EST
and animal is getting deleted

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 1:59am EST
i like the orange in there though. like having the orange in the mix. you can't really put orange as light though. that's just silly. i dunno what else you can do for light

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 2:00am EST
ohh the order matters a bit ass well

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 2:00am EST
-.-

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 2:00am EST

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 2:26am EST

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 6:59pm EST
the extra s is for stupendous i'm guessing

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 6:59pm EST
but it was great

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 6:59pm EST
they're both great

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 6:59pm EST

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:00pm EST

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 7:00pm EST
very good idea

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 7:00pm EST
stealing works

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 7:00pm EST
as long as you don't get caught

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:00pm EST
steph this is the internet

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:00pm EST

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 7:00pm EST
nick

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 7:00pm EST
i didn't even think of it like that

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 7:00pm EST
hahaha

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 7:01pm EST
at first i seriously pictured you stealing it from somewhere or someone

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:02pm EST
...

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:02pm EST
yeah

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:02pm EST
I can see that

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:02pm EST
actually i can

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:02pm EST
i have little to no conscience

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 7:03pm EST
XD

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:03pm EST
i spelled conscience correctly on my first try

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:03pm EST
i feel accomplished

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 7:05pm EST
con science

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 7:05pm EST
that's how i think of it when i write it

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 7:05pm EST
and

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 7:05pm EST
wed nes day

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:05pm EST
b-e-a-u-tiful

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 7:06pm EST
exactly

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:06pm EST
and i realized the con-science thing just as i wrote it

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 7:06pm EST
i can't think of any others off the top of my head

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 7:06pm EST
there's definitely more tho

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:06pm EST
i thank bruce almighty for the beautiful one

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:07pm EST
i remember definitely

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:07pm EST
by thinking of the oatmeal comic

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:08pm EST
if you you spell definitely with an a then you are definAtely and Ass hole

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 7:09pm EST
hahahahaha YESS

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:10pm EST
but others besides them i con't really think of

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:10pm EST
you're right about having tons of them though

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:11pm EST
still can't tell between affect and effect though

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 7:11pm EST
i think

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 7:11pm EST
i get it sometimes?

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 7:11pm EST
like affect is a verb...

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
something affects you there are effects of something

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
i usually guess

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
if i don't know i go with effect since I see it a lot more

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
so there is more chance of it being right

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
this is true

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 7:17pm EST
so cause of that my little pony link you posted, i'm now watching other ~teens react videos. omg

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:17pm EST

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:18pm EST
raafi brothers are awesome

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:18pm EST

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:19pm EST
you should start watching them as well

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:19pm EST

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 7:19pm EST

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 7:20pm EST

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 7:20pm EST
i need to read that, i need to read kevin's book eian's like raaaawr you need to read hunger games !!!

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:20pm EST
hunger games can wait

Steph Dudak January 16, 2012 at 7:20pm EST
and i'm like skhfdhf I HAVE TO OTHER BOOKS TO READ STILL THEY TAKE PRIORITY OVER HUNGER GAMES

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:21pm EST
they can wait because that trilogy is boring compared to the series i gave you

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:21pm EST
well not really

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:22pm EST
hunger games is much more actiony

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:22pm EST
but action in books bores me

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:22pm EST
that's what movies are for

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:22pm EST
the plot is still good though

Nick Devlin January 16, 2012 at 7:22pm EST

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 9:19pm EST

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 9:19pm EST
not to mention it's no one elses business, and the fact that they're all making threats is juvenile and senseless.

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 9:19pm EST
that's unusual

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 9:19pm EST
high school kids acting juvenile?

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 9:19pm EST

Yes

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 9:27pm EST
waive your access

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 9:28pm EST
it's easier that way

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 9:29pm EST
some colleges require that you waive your right

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 9:29pm EST
idk

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 9:29pm EST

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 9:29pm EST

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 9:29pm EST
at all

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 9:29pm EST
and i should do this

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 9:29pm EST
You must enter one Counselor (who will complete the School Report and other forms for you) and at least one Teacher (who will complete the Teacher Evaluation for you.) You may enter an unlimited number of teachers and assign them to any colleges you'd like, but only one Counselor may be invited. Fields with a yellow dot are required and must be filled in prior to submission of this form. To ensure your information is saved, please click the Save button at the bottom of the page. After saving, those school officials with email addresses will receive an email inviting them to send your recommendations online or via mail, whichever they prefer. If any of your school officials choose to mail their forms, you will need to return to this website to print paper forms for them to mail.

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 9:29pm EST

I affirm that I will send an enrollment deposit (or equivalent) to only one institution; sending multiple deposits (or equivalent) may result in the withdrawal of my admission offers from all institutions. [Note: students may send an enrollment deposit (or equivalent) to a second institution where they have been admitted from the waitlist, provided that they inform the first institution that they will no longer be enrolling.]

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 10:10pm EST

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:28pm EST

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:29pm EST
i have this theory that if you let them have control of your money

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:29pm EST
then they are actually responsible for doing shit

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:29pm EST
are they are afraid of that

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 10:29pm EST
it was only one extra page to fill out btw.

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 10:29pm EST

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 10:37pm EST

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:38pm EST
you don't even need me here

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:38pm EST
you can just answer for me

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:38pm EST
then again

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
you would be talking to yourself

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
which is a tad odd

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
no i asked you a few days ago

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
like last week

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
when i was in the cafeteria in the morning

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
you had it with you

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
i know but you did just ask

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
then answer yourself

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
thus my silly joke

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
it's just like a reflex for me to ask if a book is good when someone tells me theyre reading something

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
ha

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:40pm EST
I have only been reading good books lately

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:40pm EST
its kinda nice

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:40pm EST
but i miss just reading all books

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:40pm EST
its been so long since i've read a meaningless fantasy novel

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:41pm EST
just dragons and magic and generic morals/ metaphors

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 10:43pm EST
at least you're reading something

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 10:43pm EST
i have to go read global warming papers and such so i dont fail my world affairs quiz

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 10:44pm EST

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
yheah that's a thing

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
i should be reading spanish subjugation sentence

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
you know what's worse than bombing a test?

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
no

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
bombing

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
stuff in general

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
like buildings

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
and stuff

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
although that is true

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
it is not not nearly as self-centered as i was looking for

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
unless i was in the building of course

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
at the beginning of the year with my first spanish test

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
i thought it was bombing a test for the first time

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
but i was wrong

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:47pm EST
today i though bombing every test and quiz you've taken in a class was the worst

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:47pm EST
still wrong

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:47pm EST
i have realized that continually having hope that you might to better this time

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:47pm EST
then being incorrect in that belief

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:47pm EST
that is the worst

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:47pm EST
that i have discovered so far

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:48pm EST
not only tha

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:48pm EST
but being unable to tell whether or not you are going to fail after you take it

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:48pm EST
I thought I would get a B

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:48pm EST
I failed

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
why don't you drop spanish?

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
if you're doing that badly. i mean do you even like it?

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
if i even just read all that right

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
oh you did

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
but

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
i just...

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
can't

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
as much as i despise taking tests

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
i still answer question in class correctly

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
i still help the other people

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
but it's like on the tests

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
i get stpid mistake after stupid mistake after stupid mistake

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:51pm EST
and i'm the last person t o turn in the test because i go over it like 5 times

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:51pm EST
so idk

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:51pm EST
blegh

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 10:51pm EST
don't treat your tests like a test then. look at your test like classwork or homework. or idk something you do decent on. i mean you know what you're doing, you just need to figure out a way to apply it to other things. tests in language classes are weird though i

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 10:51pm EST
ll give you that

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 10:52pm EST
everythings always easier said than done do you look over your stuff before you take the tests

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:53pm EST
yep

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:53pm EST
even been studying

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:53pm EST
as much as i know how

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:53pm EST
but its not like i get the homework right

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:53pm EST
they all have stupid errrors as well

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:54pm EST
it's just that i can find them and correct them as we're talking

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:54pm EST
I feel like a 3rd grader shoved up 5 grades

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:55pm EST
i want to move to mexico for a month

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:55pm EST
not speak english at all then come back

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:55pm EST
maybe i'll be able to pass then

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 10:56pm EST
Get Antonio to tutor you

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:56pm EST
haha

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:56pm EST
funny

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:56pm EST
he speaks street

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:56pm EST
he doesn't even realize how he talks

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:57pm EST
and is only doing better than me because of vocab and general knowledge of how things sound

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:57pm EST
like "that just sounds weird"

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:57pm EST
he doesn't know why

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:57pm EST
it just does

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:58pm EST
not helpful to stufy with

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 10:58pm EST
i know how to fix these problem i just want to complain

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 11:01pm EST
Well I'm good for that. I'd offer to help but once again, incapable

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 11:03pm EST
once again highly appreciated but not much to do about it, might as well complain about my lack of extra appendages in which to juggle.

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 11:03pm EST
just as useless

Steph Dudak January 17, 2012 at 11:08pm EST
This is true. Well, I must be off to study useless things aka global warming garbage, so I don't get another bad quiz grade in lees. I wish you the best of luck and I shall see you tomorrow. Goodnight!

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 11:08pm EST
good night

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 11:08pm EST
and have fun

Nick Devlin January 17, 2012 at 11:09pm EST

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:31pm EST

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:31pm EST
i thought you already wondered that

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:31pm EST
every other day of your life

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:32pm EST
that is true

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:32pm EST
but it is especially noticeable today

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:33pm EST
why

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:33pm EST
they gave us uniforms

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:35pm EST
i suppose youre unhappy with those lol

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:36pm EST
not really they're nothing compared to summer guard

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:36pm EST
i'll just miss wearing normal clothes

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:36pm EST
anyway

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:36pm EST

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:41pm EST

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:41pm EST

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:42pm EST

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:42pm EST
because of those things? or something else

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:42pm EST
what you just listed didn't sound bad

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:42pm EST
well my pre calc mid term this morning

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:42pm EST
6 questions, i didn't answer one of them

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:42pm EST
they're 8 point questions

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:42pm EST
ohh

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:43pm EST
yeah

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:43pm EST

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:43pm EST

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:43pm EST
and then

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:43pm EST
my world affairs quiz

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:43pm EST

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:43pm EST

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:43pm EST
highest i can get is a 75

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:43pm EST

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:43pm EST
i still gotta finish labs. and i gotta start art stuff. i have ideas in my head for general pieces

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:44pm EST
but not concentration pieces which is a problem

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:45pm EST
I hate scoring my papers before the teacher does

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:45pm EST
and just by blank answer i know the best possible if i get everything answered correct

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:45pm EST
is like a C

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:45pm EST
exactly

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:45pm EST

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
idk. i feel like even if i do bad onthat math thing though

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
which in reality is stupid bc it was open notebook

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
but you know, time. i can't manage it.

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
that's a tad worse

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
and you aren't the best with that

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
not that I can advise you

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
lol

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
I might be worse

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
but

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
see the only thing is i got a 66 on my last pre calc test

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:47pm EST
but i have a 99, 96, 82, and i think maybe one other grade

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:47pm EST
maybe

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:47pm EST
and 100 for the homework

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:47pm EST
i participate a lot

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:47pm EST
and i have extra credit from math league

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:47pm EST
even if i do kinda bad on this, i'll probably be able to just manage an A

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:47pm EST
you'll definitely get a B most likely get an A

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:48pm EST
i'm hoping cause taking that final would suuuck

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:48pm EST
oh shit

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:48pm EST
it would

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:48pm EST
last marking period i did worse and ended up with an A

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:48pm EST
you're probly fine

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:48pm EST
it's not like mr pecks where my grade is almost solely based on my tests -.-

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:49pm EST
btw, i have to include dimensions for all my pieces when i submit my portfolio. that is one of the most annoying things ever. just saying.

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:49pm EST
normally a good thing

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:49pm EST
anyway

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:50pm EST
that's sounds tortuous

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:50pm EST
have fun with that

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
I wonder if my other colleges need portfolios?

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
how would i send them?

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
shit

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
they'd tell you how i'm sure

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
like RPI is having me do it through slideroom

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:51pm EST

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:51pm EST

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:55pm EST
oh my god i had a dream when i was napping. like. it was some sort of holiday and you could hear like everyone around the world count down and say something like it was new years but it wasn't and it was day time. so then military aircraft started flying around towns and rode along house roofs and whatnot. and all around houses things were dropped. but the things that were dropped there were three different things. it was rings from sonic, but i don't remember the other two. one was some sort of electronic device. and the other thing i think was purple. but it was awesome. and it was really weird when i woke up cause it felt real even though it obviously wasn't and the house and neighborhood i was in in the dream wasn't my own

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:56pm EST
you do that

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:56pm EST
sorry i just saw http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly0nkrV4UV1qjkwxto1_500.png and thought of that

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:56pm EST
those kind of dreams are fun

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:56pm EST
where its just shit happening

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:56pm EST
no clue what or why

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 9:56pm EST

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:57pm EST

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:57pm EST

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 9:58pm EST

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 10:02pm EST

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 10:04pm EST

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 10:11pm EST

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 10:12pm EST

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 10:13pm EST
too much so

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 10:13pm EST
i like how the files *have* to be jpeg

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 10:14pm EST
i save everything as .png cause it always looked better that way.. i saw no requirement like that for my portfolio so i don't care

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 10:14pm EST
glad i downloaded a file converter then

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 10:14pm EST
otherwise I'd be annoyed

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 10:15pm EST
At least 5 Images drawn from observation

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 10:15pm EST
wanna see my portfolio guidelines? i was happy it wasn't as specific as syracuse or that

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 10:15pm EST

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 10:16pm EST
you can enter Music?

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 10:17pm EST
to apply for architecture

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 10:17pm EST
that's odd

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 10:17pm EST
the portfolio itself

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
doesn't even relate to architecture

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
drexel said that too

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
just wants creative garbage

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
they don't want grpahi deisgn stuff

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
too bad 99% of my things are done in colored pencil

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
actually

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
i think everything i uploaded

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
oh wait no

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 10:18pm EST

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 10:19pm EST
i might add in that lichtenstein painting i did last year

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 10:19pm EST
who'd you do?

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
uhh anthony green from circa survive? i don't even listen to them but at the time it was one of the best pictures i could find

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
i wish i did someone else

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
it was in the back of one of my AP magazine

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
s

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
that's exciting

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 10:21pm EST
I'm really glad i did john green

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 10:21pm EST
just wish the text was more exciting

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 10:21pm EST
the way it looks i mean

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 10:21pm EST
yeah but it works how it is

Steph Dudak January 18, 2012 at 10:21pm EST

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 10:23pm EST

Nick Devlin January 18, 2012 at 10:37pm EST
on repeat

Steph Dudak January 20, 2012 at 2:25pm EST
do you think i can include stuff i did in computer graphics in my portfolio? Maybe not the floor plans but the screw driver and deck gun anyway?

Nick Devlin January 20, 2012 at 2:55pm EST
I did

Nick Devlin January 20, 2012 at 2:56pm EST
i don't see why you woulnt be able to

Steph Dudak January 20, 2012 at 2:57pm EST
i feel like it'd be a good idea. http://i39.tinypic.com/2q0qemf.png ^ nearly perfect picture, no editing. unfortunately i wasn't so lucky with the heart but that's okay lol. yeah i don't see why either. i'm gonna. i wish i actually printed out small versions of those though

Steph Dudak January 20, 2012 at 2:59pm EST
actually i do have one of the deck gun

Steph Dudak January 20, 2012 at 2:59pm EST
sdjghfl and i have all of those um. shape things!

Steph Dudak January 20, 2012 at 3:00pm EST
and the nuts and bolts and my original title blocks haha win

Steph Dudak January 20, 2012 at 3:07pm EST
theyre all kinda useless though unless i can scan them which i can't so

Nick Devlin January 20, 2012 at 11:05pm EST
You can scan them piece by piece?

Nick Devlin January 20, 2012 at 11:05pm EST
meh idk

Nick Devlin January 20, 2012 at 11:05pm EST
I like the brain pic

Nick Devlin January 20, 2012 at 11:05pm EST
came out really clear

Steph Dudak January 20, 2012 at 11:05pm EST
i already submitted it

Steph Dudak January 20, 2012 at 11:06pm EST
i took pictures and you can see the dimensions and stuff

Nick Devlin January 20, 2012 at 11:06pm EST
ah that might prevent that

Steph Dudak January 20, 2012 at 11:06pm EST
i put em in the middle though since they weren't the best things

Steph Dudak January 20, 2012 at 11:06pm EST
i just wanted to include them to show other stuff

Steph Dudak January 20, 2012 at 11:06pm EST
i put in the deck gun, screw driver, and truncated pyramid

Nick Devlin January 20, 2012 at 11:07pm EST
we're about to start those

Nick Devlin January 20, 2012 at 11:07pm EST
so excited

Steph Dudak January 20, 2012 at 11:07pm EST
:D

Steph Dudak January 20, 2012 at 11:07pm EST
i'm excited for you

Steph Dudak January 20, 2012 at 11:07pm EST
those were some of the most fun yet extremely frustrating projects ever

Steph Dudak January 20, 2012 at 11:07pm EST
wait til you have to cut out the tabs for the truncated cylinder o m g

Nick Devlin January 20, 2012 at 11:08pm EST
0.0

Nick Devlin January 20, 2012 at 11:08pm EST
I remember looking at yours

Steph Dudak January 20, 2012 at 11:08pm EST
OH the truncated cone that one

Steph Dudak January 20, 2012 at 11:08pm EST
not even the cylinder

Steph Dudak January 20, 2012 at 11:09pm EST
the truncated cylinder is bad. but the circles are bigger on the truncated cone

Steph Dudak January 20, 2012 at 11:09pm EST
and the bottom and top aren't attached to the middle in anyway

Steph Dudak January 20, 2012 at 11:09pm EST
which makes putting it together annoying

Nick Devlin January 20, 2012 at 11:10pm EST
fun -.-

Steph Dudak January 20, 2012 at 11:10pm EST
the little figures are worth it in the end lol

Steph Dudak January 20, 2012 at 11:10pm EST
i dont have them anymore

Steph Dudak January 20, 2012 at 11:11pm EST
it'd be awesome if i did though

Steph Dudak January 20, 2012 at 11:11pm EST
could've included those with the layout in my portfolio

Nick Devlin January 20, 2012 at 11:11pm EST
I wonder what kind of box I will bring in first?

Nick Devlin January 20, 2012 at 11:11pm EST
It'll be complicated as hell

Nick Devlin January 20, 2012 at 11:11pm EST
just cause I can

Nick Devlin January 20, 2012 at 11:11pm EST
and I am allowed like 4 weeks per project

Nick Devlin January 20, 2012 at 11:11pm EST
since my class is stupid

Nick Devlin January 20, 2012 at 11:11pm EST
but that is a thought for some other day

Nick Devlin January 20, 2012 at 11:12pm EST
since I have a competition tomrrow

Nick Devlin January 20, 2012 at 11:12pm EST

Nick Devlin January 22, 2012 at 4:54pm EST
"There should be a minimum of (5) fi ve samples of drawings made from direct observation"

Nick Devlin January 22, 2012 at 4:54pm EST

Steph Dudak January 22, 2012 at 4:56pm EST
when you sent me that portfolio requirements page i pointed that out

Nick Devlin January 22, 2012 at 4:56pm EST
i didn't realize it was this school

Steph Dudak January 22, 2012 at 4:56pm EST

Nick Devlin January 22, 2012 at 4:56pm EST

Steph Dudak January 22, 2012 at 4:56pm EST

Nick Devlin January 22, 2012 at 4:59pm EST
fuck

Nick Devlin January 22, 2012 at 4:59pm EST
this isn't gonna go well

Nick Devlin January 22, 2012 at 4:59pm EST

Steph Dudak January 22, 2012 at 4:59pm EST

Nick Devlin January 22, 2012 at 4:59pm EST

Nick Devlin January 22, 2012 at 5:01pm EST

Steph Dudak January 22, 2012 at 5:01pm EST

You need to stop slacking

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
pfft slacking

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
it's not like this was all assigned over a month ago

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
I'm doing physics hw and getting questions right and it's amazing

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:18pm EST

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
All by myself

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:18pm EST

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:29pm EST
L and R bother me

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:29pm EST
the rest i can accept

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:29pm EST
Yeah those are annoying J bothers me a little bit but it's not unbearable

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:30pm EST
Idk why it does

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:30pm EST
Just when it comes off the bottom yk

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:30pm EST
it's mostly because of how squarish it looks compared to the rest

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:31pm EST
I think I'm changing it

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:31pm EST
then i will copy paste some teeth on the circles

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:31pm EST

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:31pm EST
I finished my tire so I have the rest of the week to do what i want

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:32pm EST
Sounds like a plan Haha I still have to put in like the entire electrical circuit in my floor plan. I've done like nothing since it was assigned

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:33pm EST
you guys plan out wiring?

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:33pm EST
that sounds interesting

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:33pm EST
Which was... Tuesday? I have the master bedroom lights in. GFI outlets in the two bathrooms and a heat/light/fan switch thing in both

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:33pm EST
That's all I have done

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:33pm EST
I gotta put the circuit breaker in the garage. The smoke detectors. And the rest of the lights and outlets

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:34pm EST
Master bedroom still needs outlets

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:34pm EST
what about the heated floor and the air tube system that goes throughout the house and to various external ports?

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:34pm EST
plus all the dark matter storage container areas

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:34pm EST
you'll need a lot of outlets in there

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:34pm EST
Shut up its just lights and outlets for normal things

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:35pm EST
those aren't normal?

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:35pm EST
my mom said everyone had that stuff!!

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:35pm EST
-.-

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:38pm EST
So I'm gonna die when I have to take this pre calc test Wednesday

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
this is an odd flip flop

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
understanding physics and fear of pre calc test

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
I know o.o and the worst part about it is

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:40pm EST
My physics test goes on third marking period. The pre calc test I think goes on the second. I'll have to ask her

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:40pm EST
That'd suck

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:40pm EST
But it probably does

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:41pm EST
Omg third marking period. The years like halfway over now

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:41pm EST
more like 2/3

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:41pm EST
we don't do shit 4th quarter i don't think

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:42pm EST
well not in my classes anyway

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:42pm EST
Not really. I mean once like may hits no ones gonna give a shit cause they were already accepted into colleges and whatnot

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:43pm EST
I'll be done with actual lit in may, having taken my exam. After some day in may I have my ap art stuff to bring in for that "exam" and I get to work on my square

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:43pm EST
any ideas?

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
I haven't really thought about it yet. That's another thing I gotta think about but I'll probably wait to brainstorm about that on a later date

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
Bc idk what my concentration is yet /:

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
good ide

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
She really is no help

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
meh

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
"you can do better"

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
at least you're not teaching her how to draw

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
"these four show some kind of progression and a direction" Yet Those four had the same base ideas as the other ones

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
True

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
But still

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
yeah I got what you mean

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
I think she just like the more abstract designs the best

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
She does

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
She told me. She likes all the pieces I have individually. But she likes the ones that are actually designed based best just bc that's the art style she likes

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:47pm EST
Meanwhile while we were critiquing my stuff Jess liked all the more realistic looking things bc that's her art style Irrelevant

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:47pm EST
I just can't seem to lock in on an idea

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:48pm EST
because locking in

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:48pm EST
isn't really a concept associated with art

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
Not necessarily. A concentration is actually a common thing

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
Like

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
a 30 day challenge

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
Have you ever really scrolled through deviantart? I'm watching this one girl who takes these awesome self portraits with fruits

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
yeah

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
I've seen people do those

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
I suppose comics are concentrated art

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
and disney

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
and most things

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
but still

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
Not Necessarily either lol

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
its hard

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
idk I am not good at describing things well when distracted

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:51pm EST
It's just following a certain theme and exploring it. Like Ben Heine I think it's spelled. He does mixed media photography where he has a piece of paper with a drawing in place of an object I'm sure you've seen some of it It's fantastic

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:52pm EST
that's cool

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:52pm EST
Idk. The point is I'm creative til the point where I need to follow a certain thing

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:52pm EST
Even where I was going with these like it seemed to make sense but idk. I CAN DO BETTER apparently. Whatever that means.

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:53pm EST
it's almost like you can't make the pieces you are trying to make because you are all rushed

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:54pm EST
I have random ideas for things. Some of which haven't been working out. But nothing follows a certain thing. My heads too over the place for that

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:56pm EST
i can sympathize

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:56pm EST
it's hard to write in spanish while looking for juggling logo to make stencil out of

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:56pm EST
and dread doing my labs

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:56pm EST
which will take till tomorrow

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:57pm EST
i get to sympathize with your lack of sleep now too!

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 10:57pm EST
so excited

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 10:59pm EST
Oh goodness. Worst thing ever

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 11:00pm EST
I slept for like 13 hours on saturday

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 11:00pm EST
Went to bed at about 2am, woke up at 3 in the afternoon

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:02pm EST
not the best

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:02pm EST
to have that sleep schedule

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:02pm EST
but at least its a sleep schedule

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:02pm EST
as opposed to

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:02pm EST
ya know

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:02pm EST
a sleepless one

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 11:03pm EST
Well it makes up for my lack of sleep during the week

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:07pm EST
that's what weekends are for!

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:07pm EST
well except

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:07pm EST
that I have to be up by 8 on saturday and sunday

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:07pm EST
and go to colorguard and church things

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 11:07pm EST
I'd kill myself

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:08pm EST
yeah

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 11:08pm EST
Lawl church

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:08pm EST
you're jealous of my church

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:08pm EST
don't lie

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:08pm EST
my pastor is an freakin artist

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:08pm EST

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:09pm EST

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 11:10pm EST
Is that actually her or did you just send me a picture of some lady hugging black children

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:10pm EST

Hahahaha crack addict

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:17pm EST
you know it

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 11:17pm EST
I'm looking for ideas so that's why I'm not answering

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:17pm EST
sounds like a fun time

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:17pm EST
I should be looking for ideas on my final eyes picture

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:18pm EST
since ya know its due on friday

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:18pm EST
but meh

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:18pm EST
i'm busy

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 11:20pm EST
Speaking of crack addicts

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 11:21pm EST
And you being a slacker

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 11:21pm EST
- Mental disorders personified through the physical appearance of a person or in their environment. someone who is bipolar might be wearing a mask. A schizo may see mouths on furniture as if that may be the source of the voices they hear -the affects of drugs personified through the environment and physical appearance of a person Interesting ideas. Not that imma use em I'm just saying

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:22pm EST
they are

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:22pm EST
i wonder how paranoia would be personified

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:22pm EST
or autism

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:23pm EST
dyslexia

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:23pm EST
that one might be fun

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:23pm EST
use tyopgraphy

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 11:23pm EST
That would be cool

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:24pm EST
and you could use design and abstract-ness

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:24pm EST
since the letters and words would be all fucked up

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:24pm EST
give it weird colours

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 11:24pm EST
If I had time I'd try to do something along those lines Technically I could and use all my other stuff as breadth pieces rofl. Noooo. You know what I like

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
yeah that idea totally works

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
do it

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
i won't stop you

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 11:26pm EST
Psychedelic art is cool

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:26pm EST

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 11:26pm EST
http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_art I have a lot in my art tag too

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 11:28pm EST

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 11:28pm EST
Like

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 11:28pm EST
Graffiti is illegal

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 11:28pm EST
Psychedelic art often involves drugs

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 11:29pm EST
Other morbid things I mean. I don't think ripping organs out or kind of wanting to draw from real organs is really a totally good/normal thing I think it's something in my brain

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 11:30pm EST
Cause I'm a really good kid. It's like an alter ego except not at all

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:31pm EST
i want to let you keep rambling to see where you go

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:31pm EST
but i get it

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 11:32pm EST
If I wasn't simultaneously doing math homework

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 11:32pm EST
That probably would've turned into an idea

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:33pm EST
alter ego

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:33pm EST
kinda like split personaly i suppose

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:33pm EST
or bipolar

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:33pm EST
or schizophrenic

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 11:33pm EST
Schizophrenic

Steph Dudak January 23, 2012 at 11:34pm EST
Yeah

Nick Devlin January 23, 2012 at 11:39pm EST

Steph Dudak January 24, 2012 at 12:13am EST
What if I make my concentration be something like "what lies beneath" or something like that. So it's not necessarily emotion or anything. Just different ways to show people's inner beings or something like that being brought into the light Out to the surface

Nick Devlin January 24, 2012 at 12:15am EST

Nick Devlin January 24, 2012 at 12:15am EST

Steph Dudak January 26, 2012 at 7:10pm EST
which one of the comedies

Steph Dudak January 26, 2012 at 7:10pm EST
seems most interesting

Steph Dudak January 26, 2012 at 7:10pm EST
i need to pick like a um two like passage things that characterize two characters. she's like preferably one after the other or something weird like that blahblahblah

Steph Dudak January 26, 2012 at 7:11pm EST
i tried to read the tempest or whatever that didn't seem to work out very welll

Nick Devlin January 26, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
As you like it

Nick Devlin January 26, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
people say that's one of his best

Nick Devlin January 26, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
and has his most well developed female charcter out of any of his plays

Steph Dudak January 26, 2012 at 7:24pm EST
PROTEUS He after honour hunts, I after love: He leaves his friends to dignify them more, I leave myself, my friends and all, for love. Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me, Made me neglect my studies, lose my time, War with good counsel, set the world at nought; Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.

Steph Dudak January 26, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
this isn't in the one you were talking about

Nick Devlin January 26, 2012 at 7:26pm EST
no it is not

Steph Dudak January 26, 2012 at 7:27pm EST
direct characterization~

Nick Devlin January 26, 2012 at 7:27pm EST
very direct

Steph Dudak January 26, 2012 at 7:28pm EST
the other guy valentine leaves right before that though

Steph Dudak January 26, 2012 at 7:28pm EST
i don't think they really need to be in like. i cant think of the word but right after each other but i feel like she'd rather it like that

Nick Devlin January 26, 2012 at 7:29pm EST
"i don't think they really need to be in like. i cant think of the word but right after each other but i feel like she'd rather it like that"

Nick Devlin January 26, 2012 at 7:29pm EST
Was I meant to understand that sentence you just wrote?

Steph Dudak January 26, 2012 at 7:33pm EST
uhhhhh

Steph Dudak January 26, 2012 at 7:33pm EST
no normal person would've understood that i don't think

Nick Devlin January 26, 2012 at 7:34pm EST
so obviously you expect me to

Steph Dudak January 26, 2012 at 7:34pm EST
theee passages. of two characters. being characterized. i don't think they have to be one right after each other. for example: Person 1: hey i'm characterizing myself and stuff Person 2: hey i'm also characterizing myself and i'm characterizing person 1. i don't like him. as opposed to two randomly picked passages. but i feel like she'd want them to be one right after the other

Nick Devlin January 26, 2012 at 7:35pm EST
ah

Nick Devlin January 26, 2012 at 7:35pm EST
you want the characterizations to be realted

Nick Devlin January 26, 2012 at 7:35pm EST
and preferably foiling weachother

Steph Dudak January 26, 2012 at 7:36pm EST
i suppose

Steph Dudak January 26, 2012 at 7:36pm EST

Steph Dudak January 26, 2012 at 8:02pm EST

Nick Devlin January 26, 2012 at 8:02pm EST
not sure

Steph Dudak January 26, 2012 at 8:02pm EST

Steph Dudak January 26, 2012 at 8:02pm EST
too bad you need 4 years

Nick Devlin January 26, 2012 at 8:03pm EST
but i'm glad she did

Nick Devlin January 26, 2012 at 8:03pm EST

Nick Devlin January 26, 2012 at 8:03pm EST

Nick Devlin January 26, 2012 at 8:03pm EST

Steph Dudak January 26, 2012 at 8:04pm EST

Steph Dudak January 26, 2012 at 8:04pm EST
along with i had no actual books for that class lol

Nick Devlin January 26, 2012 at 8:04pm EST
reasons why i should have taken it

Steph Dudak January 26, 2012 at 8:04pm EST
and he's so laid back and stuff it was one of the easiest classes of my day

Steph Dudak January 26, 2012 at 8:04pm EST

Steph Dudak January 26, 2012 at 8:04pm EST
to be completely honest

Nick Devlin January 26, 2012 at 8:05pm EST

Nick Devlin January 26, 2012 at 8:05pm EST

Nick Devlin January 26, 2012 at 8:07pm EST

Nick Devlin January 26, 2012 at 8:07pm EST

Nick Devlin January 26, 2012 at 8:10pm EST

Nick Devlin January 26, 2012 at 8:10pm EST

Steph Dudak January 26, 2012 at 8:29pm EST
my dog will try to sit on you if you're like on the couch or something sometimes. but she's kind of a pitbull/german shepherd so she's not exactly a tiny dog that is suitable to sit in a persons lap

Nick Devlin January 26, 2012 at 8:29pm EST
yeha i can imagine

Nick Devlin January 26, 2012 at 8:29pm EST

Well a woman who'll kiss on the very first date Is usually a hussy. And a woman who'll kiss on the second time out Is anything but fussy. But a woman who waits 'til the third time around, Head in the clouds, feet on the ground! She's the girl he's glad he's found--she's his Shi-Poo-Pi! Shi-Poo-Pi! Shi-Poo-Pi! Shi-Poo-Pi!

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 2:56pm EST
To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. -- Ralph Waldo Emerson. Growing up, we are heavily influenced by the people around us. One main idea we are given is that we cannot live happy, successful lives unless we get a job that will make us a lot of money. While money is an important factor in life, it is also important that you spend your life doing something you actually enjoy doing. It is important to follow your own path and see where it takes you. You only have one life to live; do what makes you happy. This is something I have considered in deciding my major in college. I have always taken an interest in art and math which, in addition to my already developed interest in computer graphics, influenced me to take Introduction to Computer Graphics when I began high school. As a result of my enjoyment in this class, I took Advanced Computer Graphics junior year, along with regular art classes my sophomore, junior, and senior year, and am currently enrolled in an Architectural Design class. At the end of my Advanced Computer Graphics class, we started drawing floor plans in DataCad. It was at this point that I realized I wanted to major in architecture because of how much fun I had creating the floor plans and elevation views. This year I am expanding on that knowledge and began this year drawing floor plans by hand. While it takes a while to do, the final product is worth it. I have also moved on from drawing by hand to using CadKey to draw floor plans and I have learned how to add electrical circuits into the plans. Throughout high school, I have reconsidered multiple times my major choice for college but I am now sure of what I want to do. What I have also realized is I might have always known this. Ever since I was young, I have loved looking at houses and buildings while thinking of ideas for a future home that I would design myself. Living in a house that I designed has always been a dream of mine and I plan to do what it takes to make this dream come true. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, the greatest accomplishment one can achieve in this world is to be themselves. I hope to do this by pursuing an architecture major and becoming the person I see myself being. You've already read this like 786 times, but could this count as a "topic of my choice"

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 2:56pm EST
practice is good

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 2:57pm EST
something you actually enjoy doing.-->you love doing? idk sounds nicer

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 2:57pm EST

If you have not already done so, you must complete the 2012-2013 CSS (College Scholarship Service) PROFILE application for us to fully evaluate your eligibility for our Rensselaer grants and campus-based aid programs. In addition, all federal aid programs require the completion of the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid). Both the PROFILE application and FAFSA can be done immediately. Our priority filing deadline for these applications in order to ensure that you receive your financial aid, should you be accepted at Rensselaer, is 2/1/2012. Here are the websites for you to visit for more information: CSS PROFILE: https://profileonline.collegeboard.com. (Our school code is 2757) FAFSA: www.fafsa.gov (Our school code is 002803) There is no charge to file the FAFSA. Depending on family income and assets, CSS Profile may allow you file the application without paying a fee.

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 9:54pm EST
Divided into three vertical rectangles so the white space on the aides and stuff would be like a black border

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 9:56pm EST
I was thinking of having the first square, right of the face, some smiley thing. Only shows the eye and part of the mouth But on of those really fake smiles Then the middle I wanted to be like the skin peeling or something idk ripping melting suggestion to make it not lame And then the third which is the left side of the face To show the inside of the person How they really are Bringing that up front But idk what to do

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 9:56pm EST
I didn't really think about it

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 9:57pm EST
I still wanna do the thing I tried to do a million years. Ago with the eyes melting out of the persons sockets

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 9:57pm EST

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 9:59pm EST

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 10:00pm EST
blacks and reds

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 10:01pm EST
Yeah. See the thing is if I did a design for that I'd have to do some sort of design for the first one too don't youu think?

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 10:01pm EST
a more peaceful one

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 10:01pm EST
to contrast

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 10:04pm EST

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
Maybe half an inch diameter

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 10:07pm EST

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 10:07pm EST

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 10:07pm EST

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 10:08pm EST
More than half actually

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 10:08pm EST
Like 3/4

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 10:08pm EST
still tiny

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 10:08pm EST
Just estimating something simple

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 10:08pm EST
but a bit more acceptable

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 10:08pm EST
a lightbulb?

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 10:08pm EST

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
Falling out of someone's head

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 10:09pm EST

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
Losing ideas Basically me in a nutshell

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
how many *insert stereotype here* does it take to screw in a lightbulb

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
first thing i thought of

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
Why does it take more than one squirrel to screw in a lightbulb

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
Because

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
They're so darn stupid

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
spongebob?

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
Yessir

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
i member

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
But um yeah then the background will be all swirly and stuff can come out of the lightbulbs that fell to the ground

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
DAMN IT MORE BROKEN GLASS

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
sorry

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 10:11pm EST

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
falling out of the head

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
Lol old time ideas

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
that way they're easier to draw

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
Before lightbulbs ideas were represented by candles

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 10:13pm EST
exactly

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 10:13pm EST
Interesting

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 10:17pm EST

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 10:17pm EST
gives you new textures as well

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 10:17pm EST

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 10:17pm EST
i like fire

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
If the candles set things on fire

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
Like papers and shit and the smoke released pretty little things

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 10:19pm EST
How the fuck am I gonna do this Theres another one that can be looking inside someone Someones brain overflowing with ideas With no way to get out. All chained up and stuff

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 10:19pm EST

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 10:24pm EST
TOTALLY

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 10:24pm EST
If you sculpt something like that. Well like make the base of the lightbulb a candle holder And then the bulb part twists on

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 10:24pm EST
That'd be fun

Steph Dudak January 30, 2012 at 10:24pm EST

Nick Devlin January 30, 2012 at 10:25pm EST

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 3:04pm EST
pfft an idea that makes sense?

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 3:04pm EST
no my plan

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 3:04pm EST
was to grow a new tree

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 3:05pm EST
so that it would look just right for me to draw

Steph Dudak January 31, 2012 at 3:07pm EST
even better idea

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 3:07pm EST
i thought so

Steph Dudak January 31, 2012 at 3:11pm EST

Steph Dudak January 31, 2012 at 3:12pm EST

this debate is getting a bit serious

Steph Dudak January 31, 2012 at 3:29pm EST
good

Steph Dudak January 31, 2012 at 3:30pm EST
keep goin til you get the last word~

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 3:31pm EST
oh i am

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 3:31pm EST
here's his ananolgy

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 3:31pm EST
for example, if one was sick and only one medication could cure them of the specific disease, they would insist on using only that one medication if it was available, and nothing else. God always exists and thus His mercy is always available for those who choose to believe in Him properly and rely on Him, so it does not make sense to, when the One True God can be relied upon, to turn to a creation and falsely label it

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 3:32pm EST
when would there ever be only one medication?

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 3:32pm EST
differnt doctors prescribe different things

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 3:32pm EST
let alone people who aren't doctors

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 3:32pm EST
which i will point out

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 3:32pm EST
except more eloquently

Steph Dudak January 31, 2012 at 3:34pm EST
oh gosh

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 3:46pm EST
ugh this is going on forever

Steph Dudak January 31, 2012 at 3:46pm EST
that's what happen when you debate religion lol

When someone uses their sound mind, they reach the conclusions that God must exist, and that He does not resemble the creations in any way. These are facts, not matters of opinion.

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 3:47pm EST
I hate when people use the word fact

Steph Dudak January 31, 2012 at 4:05pm EST
That guy

Steph Dudak January 31, 2012 at 4:05pm EST
Pisses me off

Steph Dudak January 31, 2012 at 4:05pm EST
For a lot of reasons

Steph Dudak January 31, 2012 at 4:05pm EST
The sound mind, which we humans have to allow us to understand basic truths, does not accept the non-existence of God or a doubt in God's existence. Seriously?

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 4:06pm EST
yeah i ignored those comments

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 4:06pm EST
or else iwouldn't have even responded

Steph Dudak January 31, 2012 at 4:08pm EST
Three types of beliefs of god that are false

Steph Dudak January 31, 2012 at 4:08pm EST
1. Some believe that God does not exist. 2. Some believe God has a partner. 3. Some believe a "part of God" is in everything.

Steph Dudak January 31, 2012 at 4:08pm EST
Idiotic

Steph Dudak January 31, 2012 at 4:10pm EST
The thing that invalidates his entire argument is belief. That one word

Steph Dudak January 31, 2012 at 4:11pm EST
Would invalidate* but idk if he said *he* believes

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 4:11pm EST
Yeah I never argue that point

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 4:12pm EST
because they always just redefine the meaning of the word believe

Steph Dudak January 31, 2012 at 4:12pm EST
Carefully picks his words I'll give him that Yeah but that's not really a word you can redefine yk what I mean

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 4:12pm EST
i do

Steph Dudak January 31, 2012 at 4:13pm EST
I'm still reading this though, just commenting in between lol

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 4:13pm EST
its pretty long

Steph Dudak January 31, 2012 at 4:14pm EST
When someone uses their sound mind, they reach the conclusions that God must exist, and that He does not resemble the creations in any way. These are facts, not matters of opinion. Their sound mind Implying you aren't sound of mind if you reject that some sort of God exists

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 4:15pm EST
yep

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 4:15pm EST
that annoyed me too

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 4:16pm EST
I tried to sound as non confronting as possible so he wouldn't get pissed and stop replying

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 4:17pm EST
I enjoy hear other opinions, unlike hm

Steph Dudak January 31, 2012 at 4:18pm EST
There are some pretty sound of mind atheists that are extremely intelligent just sayin Thats true. Idk if I'd be able to do that How awesome would it be if someone in my class was like that kid That'd be so much fun for debates

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 4:18pm EST
i feel like playing devil's advocate sometimes

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 4:19pm EST
but i hear how people talk about eachother after debates

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 4:19pm EST
don

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 4:23pm EST
't feel like being that guy

Steph Dudak January 31, 2012 at 4:24pm EST
Well I like making people look dumb for saying certain things. It's ultimately their fault for what they make themselves come off as. I'm still trying to figure out a way to debate religion in there in a way which we haven't already done so in many of our previous debates. Btw I finished reading

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 4:25pm EST
awesome

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 4:25pm EST
and religion has been debated for a couple thousand years

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 4:25pm EST
not too many new ways to do it

Steph Dudak January 31, 2012 at 4:26pm EST
What I mean is like as far as questions goes I feel like we all have a general idea of what most people in our class believes in bc of the other debates

Steph Dudak January 31, 2012 at 4:27pm EST
And I mean literally we haven't done, as in our class

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 4:29pm EST
i'd respond, but i am not entirely sure what you are saying

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 4:29pm EST
i think you left out some words

Steph Dudak January 31, 2012 at 4:30pm EST
Meh nevermind lol unimportant. It was more of an out loud thought. But I was referring to *what* about religion. I can't be like sup. religion. Debate it.

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 4:30pm EST
ah

Nick Devlin January 31, 2012 at 4:30pm EST

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:30pm EST

Steph Dudak February 1, 2012 at 9:31pm EST
so all of her financial information and i had to explain in this section that she contributes to house stuff and other payments and whatever but the house & everything is in my old mans name.

Steph Dudak February 1, 2012 at 9:32pm EST
which all of that in itself is frustrating bc rensselaer is the only thing that required me to do that

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:32pm EST

Steph Dudak February 1, 2012 at 9:32pm EST

Thank you for your interest in Rensselaer! We know how important financial aid can be in the college decision-making process. Rensselaer's Office of Financial Aid wants to make sure you have the opportunity to receive the best financial aid package we can offer. You don't want to wait until you receive a decision on your admission to apply for financial aid. This way, should you be accepted, we will be able to provide you with your admission results and your financial aid package at the same time. If you have not already done so, you must complete the 2012-2013 CSS (College Scholarship Service) PROFILE application for us to fully evaluate your eligibility for our Rensselaer grants and campus-based aid programs. In addition, all federal aid programs require the completion of the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid). Both the PROFILE application and FAFSA can be done immediately. Our priority filing deadline for these applications in order to ensure that you receive your financial aid, should you be accepted at Rensselaer, is 2/1/2012. Here are the websites for you to visit for more information: CSS PROFILE: https://profileonline.collegeboard.com. (Our school code is 2757) FAFSA: www.fafsa.gov (Our school code is 002803) There is no charge to file the FAFSA. Depending on family income and assets, CSS Profile may allow you file the application without paying a fee. The Institute last year provided $80 million of its own funding to students to make Rensselaer an affordable investment. We encourage you to complete these applications as soon as possible. Warm regards, Office of Financial Aid

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:35pm EST
yes i've seen that one before

Steph Dudak February 1, 2012 at 9:35pm EST
specifically Both the PROFILE application and FAFSA can be done immediately. Our priority filing deadline for these applications in order to ensure that you receive your financial aid, should you be accepted at Rensselaer, is 2/1/2012.

Steph Dudak February 1, 2012 at 9:35pm EST

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:36pm EST

Steph Dudak February 1, 2012 at 9:36pm EST

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:36pm EST

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:36pm EST

Steph Dudak February 1, 2012 at 9:36pm EST
im saying for the FAFSA

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:37pm EST
yeah i gotcha

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:37pm EST
it does say priority deadline

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:37pm EST
that means if you fill it out any later you will not be a priority

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:38pm EST
they will get around to you whenever they feel like

Steph Dudak February 1, 2012 at 9:38pm EST
but i can fill it out later

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:49pm EST
do you know why?

Steph Dudak February 1, 2012 at 9:50pm EST
nope

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:50pm EST
well it turns out she did not write down that I did my essay

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:50pm EST
which she told me I got credit for

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:50pm EST
i even asked about 3 times

Steph Dudak February 1, 2012 at 9:50pm EST
i'd demand she fix it

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:50pm EST
and she said I was good

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:50pm EST
which means

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
i askedd

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
then i asked again

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
and went back later

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
and asked

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
she said it was impossible

Steph Dudak February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
what?

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
I'm gonna go ask guidance tomorrow and prove to her that it isn't

Steph Dudak February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
it's not impossible.

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
exactly

Steph Dudak February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
i've gotten a grade change

Steph Dudak February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
it's her fault

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
thus the reason for my annoyance

Steph Dudak February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
she was an idiot

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
therefore not my fault

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:52pm EST
and i shouldn';t have to take her final

Steph Dudak February 1, 2012 at 9:52pm EST
would you have had an A with that assignment in?

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:54pm EST
I am not sure it was worth a lot of points

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:54pm EST
I want to ask her that before i go to guidance

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:54pm EST
just so i don't make a ton of trouble for an 88 instead of an 86

Steph Dudak February 1, 2012 at 9:54pm EST
yeah that'd be bad

Steph Dudak February 1, 2012 at 9:54pm EST
but if it counted as more than one grade and you did good on it

Steph Dudak February 1, 2012 at 9:54pm EST
an 86 was your grade?

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:55pm EST
yeah

Nick Devlin February 1, 2012 at 9:58pm EST

Steph Dudak February 5, 2012 at 11:46am EST
gotchhhha gotcha. how much ya have done so far?

Nick Devlin February 5, 2012 at 11:46am EST
When I was very young I loved exploring the forest behind my house. Of course some might disagree with the idea that a dozen or so trees and a small stream constituted as a forest, but I was young, with the imagination of a child. I spent every day there searching for interesting rocks in the clean transparent water of the stream. I had a rule that I would never dig for rocks, only pick up ones I saw on the surface. By the time I was ten I had amassed a collection of rocks large enough to be the envy of any geologist. They were hoarded away in a secret section my closet. It was only a secret because the mess was too much for even the most fearless parent to venture into.

Nick Devlin February 5, 2012 at 11:46am EST
not very

Nick Devlin February 5, 2012 at 11:46am EST
far

Nick Devlin February 5, 2012 at 11:47am EST

Nick Devlin February 5, 2012 at 12:04pm EST
do you know how to use semicolons/ colons

Nick Devlin February 5, 2012 at 12:04pm EST
i think i need one

Nick Devlin February 5, 2012 at 12:09pm EST
Although it may have seemed unorganized to the untrained eye, there was a very complex classification system based on the most important aspects of any item in a childs collection: varying levels of how cool and or awesome the items were.

Nick Devlin February 5, 2012 at 12:09pm EST
is that right?

Steph Dudak February 5, 2012 at 12:09pm EST
Semicolons (;) Use a semicolon to separate two main clauses not joined by a coordinating conjunction: Those who write clearly have readers; those who write obscurely have commentators. We can also use a semicolon to separate main clauses joined by a conjunctive adverb (such as however, consequently, otherwise, moreover, nevertheless): A great many people may think that they are thinking; however, most are merely rearranging their prejudices. Basically, a semicolon (whether followed by a conjunctive adverb or not) serves to coordinate two main clauses. For a more detailed discussion of this mark, see How to Use the Semicolon. Colons (:) Use a colon to set off a summary or a series after a complete main clause: It is time for the baby's birthday party: a white cake, strawberry-marshmellow ice cream, and a bottle of champagne saved from another party. (Joan Didion) Notice that a main clause does not have to follow the colon; however, a complete main clause generally should precede it.

Steph Dudak February 5, 2012 at 12:10pm EST
colons, think list

Steph Dudak February 5, 2012 at 12:10pm EST
semi colon, both sides can stand alone

Nick Devlin February 5, 2012 at 12:11pm EST
everythinng else is a semicolon

Nick Devlin February 5, 2012 at 12:11pm EST
i do not know what a main clause is

Nick Devlin February 5, 2012 at 12:11pm EST
or a conjunction

Nick Devlin February 5, 2012 at 12:11pm EST
haven't learned grammar since middle school

Steph Dudak February 5, 2012 at 12:12pm EST
main clause, um independent clause. its basically just a sentence conjunctions and or but etc

Nick Devlin February 5, 2012 at 12:13pm EST
ah right conujctions i remember

Nick Devlin February 5, 2012 at 12:13pm EST
and let me restate that first complaint

Nick Devlin February 5, 2012 at 12:13pm EST
i do not know what a clause is

Steph Dudak February 5, 2012 at 12:15pm EST
http://www.chompchomp.com/terms/clause.htm

Nick Devlin February 5, 2012 at 12:18pm EST

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
i want to draw and stuff but i'm so uninspired to do so. i was in art today brainstorming ideas for my concentration and seeing what pieces i already have that fit into the theme of what lies beneath the surface / that being brought forward and i have like 4 pieces that fit that maybe. like. i guess the tear one, the hand, the confused one can fit that... I have that zipper face one i started but dunno how to finish so that's 4. i wanna redo that faceless one. but if that's the theme it also doesn't have to be just people but idk

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
IDK

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
i wanna sit down and draw but idk what i even wanna do anymore

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:10pm EST

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
it's so upsetting!

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
all right

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
so

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
and what's even more upsetting is i see all this awesome art when i'm going through tumblr for inspiration

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
what i will do

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
and it's all so great and i'm like why can i not

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
what the heck

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
this is so good

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
steph

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
but it is not inspiring me to do anything

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
sorry

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
sorry

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
never judge yourself based on others

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:13pm EST
you will end up in a ball on the ground

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:13pm EST
then see some asian kid on youtube

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:13pm EST
that does it 10X better and give that up too

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:13pm EST
true

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:14pm EST
it's not so much judging myself based off others as it is Seeing really awesome stuff but having like, artist block i guess you'd call it, myself.

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:14pm EST
makes sense

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:14pm EST
i'm about to start getting like that with juggling

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:14pm EST
talent show is soon

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:14pm EST
i havent even thought about it

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:15pm EST
soon i'll be complaining about it all the time dont you worry

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:15pm EST
but your current annoyance

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:15pm EST
is not easily solved

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:17pm EST
): that's frustrating. you'll figure it out. when is the talent show though? it shouldn't be so hard though. i guess i also have a problem with not finishing things too cause i think i'll ruin them. i need to get around to copying some of my things so i can get on that and test things on different versions. i should get some sort of paints and practice though so i can do that melty eye thing because it never works with pencils when i attempt

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:18pm EST
( btw http://coolyourjetsyo.tumblr.com/tagged/art that heart on there. made out of wood. is awesome. )

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:19pm EST
why don't you scan or take pictures of what you make, then reprint the drawings to mess with?

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:19pm EST
that's what i just said

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:19pm EST
just not as simply

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:19pm EST
that's what i have to do

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:20pm EST
ok i didn't understand

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:20pm EST
i thought you meant like completely redraw

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:20pm EST
and was concerned for your mental health

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:20pm EST
but i'm glad you didnt mean that

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:21pm EST
oh heavens no

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:22pm EST
i like that artist problem

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:28pm EST
that tag is my favorite part about my tumblr

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:28pm EST
along with http://coolyourjetsyo.tumblr.com/tagged/kitten i have like 8436 kitten tags... kitten, cat, cats, kittens. I'm bad with tags, i should make it all into one thing even though i'm sure they all contain basically the same pictures

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:29pm EST
the only thing i tagged was that 30 day challenge that took 90 days this summer

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:30pm EST
not that ive gone on tumblr in the past month in order to tag stuff

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:30pm EST
too lazy to go back and fix my tags though yeah lol i've recently started tagging stuff so i can go back and look at it when i need to

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:31pm EST
that's useful

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:31pm EST
i tend to scroll through reblogs till i find

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:45pm EST
no ones last names, if they have any, are mentioned, are they?

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:45pm EST
aside from toph

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:46pm EST
i can't remember any

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
i feel like toph has one for being in the upper

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
class

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
but zuko should have one too then

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
maybe upper class earth kingdom has it only?

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
or they just never thought about it

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:49pm EST
hm maybe

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:49pm EST
it kind of bothers me a little bit

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:50pm EST
here best explanation i found

Nick Devlin February 7, 2012 at 8:50pm EST
Aang has no last name but has a title: Avatar Aang. Katara and Sokka are peasants. They don't have a family name. Toph is the child of Earth Kingdom nobles and the nobility always has a family name. If the Fire Nation is based on the monarchy of Japan, then Zuko and Azula don't technically need a family name. The Japanese Royal Family has no family name due to historical reasons yet they do have other names.

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:50pm EST
oh well i guess that makes sense

Steph Dudak February 7, 2012 at 8:50pm EST

they have them in different sizes

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 11:41am EST
awesome

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 11:42am EST
on my list

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 11:42am EST
of stuff to get done

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 11:42am EST
along with redrawing all of my previous pieces

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 11:42am EST
because technically they are all first drafts

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 11:43am EST
and montclair wants to see 'thinking process'

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 11:43am EST
so i need rough drafts and final copy

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:45am EST
>.<

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:45am EST
so much stuff

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 11:46am EST
i had all weekend to do it too :(

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 11:46am EST
but zelda demanded my attention

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 11:46am EST
do you have ideas for your 3 pieces yet?

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:47am EST
i know how you feel

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:47am EST
i don't even know anymore.. i can't actually put anything onto paper. i

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:47am EST
m

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:47am EST
i STILL *

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:47am EST
have to redo that faceless one

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:47am EST
but

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:47am EST
i don't know how i'm going to do all those layers before it to make it better

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:48am EST
i had another idea to do a sort of aerial view of a persons head, and have it open and all sorts of designs and things coming out of it i suppose. so we're gonna try to draw that again

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:49am EST
i wish i could draw people. it's something i really need to practice. cause i still have that whole lightbulb for a head idea filled with lightbulbs but a crack so theres a trail of a bunch of other lightbulbs.

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:49am EST
which looks cool in my head

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:49am EST
but

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:49am EST
you know

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 11:49am EST
yeah

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:49am EST
that's how it always is

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:50am EST
i feel like i can't set a concentration. i dont know if any of this stuff can fit into my concentration

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:50am EST
i feel like.. it could all fit. but all of it would need explaining.

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 11:50am EST
i could never deal with that class

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:50am EST
obviously i'm not going to make every piece be someone or something tearing something in front of them away

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:50am EST
to show what's really inside them or whatever

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:51am EST
i feel like the hand and butterfly thing could fit. the brain thing. the faceless thing. even that confused one with the arrows wrapping around it.

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:51am EST
it all makes sense in my head but that's usually the problem.

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 11:51am EST
http://www.psychicdonut.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/open_mind.jpg

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 11:51am EST
that looks like it'd fit

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 11:51am EST
i just saw it while googling

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:52am EST
that's pretty cool

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:52am EST
but yaknow what i mean

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:52am EST
i still gotta redo that three section thin

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:52am EST
g

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:52am EST
over again

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:53am EST
switch the left and right sides and figure out patterns

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:53am EST
you know what else?

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 11:53am EST
hm?

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:53am EST
i bought two sketchbooks that were labeled 9"x12" and they are definitely not that size

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:53am EST
it doesn't matter

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:53am EST
but it's false advertising

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 11:53am EST
hhaha

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:53am EST
i had a 9x12 sketchbook and i actually prefer that size paper because it's not too big and not too small ya know

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 11:53am EST
those bastards

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:53am EST
that white one

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:54am EST
but it is NOT THE SAME SIZE as these green ones

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 11:54am EST
i think i know it

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:54am EST
they're more like 8x11

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 11:54am EST
sue them

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 11:55am EST
kerry just posted this http://iwsmt.littleasllc.netdna-cdn.com/February-15-2012-21-26-59-true.jpg

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:58am EST
i also had ideas for breadth pieces to do some things based off some edgar allan poe stuff.

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 11:58am EST
but. we'll see. IDK. i can't stand anything right now. i don't want to do anything. first world problems.

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 11:59am EST
those sound fun

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 12:00pm EST
people need to stop complaining omg

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 12:00pm EST
that's kind of complaining isnt it

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 12:01pm EST
but look at this

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 12:01pm EST
Domenick Sborea I never understood why everyone hated this town, but I finally understand. You're all severely immature. You hold grudges over the simplest things, and you destroy friendships. I understand it's fun to argue, but seriously, get over it. It's just added stress to our already unstable minds Like · · 12 minutes ago via mobile · Kristie Melega and 10 others like this. Michael Cappelli Facebook is full of little bitches that are to pussy to say anything they say on here to a persons face.

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 12:01pm EST
EVERYDAY SOMEONE HAS TO BITCH

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 12:01pm EST
yeah he has been blocked for a month or so now

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 12:01pm EST
all his statuses are like that

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 12:03pm EST
yeah i'm just gonna go remove a bunch of stupid people from my friends

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 12:06pm EST
always a good procrastination tool

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 12:07pm EST
is this draft-y enough?

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 12:07pm EST
yes lol

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 12:08pm EST
good

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 12:08pm EST
took forever to make

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 12:08pm EST
unfortunately i have to make a good version for real because i realize how many errors are in my original ;(

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 12:09pm EST
:'(

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 12:09pm EST
there we go

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 12:09pm EST
never had to use a cry face before

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 12:20pm EST
aww

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 12:20pm EST
poor nicholas

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 12:21pm EST
ikr

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 7:02pm EST
papers suck

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 7:02pm EST
i don't even know what to write

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 7:02pm EST
kill me please

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 7:34pm EST
I WOULD

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 7:34pm EST
but my caps were on

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 7:34pm EST
so it seems less like sarcasnm

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 7:34pm EST
and more like eagerness

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 7:35pm EST
so that's creepy

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 7:35pm EST
whats the paper for?

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 7:35pm EST
;__; Act three of othello analysis using five perspectives

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 7:35pm EST
Those green papers

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 7:35pm EST
BURN THEM

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 7:36pm EST
I WANT TO

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 7:36pm EST
SO BADLY I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO START WRITING THIS THING UGH

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 7:36pm EST
ummm

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 7:36pm EST
have you picked 5 perspectives?

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 7:37pm EST
I don't even think five can be applied to act tree

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 7:37pm EST
Three

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 7:37pm EST
Lets see

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 7:37pm EST
I'm gonna use

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 7:38pm EST
Feminist perspective

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 7:38pm EST
Cultural perspective

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 7:38pm EST
Mythological

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 7:39pm EST
do mythological first

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 7:39pm EST
i understand mythology

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 7:39pm EST
It's not mythology exactly

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 7:39pm EST
well religious aaspects then

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 7:39pm EST
or supernatural occurence

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 7:39pm EST
or superstition

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 7:39pm EST
whatever it is

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 7:41pm EST
Mythological perspective is concerned with stories that provide universal story patterns that recur with regularity among many cultures and in many different times and places. Archetypes. Things like familiar patterns of human action like dying/being born, growing up. Example is in Hamlet Hamlets revenge of his fathers death can be linked with myths from other cultures that include a sons avenging his father Themes of love and deception for example in othello

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 7:43pm EST
thats not mythology

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 7:43pm EST
but what do i know

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 7:43pm EST
i dont have a green sheet

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 7:44pm EST
Or the little essay thing that talks about the perspective

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 7:45pm EST
I guess I'll use new historical and historical as well then.

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 7:47pm EST
sounds relevant to me

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 8:01pm EST
This is why i dislike hand drawing

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
how am i supposed to test different colours?

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
i don't know why i forgot to send that sentence for 10 minutes

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
have you progressed on your essay thing

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
?

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 8:29pm EST
Not really And you use another paper

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 8:29pm EST
Color with the colors you want next to each other and if they look good use em

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 9:14pm EST
that is a good idea

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 9:14pm EST
oh well lessons for the future

Steph Dudak February 20, 2012 at 9:15pm EST
I can't believe she wants me to use five perspectives. Thank god I write big and don't need to type everything for that class

Nick Devlin February 20, 2012 at 9:18pm EST
that is a useful skill

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 10:36pm EST
I don't think I'll be sleeping tonight

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
how much have you done?

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
or rather

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
how much is left to do?

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 10:41pm EST
Too much. I don't even know what to do anymore This one I was doing was goin really well. I have a lightbulb in place of a head and the paintbrush is glowing and such and he's got a thought bubble comin out his lightbulb But idk what to put in the thought bubble. I might try to fill it with nonsense. But idk what else to do And I only thought too late that I wanted to try to do a typography thing based off The Raven, using the poem to do it of course

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
typography is always fun

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
but time consuming offline

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
put a fancy pattern in the thought bubble

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
some kind of explosiony looking thing

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
Time consuming online I already tried to start it and didn get far

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
nothing real

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
Didn't ^

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
*

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
i got that

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
what exactly you tryin to do?

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
Think of two other things I can at least start

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
I'm not worried about this lightbulb thing bc I like it so far

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
Although originally I drew it intending for it to be representative of running out of ideas

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
But then I made the inside glow

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 10:48pm EST
And lightbulbs don't turn on when you don't have ideas

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:48pm EST
so obviously they have an idea

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
You know what's unfortunate is I don't think this one would fit into my concentration

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
Just a breadth piece.

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
And I need a ton more concentration pieces. Then I was thinking I could do things other than people for my concentration

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
But because I feel the majority is people I'm not sure how I'd make a transition into something else

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:51pm EST
your concentration is under the surface or something similar right?

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 10:51pm EST
Yeah what's beneath being shown on the surface

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 10:52pm EST
Which is how I can get away with keeping some of my other things in there

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:53pm EST
what else has surfaces?

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:53pm EST
landscapes

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 10:53pm EST
I get stuck too much and I'm not confident enough in my own abilities and I wish I had paint at my disposal

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 10:53pm EST
Yeah nature

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:53pm EST
bubbles

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:53pm EST
i like bubbles

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 10:54pm EST
That just makes me think of tree people for some reason when I think about transitioning in this concentration

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:54pm EST
haha

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:54pm EST
i erally dont want to do people

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 10:54pm EST
Cause then I have that butterfly thing

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:54pm EST
how about trees?

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:54pm EST
I SHOULD DO TREE PEOPLE

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 10:54pm EST
...

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:54pm EST
sorry

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:55pm EST
thats what just went through my head

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 10:55pm EST
XD

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:55pm EST
please forgive me

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:55pm EST
awesome i'm assuming that's yes i'm forgiven

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 10:56pm EST
Yes

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:56pm EST
so nature is a good them to include

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:57pm EST
obviously emotions would be a theme

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:58pm EST
i tend to think geometrically, like surface area

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:58pm EST
i know its irrelevant but hey maybe not

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 10:58pm EST
I should turn my math homework into an art project ugh

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 10:59pm EST
I've always wanted to do something with like geometric shapes and stuff but never had an actual idea or way to go about it

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:59pm EST
i keep thinking

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:59pm EST
illlusionary type objects

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 10:59pm EST
that seems normal at first glance, but when you take a closer look are impossible

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 11:00pm EST
http://www.blogiseverything.com/files/pics/optical_illusion_01.gif

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 11:00pm EST
Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 11:01pm EST
Those are cool

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 11:02pm EST
how you could integrate them into a piece, i'm not sure

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 11:02pm EST
Maybe making a scene in nature but using this style everything would be all abstract

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 11:02pm EST
trees would work, maybe the branches could be this fucked up illusionary shit

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 11:02pm EST
idk

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 11:03pm EST
That's something I'll try to work with when I have time. Trees can be fun

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 11:03pm EST
or you just stick with the math homework idea, one the surface it seems impossible and senseless, but when you look further in you realize that some things really are the way they appear

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 11:04pm EST
The math I do in class, even though it looks ridiculous, can be applied to actual situations It's ridiculous Meanwhile using the number e

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 11:06pm EST
haha, e

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 11:06pm EST
i see that all the time in cool equations

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 11:11pm EST
Yeah it's just lovely

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 11:13pm EST
well i would never want to actually use it but it looks cool

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 11:13pm EST
like-- I was about to say 'like juggling fire'

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 11:13pm EST
but then i realized i do want to do that

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 11:13pm EST
so its a bad similie

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 11:14pm EST
I understand Nicholas

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 11:17pm EST
thank you

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 11:18pm EST
so yeah, that geometrically decieving surface might work

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 11:20pm EST
I'll try it sometime

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 11:20pm EST
but for cirrent work

Nick Devlin February 21, 2012 at 11:20pm EST
current

Steph Dudak February 21, 2012 at 11:20pm EST

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 3:02pm EST
and give you shiny things?

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 3:04pm EST
it's a 4yr program, 5 for me, that you take seven honors courses (22 credits). "These courses are Honors versions of regularly required courses in the College Studies curriculum and in your major. Classes are designed to provide intellectual challenge to our strongest students and to cover material in greater depth and breadth." "In addition to Honors course work, there are a variety of co-curricular benefits to being an Honors student. Credit can be earned, for example, through community service projects, in internships, or study aboard. There are also regional conferences to which honors students travel to present their work as well as free cultural events, extended library loan periods, and on campus activities"

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 3:04pm EST
those are the fun things i want to see

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 3:05pm EST
study abroad!!

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 3:05pm EST
better classes and cooler event

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 3:05pm EST

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 3:05pm EST
and

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 3:05pm EST

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 3:07pm EST
o.o

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 3:07pm EST
thats the more fun one i think

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 3:08pm EST
3.0 doesnt seems that hard to maintain at all

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 3:08pm EST
not at all

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 3:08pm EST
assuming that's just a normal unweighted 4.0 scale, which duh i mean what else

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 3:08pm EST
i'll be fine

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 3:09pm EST
no its out of a scale of 3

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 3:09pm EST
obviously

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 3:09pm EST
maybe 2

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 3:09pm EST
thats more resonable

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 3:10pm EST
lmao shut up

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 3:10pm EST

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 3:14pm EST
the tuition itself for philadelphia university

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 3:14pm EST

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 3:14pm EST
i understand

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 3:15pm EST
i'm actually annoyed my mom makes so much money on her own

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 3:15pm EST

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 3:15pm EST

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 3:16pm EST
oooo

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 3:59pm EST
do you think i could compress my photoshop folder with the application and everything in it, send it somewhere, decompress it on a different computer and have it work?

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 3:59pm EST
depends

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 3:59pm EST
does the other computer have photoshop?

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 3:59pm EST

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:00pm EST

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:00pm EST

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 4:00pm EST

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:00pm EST
i mean the program itself

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 4:00pm EST

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:00pm EST
i have this folder

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 4:00pm EST
sense is made

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:00pm EST
labeled photoshop cs4

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 4:00pm EST

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:00pm EST

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:01pm EST

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:01pm EST
idk

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:01pm EST
few years

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 4:01pm EST

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:01pm EST
i was gonna say

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:01pm EST

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:02pm EST
i'm curious because

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 4:02pm EST
it might not work because it has the same liscense numer

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:02pm EST
i was thinking. eventually i might have to get a laptop for something. and what if i wanna do ps and illustrator related stuff on it

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:02pm EST
def not buying cs5

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:02pm EST

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:03pm EST

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:05pm EST
the other flaw being

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:06pm EST
too large of a file to send through anywhere or upload on mediafire without an account upgrade

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 4:06pm EST
can you zip the file?

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 4:06pm EST

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:06pm EST
winrar

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:07pm EST
i already compressed it

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:07pm EST
all i need to do is right click on it and hit compress file and it does it

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:08pm EST
all zip'd up

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 4:08pm EST
ah

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 4:08pm EST
thats annoying

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:08pm EST
why is that annoying

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:08pm EST
that i can easily zip files?

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 4:08pm EST
that it is too large still

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:09pm EST
oh

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:09pm EST
yeah i know

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:09pm EST
hm i should check how big it is

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 4:10pm EST
thats what i was just gonna ask

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:10pm EST

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:15pm EST
Upload in progress 2% 4.36Mb of 223.71Mb 00:00:40 elapsed, 00:38:20 left 141.41Kb/sec (97.9Kb/sec avg)

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:15pm EST
lol

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 4:15pm EST
so how do i get that file?

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:16pm EST

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:16pm EST
i shouldn't upload photoshop on there

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:16pm EST
that i illegally downloaded

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 4:17pm EST

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 4:27pm EST
the link you can send to me

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 4:27pm EST
and it should work

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:28pm EST

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 4:28pm EST
you gave up?:

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:29pm EST
yes lol

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 4:29pm EST
ah well

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:29pm EST
knowing my luck it'd be more than taken down. i'd probably just get thrown in jail or something

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 4:29pm EST
makes sense to me

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:30pm EST
be the exact opposite of what my family expected

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:30pm EST

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 4:36pm EST
assumption made

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 4:36pm EST

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 4:36pm EST
ugh

deleting everything and retrying

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 5:01pm EST
I hope that one works. That'd be really cool. It's a shame that forum no longer exists and I didn't save those links.

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 5:01pm EST
Because it had dreamweaver photoshop and illustrator I think it even had um. One other thing I can't think of that was useless to me

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 5:07pm EST
i remember

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 5:10pm EST
Would be more useful. You can't create 3d text and stuff in photoshop. It's nice to have that and illustrator as well

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 5:10pm EST
Though I can't figure out how to make actual lines in illustrator. Just the paths. Which is ridiculous But anyway

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 5:12pm EST
i am not able to do this

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 5:12pm EST

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 5:12pm EST

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 5:15pm EST
Ask for photoshop when you graduate Say it's essential to your life And it's the best investment that could be made in you One of them

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 5:15pm EST

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 5:15pm EST
but i really cant

Steph Dudak February 23, 2012 at 5:15pm EST
Yeah I know that's not very realistic lol

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 5:16pm EST
not only that but i feel like i wouldnt use it

Nick Devlin February 23, 2012 at 5:16pm EST

Nick Devlin February 24, 2012 at 10:41pm EST
so i can fix

Nick Devlin February 24, 2012 at 10:42pm EST
whenever you are able

Nick Devlin February 24, 2012 at 10:43pm EST
My name is Nicholas Devlin. I am a senior at Toms River High School East. I have brown hair, blue eyes, and stand a bit over five and a half feet tall. All these description may be accurate and describe me, but do not elaborate on the kind of person I am. The best way I know to succeed in that effort is to list the things I love to do and the reasons I like to do them. Some of my biggest interests are juggling and coding programs using systems like Java and C++. These two pursuits may seem unrelated in every way, but I disagree. Both need focus and attention. Most of my day is spent multitasking and being able to take a break by learning a new trick or designing a program to play poker are both ways to simultaneously stimulate and relax my thoughts. Art in all its forms is the same way. It is very difficult and time consuming, but somehow it still retains a quality of calmness, assuming it is not on a deadline. Then you can just throw the calm and peace right out the window and magnify the difficult part a hundred times over. This is not a bad thing though, challenges are what make art so interesting. I have always had an interest in art, but had never believed it would be anything more than a hobby. However, when I started taking the Computer Graphics and Design classes at my school I discovered how much art and design went into all the things around us. I began noticing all the intricate details that everything from posters and commercials to t shirts and cereal boxes. I realized that there had to be many people involved with creating it all, and that maybe having a career in an artistic field was not as farfetched as I had first imagined. My main goal in terms of a career is to get a steady job, perhaps working for a single company or for multiple. I like the options I have if I choose to work in this field. There are so many places around the world where I could work and I also like that I have the option to work at home if I so chose. I feel as though there are so many different possibilities for my future with Graphic Design as my major. It is obvious that I am not overly concerned about the specific details many years in the future. My priorities right now are to learn and become skilled enough to be flexible enough to adapt to many different work environments. I do not like being dependent on one skill set. I would much rather prefer to have a broad range of abilities that are useful and able to get me any job that comes across my path, which, I think, is pretty much the point of college.

Nick Devlin February 24, 2012 at 10:43pm EST
I feel like its a bit informal but ignore that for now

Steph Dudak February 24, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
Will do

Nick Devlin February 24, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
gracias!

Nick Devlin February 24, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
i mean merci

Steph Dudak February 24, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
De rien

Nick Devlin February 24, 2012 at 10:52pm EST
the adjective form of that word is "piddling"

Nick Devlin February 24, 2012 at 10:52pm EST
which i found hilarious

Steph Dudak February 25, 2012 at 3:25am EST
Descriptions* plural Take out pretty much the point of college. Just reword it. Otherwise I like it. Hopefully it's not my reading it at 3:30 am thats saying that, so I'll read it and revise again in the morning as well assuming I awake at a descent time

Nick Devlin February 25, 2012 at 7:13pm EST
thank you!

Nick Devlin February 25, 2012 at 7:13pm EST

Steph Dudak February 26, 2012 at 9:19pm EST
and it'll be weird because we'll have been in the middle of a conversation

Steph Dudak February 26, 2012 at 9:19pm EST
and sometimes what i say actually fits into that wrong conversation, but it makes me sound awful

Steph Dudak February 26, 2012 at 9:19pm EST
as a person. usually

Nick Devlin February 26, 2012 at 9:20pm EST

Nick Devlin February 26, 2012 at 9:20pm EST

Steph Dudak March 8, 2012 at 8:05pm EST
Pixels lol I feel like itd be a tedious project

Steph Dudak March 8, 2012 at 8:05pm EST
Like stippling

Nick Devlin March 8, 2012 at 8:06pm EST
Very. I wouldn't have the patience

Nick Devlin March 8, 2012 at 8:07pm EST
Stippling is better than crosshatching though. I never could do crosshatching

Steph Dudak March 8, 2012 at 8:11pm EST
True story. I hate cross hatching probably cause I'm no good at it and or I just learned how to properly do it this year

Nick Devlin March 8, 2012 at 9:41pm EST
You actually learned how to do it?!

Nick Devlin March 8, 2012 at 9:41pm EST
You gotta teach me one day

Nick Devlin March 8, 2012 at 9:41pm EST
I've never had it explained

Nick Devlin March 8, 2012 at 9:41pm EST
besides shading with lines

Steph Dudak March 8, 2012 at 9:41pm EST
the week i was in mrs k's class

Steph Dudak March 8, 2012 at 9:41pm EST
the first assignment was to do those little box exercises

Steph Dudak March 8, 2012 at 9:42pm EST
where you fill em using the different techniques

Nick Devlin March 8, 2012 at 9:42pm EST
mhm

Steph Dudak March 8, 2012 at 9:42pm EST
and that was one of them and she did it on the board

Nick Devlin March 8, 2012 at 9:44pm EST
that's eciting

Nick Devlin March 8, 2012 at 9:44pm EST
you need to explain it to me one day

Nick Devlin March 8, 2012 at 9:45pm EST
I really want to learn, but not from online

Steph Dudak March 8, 2012 at 9:45pm EST
they're kinda like perpendicular lines

Steph Dudak March 8, 2012 at 9:45pm EST
that's why a lot of times when people crosshatch incorrectly they think of it just as making like x's and stuff yaknow

Steph Dudak March 8, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
it's kinda like perpendicular lines, different spaces, and can overlap and intersect sometimes

Nick Devlin March 8, 2012 at 9:47pm EST
interesting

Steph Dudak March 10, 2012 at 8:39pm EST
NICHOLAS I AM SO MAD

Steph Dudak March 10, 2012 at 8:40pm EST

Nick Devlin March 13, 2012 at 9:26pm EDT
Don't live like there's no tomorrow. Live your life like it's a story you want to tell someone else. This quote from Philip DeFranco is one of my favorite quotations because it describes perfectly how I feel life should be lived. I want to be able to say Ive done something with my life. One of the best ways to describe someone is to tell a story about them, and if there is no story to tell, then there is not much to know about that person. I do not want to be a person without a story. I want to be able to say I made an impact and have affected things around me. I go to as many activities as possible, and assist them with whatever they need. I am able to be a regular member of many organizations like the Debate Team, Strategy club, and Math League, with more active roles in Ping Pong, and Asian Heritage club as well. I created the Juggling club because I love to juggle and really want to teach as many people as possible how to juggle, because it is such a simple and interesting talent to have. The more serious activities I am involved with include being part of the Chess Team and a member of the Color Guard, both of which can take over 10 hours every week. They seem to have a contradictory nature in being both very individual sports that force you to pay attention to your personal responsibilities while playing, but still focus on being a part of a team and working together. One of the biggest reasons Im involved with so many things in School is because I like helping people do things. I almost always do a better job on projects when I am helping someone else as opposed to doing my own work. I enjoy volunteering with events for my church, or school, and especially at the library. At the library I often attend events and occasionally volunteer with things such as SAIL and Reading Buddies, during the summer. But one of the best ways I have been able to find ways to volunteer is the youth group I have been a part of since I moved to Toms River in 2nd grade. I constantly receive opportunities to volunteer from being a part of youth group. Ive helped serve food at soup kitchens, organize food drives, clean up and set up for services, and have taken care of children at Vacation Bible School. this summer I will be going to New Orleans in order to help rebuild.

Nick Devlin March 13, 2012 at 9:26pm EDT

Steph Dudak March 13, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
i'll look at that in a sec

Steph Dudak March 13, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
does the word club need to be capitalized? i noticed you capitalized Team and League but not the clubs. They seem to have a contradictory nature in being both very individual sports that.... I don't like the wording there. in being both idk it sounds weird to me. school should not be capitalized in the last paragraph, first sentence. I enjoy volunteering with events for my church, or school, and especially at the library. no comma after church should be and instead of or, you do both. just take out or actually. church, school, and especially... Bible School. this summer I will be going to This* capitalize

Nick Devlin March 13, 2012 at 9:43pm EDT

I have to go over circles mainly. I think I pretty much have ellipses down cause we've been doin that all week

Steph Dudak March 15, 2012 at 9:03pm EDT
But It feels like forever since I've done circles

Nick Devlin March 15, 2012 at 9:05pm EDT
what's new that you are learning about circles?

Steph Dudak March 15, 2012 at 9:07pm EDT
It's equations of circles and garbage. Like. Write an equation of a circle with center (-4,2) r=radical7 Pts (8,0) & (0,6) are end pts of the diameter. There's ones with tangent and y intercepts. Then there's systems and then there's ones where you need to give the center and radius

Steph Dudak March 15, 2012 at 9:07pm EDT
Prove things like the midpoint of AB is perpendicular to AB

Nick Devlin March 15, 2012 at 9:08pm EDT

Nick Devlin March 18, 2012 at 5:03pm EDT
". I woke up early today to attend a Lip Dub (a style of music video) that my schools Television Production class is producing. I was there to help set up and clean up, along with juggling in parts of the video. After we finished cleaning, I went to the library to shoot a video for that same TV production class about Youth Art Month that will display all the projects made by students, including a portrait I painted. "

Nick Devlin March 18, 2012 at 5:03pm EDT

Nick Devlin March 18, 2012 at 9:05pm EDT
what are the rays coming from the left side?

Steph Dudak March 18, 2012 at 9:07pm EDT
They're gonna be shades of green Probably some sort of designs For no purpose other than to look pretty I might make the island in pencil and then have those rays and the doors be in color

Nick Devlin March 18, 2012 at 9:07pm EDT
that works

Nick Devlin March 18, 2012 at 9:07pm EDT
and is that a bush? or a tree?

Steph Dudak March 18, 2012 at 9:08pm EDT
It's a tree that I'm fixing as I'm typing this

Nick Devlin March 18, 2012 at 9:09pm EDT
funfun

Nick Devlin March 18, 2012 at 9:09pm EDT
i was going to mention

Nick Devlin March 18, 2012 at 9:09pm EDT
that it's a tad stumpy

Steph Dudak March 18, 2012 at 9:10pm EDT
It is lol

Steph Dudak March 18, 2012 at 9:10pm EDT
It might look a little better now hold on

Steph Dudak March 18, 2012 at 9:10pm EDT
Might need to fix it a bit again

Nick Devlin March 18, 2012 at 9:11pm EDT
so this the actually piece you will be drawing on and everything

Nick Devlin March 18, 2012 at 9:11pm EDT
?

Steph Dudak March 18, 2012 at 9:12pm EDT
Yeah cause Idw redraw everything Did you have a suggestion you'd like to make about it

Nick Devlin March 18, 2012 at 9:13pm EDT
the door

Nick Devlin March 18, 2012 at 9:13pm EDT
too pointy

Nick Devlin March 18, 2012 at 9:13pm EDT
unless you are going for a certain style

Nick Devlin March 18, 2012 at 9:13pm EDT
that i cant see yet

Nick Devlin March 18, 2012 at 9:13pm EDT
but right now

Nick Devlin March 18, 2012 at 9:13pm EDT
meh

Steph Dudak March 18, 2012 at 9:13pm EDT
I'm fixing that too actually lol I don't like the shape

Nick Devlin March 18, 2012 at 9:14pm EDT
you'll obviously be detailing the island and stairs with shading and whatnot

Nick Devlin March 18, 2012 at 9:14pm EDT
so that's fine

Nick Devlin March 18, 2012 at 9:14pm EDT
a question though

Nick Devlin March 18, 2012 at 9:14pm EDT
are those stairs cut into the island

Nick Devlin March 18, 2012 at 9:15pm EDT
or are they jutting out?

Steph Dudak March 18, 2012 at 9:17pm EDT
They're like out. You'd be able to step on them. You know if they were shaped right. I need to fix the angle most of the steps are at though. They should be getting wider as they go from bottom to top Know what I mean I drew it without thinking about it

Nick Devlin March 18, 2012 at 9:18pm EDT
i know what you mean

Nick Devlin March 18, 2012 at 9:18pm EDT
grr

Nick Devlin March 18, 2012 at 9:18pm EDT
how to explain

Steph Dudak March 18, 2012 at 9:18pm EDT
Some of these middle branches have to not start so low I think but I think it's a little better than it was before

Nick Devlin March 18, 2012 at 9:19pm EDT
it looks a little better

Nick Devlin March 18, 2012 at 9:19pm EDT
what kind of tree is it?

Nick Devlin March 18, 2012 at 9:19pm EDT
it looks sorta like the methusalah tree

Steph Dudak March 18, 2012 at 9:20pm EDT
It's just a tree

Steph Dudak March 18, 2012 at 9:20pm EDT
Idk I just drew it lol

Nick Devlin March 19, 2012 at 9:51pm EDT

Nick Devlin March 19, 2012 at 9:51pm EDT
if you were not wearing it

Nick Devlin March 19, 2012 at 9:51pm EDT
then i do not think you had it

Steph Dudak March 19, 2012 at 9:53pm EDT
Yeah I had Drew check his car again, apparently it's not in there. Hopefully I left it in Schindlers otherwise I left it in the media center or It dropped outside and I was unaware and no one told me. I hope that didn't happen

Nick Devlin March 19, 2012 at 10:41pm EDT

Steph Dudak March 20, 2012 at 7:30pm EDT
So what are the odds that How we want to see things vs how they actually are / coexistence of reality and fantasy Would be an appropriate concentration

Nick Devlin March 20, 2012 at 9:03pm EDT
50/50 talk to her when shes in a good mood and you have multiple projects completed

Steph Dudak March 20, 2012 at 9:05pm EDT
I have to talk to her ASAP. I dont have time for that bc I it ends up its not, then I'll need to start over and I'll have an excess of breadth pieces.

Steph Dudak March 20, 2012 at 9:05pm EDT
I have ideas and I can use some things I already have. Well more of the later things im working on. They fit together in my head but that's the problem.

Steph Dudak March 20, 2012 at 9:05pm EDT
Everything makes sense in my head

Nick Devlin March 20, 2012 at 9:06pm EDT
Good luck with that.

Steph Dudak March 20, 2012 at 9:06pm EDT
Thaaanks

Nick Devlin March 20, 2012 at 9:07pm EDT
If you need me to tell you what wont make sense I'll have no problems criticising

Steph Dudak March 20, 2012 at 9:09pm EDT
I appreciate that. Can I go over it with you during lunch tomorrow if she for once okays something I want to do?

Nick Devlin March 20, 2012 at 9:10pm EDT
Of course

Nick Devlin March 20, 2012 at 9:11pm EDT
courseI apologize in advance for whatever dickish things I say

Steph Dudak March 20, 2012 at 9:12pm EDT

Nick Devlin March 20, 2012 at 9:14pm EDT
On the random news front, Sara will be hometomorrow and should be in school by next week

Steph Dudak March 20, 2012 at 9:16pm EDT
Yay! That's good news

Nick Devlin March 20, 2012 at 9:19pm EDT

Nick Devlin March 20, 2012 at 9:20pm EDT
Quick question

Steph Dudak March 20, 2012 at 9:20pm EDT
Ask away

Nick Devlin March 20, 2012 at 9:20pm EDT
What do you do in art class?

Nick Devlin March 20, 2012 at 9:20pm EDT
Like the actual period? Just around

Nick Devlin March 20, 2012 at 9:20pm EDT
Or talk about art or learn new mediums?

Steph Dudak March 20, 2012 at 9:22pm EDT
Work on art Watch mrs Calicchio and dishon mess with each other Calicch will mention random things sometimes That's really it. We barely talk to each other all of us. Like generally, we're pretty quiet. Jess does nothing ever though

Nick Devlin March 20, 2012 at 9:23pm EDT
Jmm thought it was something like that

Nick Devlin March 20, 2012 at 9:23pm EDT
Alright thanks

Steph Dudak March 20, 2012 at 9:25pm EDT
No problem

Nick Devlin March 21, 2012 at 11:48pm EDT
I tend to help out whenever possible. You never know what small things can lead to a big change. Something as insignificant as waiting 3 extra seconds to hold the door for someone behind you can make that persons entire day. Just the idea that 3 seconds can influence an entire day is astounding. Imagine the changes that could be made by spending hour or weeks dedicated to a particular cause or event. bleepity bloop blorp blughenstein wtf with all the b alliterations? weird shit man what time is it? 11:44? how the fuck is it not even midnight. didnt i used to stay up till like 2 am back in the day? oh right that was before i woke up at like 5am every morning. maybe if elephants could train my homework its do itself better then me cuz i cant at all whatd happen if i turned this in/? haha theyd just send me me to the snake oit under one of there desks i know its there so many typos even my ramble i feel the urge to correct fuck i ll use whatever their i want whenever i want screw the purple line FIGHT THE MOARCHY OF COLORED UNDERLINES

Nick Devlin March 21, 2012 at 11:48pm EDT
I'm going certifiably insane. Do you think if i show this to my teacher's they will let me out of school for a wekk to just sleep 24/7

Nick Devlin March 21, 2012 at 11:48pm EDT
ugh

Nick Devlin March 21, 2012 at 11:49pm EDT

Nick Devlin March 21, 2012 at 11:50pm EDT

Nick Devlin March 21, 2012 at 11:56pm EDT

Steph Dudak March 21, 2012 at 11:57pm EDT
If I'm feeling fancy I'll wear the one dress I own

Steph Dudak March 21, 2012 at 11:58pm EDT
Otherwise it's that purple and black shirt with a pair of boots and some sort of nice looking pants or something. Which is actually what mother nature suggested.

Steph Dudak March 21, 2012 at 11:58pm EDT
"I don't care wear whatever you want. You could wear that black and purple shirt you like and a pair of boots or something you know." Rambling

Nick Devlin March 21, 2012 at 11:59pm EDT
i would never interrupt your rambling

Nick Devlin March 21, 2012 at 11:59pm EDT
that'd be more hypocritical than like fox news

Steph Dudak March 22, 2012 at 12:04am EDT
It's okay I'm pretty much done

ive been trying to get my world affairs project completely together since 10:30 this morning

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 1:38pm EDT
i finally got it to export out of keynote and import into imovie properly and guess what?

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 1:38pm EDT
my project was 13 minutes long

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 1:38pm EDT
so now, i gotta go back and fix it because if i leave it, i'll get marked a grade down for it being over 10 minutes.

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 2:51pm EDT
your life sucks

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 2:51pm EDT
a lot

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 3:41pm EDT
Yep

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 4:54pm EDT
at least we agree

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 4:55pm EDT
what did you remove, or did you shorten the clips

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 4:56pm EDT
I removed one thing from history that was pretty insignificant and I made the transitions 1.5 sec instead of the 2 it was at and made sure pretty much every slide was 7 sec

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 4:57pm EDT
I shortened it to 11:23

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 4:57pm EDT
...

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 4:57pm EDT
so another minute still?

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 4:57pm EDT
That's as good as its getting. It's only a minute over so if he takes a grade off for that he can go fuck himself

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 4:57pm EDT
It's already on the DVD

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 4:58pm EDT
i like that way better

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 4:58pm EDT
I spent 6 hours importing and exporting over and over

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 4:58pm EDT
I wasn't about to do it a 6th time

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 4:58pm EDT
yeah i can imagine

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 4:58pm EDT
All meanwhile my computer did that stupid black screen thing

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 4:58pm EDT

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 4:58pm EDT

!!!!!

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 8:25pm EDT
GOT IT

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 8:25pm EDT
Leave the bubble blank

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 8:26pm EDT
Although certain people might look like they have all the answer and have this great idea

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 8:26pm EDT
they actually don't know anything!!!

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 8:27pm EDT
done

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 8:27pm EDT
emmy please

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 8:29pm EDT
I want to leave it blank

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 8:29pm EDT
But it seems unfinished

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 8:29pm EDT
put like an empty field or some shit

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 8:29pm EDT
something to indicate lack of thought

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 8:30pm EDT
But My concentration is officially What we want to see vs what's actually there Bc of that it turns into coexistence of reality and for lack of a better word, fantasy That way I can draw non real like things Like that island And get away with it

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 8:30pm EDT
fantastic

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 8:31pm EDT
i'm so funny

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 8:31pm EDT
fantastic

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 8:31pm EDT

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 8:33pm EDT
Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 8:33pm EDT
I think the only thing that'll be color is the door

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 8:33pm EDT
And I'll do the other two squiggly things like the bottom ones

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 8:33pm EDT
i think that works

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 8:34pm EDT
did you think about using like different techniques?

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 8:34pm EDT
stippling

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 8:34pm EDT
Not sure what they are exactlly I just think they look cool

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 8:34pm EDT
Well I want them all to be done the same way

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 8:34pm EDT
!!!!!

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 8:34pm EDT
STIPPLING

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 8:35pm EDT
Shit that'll take forever

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 8:35pm EDT
But

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 8:35pm EDT
i thgink it'd look cool

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 8:35pm EDT
In there Could be a normal thing

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 8:35pm EDT
Done up not normal

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 8:36pm EDT
restate

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 8:36pm EDT
don't understand

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 8:36pm EDT
I could do some sort of plain thing inside that bubble and stipple the whole thing

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 8:36pm EDT
Instead of actually drawing something

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 8:36pm EDT
ahhh

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 8:36pm EDT
Or

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 8:37pm EDT
understanding

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 8:37pm EDT
Do something using geometric shapes

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 8:39pm EDT
Or something

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 8:41pm EDT
that works

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:08pm EDT
why have you not read othello nicholas

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:08pm EDT
why

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:08pm EDT
because I am not entirely insane

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:08pm EDT
i saw sassy gay friend version though

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:08pm EDT
and coded the game othello

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:08pm EDT
if those help

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:09pm EDT
uhhhh probably not

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:09pm EDT
i'm writing a paper on theme development

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:09pm EDT
hmm

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:09pm EDT
yeah

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
i don't think i'll be able to assist you

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
neither can morgan apparently

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
i wrote an outline right

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
and idk we need like TECHNIQUES for theme development

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
one of the themes i wrote about was pride

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
she wrote nice!! next to it

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
and at the end

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:11pm EDT
(his death and his murder of Desdemona (and other deaths as well.) and no longer the "honorable" death of military victory for the state - now fueled by self-interest!)(an interesting idea...)

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:11pm EDT
with a giant

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:11pm EDT
techniques-? but sensitive reading! :)

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:11pm EDT
next to it

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:12pm EDT
the parentheses stuff is what she wrote after one of my notes that said 2. Diminishing pride throughout play leads to death

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:14pm EDT
what does techniques mean?

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:14pm EDT
irony diction and stuff?

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:14pm EDT
ready this is my paper so far

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:14pm EDT
i'm scared

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:15pm EDT
oh it's so bad too

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:15pm EDT
any grammatical suggestions are greatly appreciated

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:15pm EDT
btw

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:15pm EDT
no prob

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:15pm EDT
Many techniques are used to develop multiple themes in Shakespeares Othello. Two major themes that are developed are appearance vs reality and pride. Appearance vs reality is one of the major themes of Othello and is most apparently shwon by the characters of Iago and Desdemona through Shakespeares use of irony. Throughout Othello, nearly every character refers to Iago as honest. The word itself is used very often in the play, especially as Iagos actions worsen, but is used ironically. Iago, as the audience knows, is anything but honest and focuses on trying to ruin the lives of all the characters -- mainly Othello. He is only honest when he is alone. However, in scene one of act one, Iago says to Rodeigo I am not what I am, which provides foreshadowing as well as it being one of the very few times he actually is being honest around other people. The theme of appearance vs reality is first introduced here as Iago admits to being the exact opposite of what he appears to be. Desdemona is another character through which the theme is developed. So much time is spent throughout the play to build up Desdemonas appearance as innocent, pure, beautiful, and basically perfect. This changes once Iago falsely tells Othello that Desdemona has been cheating on him with Cassio because it leads Othello to believe that Desdemona is suddenly the opposite of everything he believed her to be -- everything she was described as up until this point. This situation is ironic as well because Desdemonas purity and honesty is not just an appearance. Everything she has been described as is exactly how she is as a person. However, Iago is the one that is truly dishonest and deceitful and should be placed in the position Desdemona is in; that is, Iago should be the one that Othello wants to get rid of. Because Othello believes in the way everything appears to be, he sets himself and the other characters up for disaster. His belief that Iago is honest and Desdemona is the opposite of everything he has thought her to be leads him to have Cassio and Desdemona killed. It is only after Othello kills Desdemona that he finds out she had been honest all along and Iago had been lying the entire time, resulting in Othello killing himself for what he has done. The irony here is that as far as we know, Iago is only arrested at the end of the play-- it is unclear what actually happens to him. This could be seen as Iago getting off with a warning or as the villain getting away. Another important theme developed throughout Othello is a theme of pride, which is primarily shown in Othello himself because it is also his tragic flaw. that giant space, is to be continued space. idk how to end that stuff about iago.

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:16pm EDT
vs has a period after it

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:17pm EDT
first sentence

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:17pm EDT
"are use to develop *the many* themes ..."

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:18pm EDT
multiple is weird

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:18pm EDT
see

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:18pm EDT
i avoided many

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:18pm EDT
because many is the first word lol

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:18pm EDT
i felt redundant

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:20pm EDT
oh didn't notice that

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:20pm EDT
just take out multiple ?

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:20pm EDT
"there are multiple techniques used to develop the many themes

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:20pm EDT
yeah

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:20pm EDT
that's silly

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:21pm EDT
just takes out the adjetive to descreibe how many

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:21pm EDT
Many techniques are used to develop themes of appearance vs. reality and pride in Shakespeares Othello.

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:21pm EDT
yes

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:23pm EDT
shown is spelled wrong

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:24pm EDT
omg not even

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:24pm EDT
schwon

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:24pm EDT
did i write that

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:25pm EDT
mhmm

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:25pm EDT
i don't feel that there is much more to say about iago

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:26pm EDT
i just feels like it ends weirdly

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:26pm EDT
i mean you have proven quite cleary his connection to your theme

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:26pm EDT
wasn't sure if i could get away with leaving it just like that or not

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:27pm EDT
found the incorrectly spelled shown

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:33pm EDT
meh i think it's fine

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:34pm EDT
"However, Iago is the one that is truly dishonest and deceitful and should be placed in the position Desdemona is in; that is, Iago should be the one that Othello wants to get rid of."

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:34pm EDT
that

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:34pm EDT
so awkwardly phrased

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:34pm EDT
i mean it makes sense

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:34pm EDT
but yeah you could explain it better

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:35pm EDT
probably

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:37pm EDT
uh

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:37pm EDT
hm

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:37pm EDT
?

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:37pm EDT
trynna figure how to word it properly

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:39pm EDT
"It is only after Othello kills Desdemona that he finds out *that* she had been honest all along and *that* Iago had been lying the entire time, *which results* in Othello killing himself for what he has done. "

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:39pm EDT
i don't know why the *that*s need to be everywhere but it sounds empty without them

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:40pm EDT
i hope they actually have to be there then

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:40pm EDT
and i had which results written on my paper so idk why i wrote resulting lol

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:40pm EDT
who knows

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:41pm EDT
i think you need a transition between your two points

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:41pm EDT
of pride and appearance

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:41pm EDT
I'm thinking you can realte Othello's pride

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:41pm EDT
i'm awful at transitions generally

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:41pm EDT
relate*

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:41pm EDT
it can be

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:41pm EDT
to appeareance

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:41pm EDT
related

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:41pm EDT
pretend that was one coherent sentence

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:41pm EDT
there i go talking like yoda

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:41pm EDT
anywho

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:45pm EDT
Here

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:45pm EDT
best i got

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:45pm EDT
"A closely intertwined theme developed throughout this play is the pride shown by Othello which causes his faith in the facades of those around him. This pride becomes his tragic flaw"

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:45pm EDT
or something

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:45pm EDT
edit it to actually make sense to someone who has read the book

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:46pm EDT
yeah bc his pride links with him wanting to look powerful which is extremely important to him and in an attempt to keep that he fucks everything up

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:46pm EDT
exactly

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:46pm EDT
but that's an excellent transition nicholas

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:46pm EDT
why thank you!

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:46pm EDT
you should help me with those more often cause i suck at them

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:46pm EDT
a lot

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:46pm EDT
i never use them in my own work

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:47pm EDT
i can only write them for other people

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:47pm EDT
its highly irritating

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:47pm EDT
but they are fun to make

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:47pm EDT
so anytime you need help

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:47pm EDT
just ask

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:49pm EDT
what's a more sophisticated way to say

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:49pm EDT
as the play goes out or you know as the play plays out

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:49pm EDT
the second just sounds dumb

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:50pm EDT
throughout the course of the play

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:50pm EDT
umm

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:50pm EDT
idk give me the entire sentence with the stupid phrase so i can use context

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:51pm EDT
[Othello is very proud of himself and his achievements, which becomes more obvious blahblahblahblahblah] something like this

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:51pm EDT
because

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:51pm EDT
okay no let me explain first

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:52pm EDT
in the beginning, othello is very well spoken and is um... there's a word for it. he doesn't put himself down, but he like downplays himself as a person. he's modest but that's not what i'm looking for says he's rude in his speech and blahblah when really he speaks eloquently and smoothly and respectfully and. he's just great at talking. which eventually deteriorates too as iago fucks with his head and he's ready to kill desdemona. passion overrides his ability to talk and he becomes a man of action instead of word

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:52pm EDT
s

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:53pm EDT
mkay

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:53pm EDT
Othellos is more humble in the beginning?

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:54pm EDT
yeah basically

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:54pm EDT
like

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:54pm EDT
he still is aware of his achievements

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:54pm EDT
and points out how all he really knows is war and junk

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:54pm EDT
i understand

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:54pm EDT
i mean he's never really like

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:54pm EDT
oh ho ho look at me

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:55pm EDT
but as it plays out, what happens with him and desdemona hurts his pride, so he feels like now he has to show that well i am a man and i'm powerful and no one fucks with this nigga

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:55pm EDT
gotcha

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:57pm EDT
either way it has to fit somewhere after that transition

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:57pm EDT
At the start of the play Othello's attitude is one of a man who is self-assured in himself, but not one to boast of his talents and acheivements. Throughout the course of the play his bruised ego cause him to lapse into a much baser character that feels it necessary to display his strength in order to reassure himself of his skill.

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:58pm EDT
minor errors in that statement but it is along those lines

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:58pm EDT
you are fabulous

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 10:58pm EDT
i know

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 10:59pm EDT
baser tho

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:00pm EDT
base2 [beys] bas·er, bas·est, noun adjective 1. morally low; without estimable personal qualities; dishonorable; meanspirited; selfish; cowardly.

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:00pm EDT
yeah baser

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:00pm EDT
synonyms

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:01pm EDT
it was the best word i could think of the means less of a good person

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:01pm EDT
but not a complete dick

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:01pm EDT
then again he killed his wife

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:01pm EDT
i don't have as wide a vocabulary as you do nicholas lol. there's quite some difference between how i write and how you write i'll use it

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:02pm EDT
say you used a thesaurus

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:02pm EDT
which technically i might as well be

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:02pm EDT
so it won't be a complete lie

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:02pm EDT
the only unfortunate thing about this

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:02pm EDT
is i'm not talking about any sort of technique

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:03pm EDT
idk any techniques used to develop this theme. it's just obvious that it's developed

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:03pm EDT
i wish i could write that

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:04pm EDT
list techniques

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:04pm EDT
idk what any are

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:05pm EDT
idk but she noted on the appearance one "Theme development techniques here- diction, irony?"

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:05pm EDT
and circled like the whole iago thing

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:05pm EDT
well you mention irony often

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:05pm EDT
and diction i'm guessing you could just mention how Othello speaks differently in the beginning and his speech patterns change

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:06pm EDT
hmm i might be able to do that

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:06pm EDT
once again have to pick out the dumb one liners he uses

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:06pm EDT
O monstrous! O monstrous!

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:06pm EDT
exactly

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:07pm EDT
O blood, blood, blood!

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:08pm EDT
Death and damnation, O! god shut up othello i hate this

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:08pm EDT
, = !

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:08pm EDT
commas are exclamation points?

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:08pm EDT
I'll tear her all to pieces

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:09pm EDT
the comma i put in that last one

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:09pm EDT
was supposed to be an exclamation point

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:09pm EDT
Death and damnation! O!

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:09pm EDT
O!thello is retarded

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:10pm EDT
i

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:10pm EDT
will allow

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:10pm EDT
this one time

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:10pm EDT
lol

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:10pm EDT
because i actually did

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:10pm EDT
hahahaha yesss

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:10pm EDT
ugh i feel dirty saying that

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:10pm EDT
LOL

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:10pm EDT
sorry

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:10pm EDT
it's okay

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:11pm EDT
it's okay

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:11pm EDT
i will make it

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:13pm EDT
hmm

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:13pm EDT
i just realized that i kind of like writing essays

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:13pm EDT
not formal ones

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:13pm EDT
but

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:13pm EDT
informal essays are pretty much just books

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:14pm EDT
i think i'll need to start writing more

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:14pm EDT
i cannot stand how everything othello omg like it's all bc iago tells him desdemona has been cheating on him with cassio

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:14pm EDT
othello suddenly becomes an idiot

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:14pm EDT
iago's talking to him and othello's like naaaah my wife's perfect and pure and wonderful and SHE picked ME yo

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:14pm EDT
and then he's like

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:14pm EDT
making the character change to fit the plot

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:14pm EDT
basic laziness

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:14pm EDT
ffffffffff her handkerchief was in cassio's room

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:15pm EDT
/rage

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:15pm EDT
even tho i didnt see it lol

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:15pm EDT
but iago sed it was there

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:15pm EDT
so he must be rite

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:15pm EDT
even tho i said ill believe it wen i see it

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:15pm EDT
proof shmoof

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:15pm EDT
typical dumb black guy

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:15pm EDT
-.-

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:15pm EDT
i'm so good at interpretations

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:15pm EDT
oh so many way i can exploit you

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:16pm EDT
lmfao

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:16pm EDT
i could just screen cap this

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:16pm EDT
blur out a couple lines

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:16pm EDT
and fun will be had

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:17pm EDT
explaining plays like that

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:17pm EDT
makes them feel more relatable which sounds absolutely stupid

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
no

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
it doesn't

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
but its not

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
that's how literature works

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
i should rewrite othello

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
ACTUALLY

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
LOL

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
there was this thing once

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
i'm pretty sure they ahve

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
in some form or anothe

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
where it was like "What was said" in othello and what it means

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
r

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
in normal speak

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
normal speak

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
yeah

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
ok

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
mhmm

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:19pm EDT
and it was slightly sarcastic at points and kind of hilarious

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:19pm EDT
it was awesome

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:19pm EDT
i like those things

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:20pm EDT
I wish our school's AP classes were like real AP

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:21pm EDT
so i could actually take them and not be afraid that my teacher's disorganization and annoying way of teaching would ruin my grades

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:21pm EDT
i don't know what real AP is

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:21pm EDT
i have a feeling i should be failing morgans

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:21pm EDT
but i get straight As

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:21pm EDT
somehow

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:23pm EDT
i have this misinterpreted dreamland version of ap

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:23pm EDT
where it's like a challenging class

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:23pm EDT
without much homework because it's mostly done in class

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:23pm EDT
and there isn't busy work

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:24pm EDT
oh yeah that thing

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:24pm EDT
but actually interesting topics

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:24pm EDT
i've heard of that once

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:24pm EDT
i've never experienced it

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:24pm EDT
yeah i was close

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:24pm EDT
marotto's class

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:24pm EDT
was good for that

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:25pm EDT
i learned most of my math from her

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:25pm EDT
because she knew how to teach

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:25pm EDT
i actually think she was like my best teacher

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:25pm EDT
like ever

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:25pm EDT
weird

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:28pm EDT
math teachers yo

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:28pm EDT
not goodall

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:28pm EDT
dziedzic is one of my favorite teachers

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:28pm EDT
and mrs maison

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:28pm EDT
in 8th grade

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:28pm EDT
made us sing songs to remember things which we all thought were sooo stupid at the time but i used those in 9th grade algebra, i did. i don't remember any of them now really.

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:29pm EDT
i remember little things you have to RISE before you RUN. change in y over change in x = slope apples with apples oranges with oranges no fruit salad

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:29pm EDT
i have a few of those things

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:29pm EDT
but they're all from the internet

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:30pm EDT
like improper fractions is the worst i think

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:30pm EDT
it was some guy on youtube

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:30pm EDT
sex is like fractions

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:30pm EDT
improper for the larger one to be on top

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:33pm EDT
tru fax tho

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:33pm EDT

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:36pm EDT
http://i43.tinypic.com/wvzp0l.png http://i42.tinypic.com/t8klm8.png put a 2px black border around both of those, upload, and send me the links pretty please?

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:37pm EDT
preferably so the borders are around the outside. not like covering anything on those images know what i mean if you can

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:37pm EDT
no prob

Steph Dudak March 25, 2012 at 11:38pm EDT

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:40pm EDT
but it's two pixels on paint

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:40pm EDT
so

Nick Devlin March 25, 2012 at 11:40pm EDT
whatever

cous is supposed to be like cshortened cousin because some people say it like they would say bro

Nick Devlin March 28, 2012 at 9:53pm EDT

Nick Devlin March 28, 2012 at 11:33pm EDT
don't try to help people

Steph Dudak March 28, 2012 at 11:34pm EDT
She makes it sound like the producers of twilight will ruin it

Steph Dudak March 28, 2012 at 11:34pm EDT
First of all

Steph Dudak March 28, 2012 at 11:34pm EDT
Invalid argument

Steph Dudak March 28, 2012 at 11:35pm EDT
The twilight movies are based off the books. And they're actually pretty good representations of them even though the whole franchise as a whole kind of sucks

Nick Devlin March 28, 2012 at 11:35pm EDT
polish a turd

Nick Devlin March 28, 2012 at 11:35pm EDT
still a turd

Nick Devlin March 28, 2012 at 11:35pm EDT
the tried their best

Steph Dudak March 28, 2012 at 11:35pm EDT
Stephanie Meyer came up with the whole sparkly vampires and whatever the fuck. She put it in writing, someone just made it so you can see it

Steph Dudak March 28, 2012 at 11:36pm EDT
It's not that they turned this awesome book into some weird awful horrible thing

Nick Devlin March 28, 2012 at 11:37pm EDT
I finally used acquiesce in a sentence :)

Nick Devlin March 28, 2012 at 11:37pm EDT

Steph Dudak March 28, 2012 at 11:40pm EDT

Nick Devlin March 28, 2012 at 11:41pm EDT

Nick Devlin April 1, 2012 at 7:08pm EDT
You are to hand it in before the deadline given on the cover sheet

Nick Devlin April 1, 2012 at 7:08pm EDT
not the actually application

Nick Devlin April 1, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
ACTUAL****

Nick Devlin April 1, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
THAT ANNOYS ME

Nick Devlin April 1, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
i don't even think the word actually

Nick Devlin April 1, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
it just gets written for NO REASON

Nick Devlin April 1, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
uhg

Nick Devlin April 1, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT

Nick Devlin April 1, 2012 at 7:10pm EDT
d

Steph Dudak April 1, 2012 at 7:10pm EDT
Well that's what I mean Let's say the sheet says the deadline is 04/15/12

Steph Dudak April 1, 2012 at 7:10pm EDT
Can you hand it in that day

Steph Dudak April 1, 2012 at 7:10pm EDT
Obviously thats not even a school day I just made up a date

Nick Devlin April 1, 2012 at 7:10pm EDT

Nick Devlin April 1, 2012 at 7:11pm EDT
so say the scholarship is the Principal's Leadership Scholarship or something

Nick Devlin April 1, 2012 at 7:11pm EDT

Nick Devlin April 1, 2012 at 7:12pm EDT

Nick Devlin April 1, 2012 at 10:08pm EDT
i figure it's the same as reading any font

Nick Devlin April 1, 2012 at 10:09pm EDT
i just think that visual recognition is impressive as a physical characteristic of humans.

Steph Dudak April 1, 2012 at 10:09pm EDT
any idiot can figure it out i think. i mean. 5's look like S's 7's look like T's 0's look like O's 1's look like I's

Nick Devlin April 1, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
i like how people can read capitols and lowercases and cursive and handwriting all without much difficulty

Steph Dudak April 1, 2012 at 10:13pm EDT

Nick Devlin April 1, 2012 at 11:08pm EDT

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 8:24pm EDT

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 8:24pm EDT
Niiiiiick

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:26pm EDT

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
Yay!

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
Ok

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
I didn't get to ask you at lunch. I need an opinion

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
on?

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
Can you see the background designs?

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
barely

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
but holy shit

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
that right side

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
This any better ?

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
i get the general idea of the lines

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
The right is just straight lines do

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
So *

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
Oh right my question

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
Duh so

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT
I'm not sure what colors I wanna use for the background on that side

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT
If I stick with the same ones, it'll blend in too much and Do not want

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:31pm EDT
yes

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:31pm EDT
hmm

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:31pm EDT
Also Should I outline the designs in black too? And color the insides

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
the background designs should be outlined yes

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
but maybe less thick

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
Thought so too. I'll

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
and the colours....

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
Yeah I was gonna say

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
hmmm

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
I'll make those thinner or the outside outline of the person thicker

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:33pm EDT
Thinner, Calicch has fancy pens I can use for that lol

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:33pm EDT
always go with the option that has fancy things

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:34pm EDT
would complimentary colours work? for the background

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:34pm EDT
blues and purples?

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:34pm EDT
I was thinking about that Hesitated only bc the eye

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:34pm EDT
Then I was thinking of putting in green in the back with them

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:34pm EDT
But

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:34pm EDT
yrah the green muight mess

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:34pm EDT
The only red is the cheek

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:35pm EDT
So

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:35pm EDT
but i don'rt think it'll be that bad

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:36pm EDT
Purples and blues might work well I'm probs gonna have to test it on another paper

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:36pm EDT
good idea

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:36pm EDT
Now

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:37pm EDT
I was thinking of having each section fade Not just be like flat blue flat purple

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:37pm EDT
Have the blues and purples mixed in in each section maybe fading

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:37pm EDT
Left to right I dunno But then

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:37pm EDT
The right side

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:38pm EDT
Those plain grey stripes. I think I'll do just one solid shade of grey ?

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:38pm EDT
i think that by the end

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:38pm EDT
it should be

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:38pm EDT
like around the face would be

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:38pm EDT
but slow it should transition into more exciting colours

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
so near the colourful face would be much more vibrant and flashy then become greyer and more muted and blended together as they go left

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
so near the colourful face the colors should be very distinct

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
just an idea

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:40pm EDT
That's what I mean But I mean like on the right have no shading

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:40pm EDT
Just flat grey when it hits the other end

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:40pm EDT
Obviously I'll have to transition and have the middle be duller colors

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:41pm EDT
here

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:42pm EDT
Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:42pm EDT
up until the blck line can be flat grey

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:43pm EDT
past that i think there should be very subtle alterations in tone

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 9:46pm EDT
Hm hm hm

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:55pm EDT
ugh my facebook is breaking

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 9:55pm EDT

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 10:27pm EDT
that's not good

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 10:36pm EDT
Not at all I wish these blues and purples were brighter and not as dark

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 10:44pm EDT
use electric blue

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 10:44pm EDT
and a magenta

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 10:44pm EDT
but more purply

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 10:44pm EDT
maybe not electric but you know what i mean

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 10:51pm EDT
Yeah

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 10:51pm EDT
Most of the blues are dark and then there's aquamarine and light aqua

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 10:52pm EDT
Which don't fit with the purples

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 10:52pm EDT
not really

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 10:52pm EDT
And I used those two in the eyes

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 10:52pm EDT
So

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 10:52pm EDT
I have

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 10:53pm EDT
True blue, which is the blue I used in that tear face thing Peacock blue Violet Parma violet And mulberry

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 10:53pm EDT
Peacock blue is kind of a stretch FRUSTRATING

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 10:54pm EDT
yeah, you tend to be much better at color selection thatn i

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 10:55pm EDT

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 10:59pm EDT
IS SHE SERIOUSLY

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 10:59pm EDT
"Screw it. I'm done looking through this idiotic meme site that insults numerous people going to East, including people I know. Final straw: calling everyone in Skills Club (AKA Strategy Club) autistic."

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 10:59pm EDT
That's the opening statement in her essay bashing the meme sight

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 11:00pm EDT
She's in strategy club

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 11:00pm EDT
mhmm

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 11:00pm EDT
Yo doesn't mr tierney run that

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 11:00pm EDT

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 11:01pm EDT
Are you friends with noelle Lopez?

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 11:02pm EDT
no

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 11:02pm EDT
She used to go to east but she goes to south now but one was made about her. And it was (incorrectly spelled btw) Noel Lopez Y u no look good in person or something along those lines.

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 11:03pm EDT
i saw that one

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 11:03pm EDT
Needless to say she was not happy and I don't really blame her I think the whole thing is ridiculous And this is why we can't have nice things and why kids that go to our school shouldn't be allowed on the Internet

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 11:05pm EDT
south is almost as bad

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 11:06pm EDT
i haven't gone back onto east

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 11:06pm EDT
but judging from from people's comments they are just douchey

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 11:06pm EDT
south is jsut stupid

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 11:06pm EDT
It's being updated like every five seconds. You go to the next page and it's the same ones you just read on page one

Steph Dudak April 2, 2012 at 11:06pm EDT

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 11:09pm EDT

Nick Devlin April 2, 2012 at 11:10pm EDT

on a desk or something

Steph Dudak April 4, 2012 at 9:53pm EDT
all shaded nicely and have "IDEAS" written on the paper

Steph Dudak April 4, 2012 at 9:55pm EDT

Nick Devlin April 4, 2012 at 9:55pm EDT

Nick Devlin April 4, 2012 at 9:55pm EDT
if you say so...

Steph Dudak April 4, 2012 at 9:56pm EDT

Nick Devlin April 4, 2012 at 10:02pm EDT

Nick Devlin April 4, 2012 at 10:02pm EDT

Nick Devlin April 9, 2012 at 11:14pm EDT
boredom

Steph Dudak April 9, 2012 at 11:14pm EDT
I should've guessed that

Steph Dudak April 9, 2012 at 11:14pm EDT
Enneyeux I think Is bored in French

Nick Devlin April 9, 2012 at 11:14pm EDT
its when you literally lack the desire to do things. Like When I wish I wanted to

Nick Devlin April 9, 2012 at 11:15pm EDT
Origin: 166070; < French: boredom; Old French enui displeasure;

Steph Dudak April 9, 2012 at 11:15pm EDT
Yep

Nick Devlin April 9, 2012 at 11:15pm EDT
that was an odd copy and paste, it reattached my half erased message

Nick Devlin April 9, 2012 at 11:15pm EDT
anyway

Steph Dudak April 9, 2012 at 11:17pm EDT
I'm going to hand all these in And then she's gonna say "what about disorders" "you can do better"

Nick Devlin April 9, 2012 at 11:17pm EDT
probsbly

Steph Dudak April 9, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
"but now it's too late" *thunder*

Nick Devlin April 9, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
how about the manifestation of mental disorders

Nick Devlin April 9, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
it has some big words so you can't go wrong

Nick Devlin April 9, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
plus it's almost aliterative

Steph Dudak April 9, 2012 at 11:20pm EDT
Perhaps. See like

Steph Dudak April 9, 2012 at 11:21pm EDT
I could go from more abstract to tangible things And Not just mental disorders

Steph Dudak April 9, 2012 at 11:21pm EDT
I mean

Nick Devlin April 9, 2012 at 11:22pm EDT
you should do one on Cerebellar Hypoplasia

Steph Dudak April 9, 2012 at 11:22pm EDT
My idea for bipolar is cliche It's just a bunch of makes Mainly it gives me an excuse to draw my masquerade mask But That's a tangible thing it's just an object

Steph Dudak April 9, 2012 at 11:23pm EDT
Whereas

Steph Dudak April 9, 2012 at 11:23pm EDT
Foor

Steph Dudak April 9, 2012 at 11:25pm EDT
Borderline personality the idea was to have a bunch of random designs and stuff that represent different feelings or emotions at least how I see them. But the bottom right corner of the page is drawn to look like the page is being turned and "underneath it" is going to be either the silhouette or outline of a person Representing a sort of dissociation With their own emotions and blah blah

Steph Dudak April 9, 2012 at 11:26pm EDT
And detachment *

Nick Devlin April 9, 2012 at 11:26pm EDT
that's good

Steph Dudak April 9, 2012 at 11:27pm EDT
And then for ADHD I have an in between thing

Steph Dudak April 9, 2012 at 11:28pm EDT
It's a cube. With different things on each side idk what. But the top is open. And a bunch of things are coming out of it and around the page I was thinking of having random doodles and some little things in there that look unfinished

Steph Dudak April 9, 2012 at 11:29pm EDT
Change in subject, lack of focus and interest in finishing what was started bc of other things

Nick Devlin April 9, 2012 at 11:30pm EDT
makes sense

Nick Devlin April 9, 2012 at 11:31pm EDT
I am searching my tumblr for something awesome and relevant to what you are doing

Steph Dudak April 9, 2012 at 11:37pm EDT

Nick Devlin April 9, 2012 at 11:55pm EDT

Steph Dudak April 9, 2012 at 11:55pm EDT
Thank you :p hahaha sorry Have fun sleeping, goodnight!

Steph Dudak April 10, 2012 at 6:26pm EDT
I feel like the stuff I associate with other stuff makes no sense Do wanna see this uncolored drawing so far

Steph Dudak April 10, 2012 at 6:26pm EDT
do you*

Nick Devlin April 10, 2012 at 6:26pm EDT
of course

Steph Dudak April 10, 2012 at 6:28pm EDT
It's a little hard to see some of the stuff. Meh. It feels empty to me but I think it'll fill up once it's colored. I haven't put the person in the corner yet I have a feeling I'll have to redo this one though just because no one will really understand what I'm trying to get across with it. It all makes sense in my head. Doesn't it always. I'm putting that on my tombstone

Steph Dudak April 10, 2012 at 6:31pm EDT
In the corner there's an eye and tears. Sadness. The swirl and flower are just things I think are pretty. Swirly water and sun , peaceful Flames around part of the flower, anger The circles are not full therefore incomplete Those lines inbetween the petals are like confusion But they're just things I represent these things with. I feel like calicch thinks I try to make it seem like. General? With my work? And how other people would or could feel? But I don't.

Nick Devlin April 10, 2012 at 7:12pm EDT
i think calicch's opinion isn't really important

Nick Devlin April 10, 2012 at 7:12pm EDT
just as long as you finish it

Nick Devlin April 10, 2012 at 7:12pm EDT
and have an explanation

Nick Devlin April 10, 2012 at 7:12pm EDT
that makes sense to you

Nick Devlin April 10, 2012 at 7:13pm EDT
The big problem you keep saying she has is that you always leave things half done

Nick Devlin April 10, 2012 at 7:13pm EDT
just finish all your shit

Nick Devlin April 10, 2012 at 7:13pm EDT
and she'll be happy

Nick Devlin April 10, 2012 at 7:13pm EDT
plus i remember you said she likes your design oriented doodling ones

Steph Dudak April 10, 2012 at 7:15pm EDT
Oh I'll have it finished I'm just worried about it not feeling coherent when a scorer or someone looks at it with the others It's more just based off that one specific part of bpd so. Whatever. Yeah I gotcha

Nick Devlin April 10, 2012 at 7:17pm EDT
it reminds me of some of the others

Nick Devlin April 10, 2012 at 7:17pm EDT
like the one with the house

Nick Devlin April 10, 2012 at 7:17pm EDT
and th shrooms

Nick Devlin April 10, 2012 at 7:17pm EDT

Nick Devlin April 10, 2012 at 7:17pm EDT

Nick Devlin April 10, 2012 at 7:19pm EDT

Steph Dudak April 10, 2012 at 7:21pm EDT
No I don't feel like they really fit The shrooms one potentially could But I'd still needa redo it

Nick Devlin April 10, 2012 at 7:26pm EDT
yeah

Nick Devlin April 10, 2012 at 7:26pm EDT

WITCHCRAFT

Nick Devlin April 10, 2012 at 8:53pm EDT
YES

Nick Devlin April 11, 2012 at 8:11pm EDT
A midsummers Night Dream is a comedic play about different relationships between a wide variety of people. The play starts off by introducing the audience to Theseus, who is to be wed to Hippolyta in a few days. They are planning aspects of the wedding when suddenly interrupted by Egeus who brings with him his daughter, Hermia, and her two suitors, Lysander and Demetrius. Egeus desires Demetrius to be her husband, but Hermia prefers Lysander. Theseus decides that Hermia must either accede to her fathers choice or become a nun, which causes Hermia and Lysander to elope. Lysander and Hermia are traveling through a forest, but unbeknownst to them Demetrius was following them, and Helena, who had an unreciprocated love for Demetrius, was following him. In that same forest a group of craftmen were practicing a play they hoped to put on for Theseus wedding. This crowded forest also contained the king and queen of the fairies, Oberon and Titania, were fighting over the possession of an Indian boy they kidnapped. Oberon decided to play a prank on Titania by having his jester, Robin, give her a lover potion that made her fall in love with the first thing she saw, which happened to be the most boisterous man in the play, Bottom. Robin also turned his head into that of an ass, just for fun. Oberon also had Robin use the potion on Lysander and Demetrius who now both were in love with Helena whereas before they both loved Hermia. Chaos ensues until Oberon has had enough and settles the entire debacle by keeping Demetrius in love with Helena, returning Lysander and Hermias love, and removing the love potion from Titania. The conclusion of the play consists of the entire cast mocking the play created by Bottom and the other craftsmen.

Steph Dudak April 11, 2012 at 8:16pm EDT
Lysander and Hermia are traveling through a forest, but unbeknownst to them Demetrius was following them, and Helena, who had an unreciprocated love for Demetrius, was following him. I have a problem with this sentence. I think it's the ... Are traveling Cause then you say Demetrius was Idk it sounds weird to me.

Nick Devlin April 11, 2012 at 8:17pm EDT

Steph Dudak April 11, 2012 at 8:17pm EDT

Steph Dudak April 17, 2012 at 9:16pm EDT

Nick Devlin April 17, 2012 at 9:16pm EDT
makes sense

Steph Dudak April 17, 2012 at 9:18pm EDT
I could probably get this one done tonight or at least the majority and then I should probably draw the rest first. So after this I have 6 to go!

Nick Devlin April 17, 2012 at 9:26pm EDT
50% completion

Nick Devlin April 17, 2012 at 9:26pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 7:00pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 7:00pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 7:01pm EDT
oh

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 7:01pm EDT
word

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 7:01pm EDT
nick i have no brain anymore

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 7:01pm EDT
it's okay

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 7:01pm EDT
i haven't been able to pick up on clever little things lately

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 7:01pm EDT
wasn't harry's a dementor though

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 7:01pm EDT
not in the first meeting

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 7:02pm EDT
harry wasn't allowed because lupin thought it would be voldemort

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 7:02pm EDT
word word gotchu

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 7:02pm EDT
dementer would have been funnier though

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 7:06pm EDT
how are you doing with your things?

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 7:07pm EDT
eh

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 7:07pm EDT
i'm at my grams right now

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 7:07pm EDT
going home in a little bit

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 7:07pm EDT
i'm really nervous that i'm not gonna finish everything

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 7:08pm EDT
obviously it's something out of my control and it's my fault for letting it happen but you know i'm also nervous that some of these, don't. i don't wanna say accurately, but for lack of a better word yeah accurately, depict the disorder i'm going for

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 7:08pm EDT
i understand what you mean

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 7:08pm EDT
like it makes sense to me. but it doesn't matter if it makes sense to me because it's the people grading it that it has to make sense to. and i mean i ask people i'm friends with for opinions on my pieces and i tell em what it is and blahblahblah and they'll be like oh yeah i get it it's awesome but i feel like some of them

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 7:08pm EDT
not you really

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
are just saying it cause they're my friends

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
and aren't giving me any real criticism cause then i walk into physics and carolyn stumbles upon whatever i have done

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
but i hate when she looks at my art projects

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
i feel her judging me hardcore and i can tell she doesn't like most of what i do which i don't care she can fuck off but it's annoying

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 7:10pm EDT
Cause explaining to her what goes through my head and how a certain piece even remotely makes sense

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 7:10pm EDT
just

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 7:10pm EDT
no

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 7:11pm EDT
she does that "eeuuuuhhhhh mmmm ahljdh" thing But that's one person But also calicch hasn't seen ANY of this stuff So I'm scared about that too But that's another thing I just need to deal with I mean at least I'll have stuff handed in

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 7:11pm EDT
Although I know the quality of some of it isn't the best it could be

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 7:12pm EDT
it is the best it can be at your current pace

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 7:12pm EDT
and I understand that other people undestanding it might be somewhat important

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 7:13pm EDT
but really

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 7:13pm EDT
half the shit in museums i have no clue what it means till someone explains it

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 7:13pm EDT
you also have a very centralized concentration

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 7:14pm EDT
people don't really know disorders off the top of their heads

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 7:14pm EDT
i could not tell you the difference between mulitple personality and bipolar and schiztophrenia

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 7:14pm EDT
without it being explained a bit

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 7:15pm EDT
and my job is to know random crap like that

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 7:19pm EDT
I guess I'm just really worried about stuff like that. Next to each other, they look like they kinda work. I think just cause all the colors and stuff yaknow. I just hate explaining these projects to actual people around me. Kerry & Carolynn are the worst cases. I'll be able to type up the thing I have to type up and explain what I'm thinking with each thing.

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 7:20pm EDT
that should be simpler

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 7:20pm EDT
as long as you don't fuss over every phrase

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 7:21pm EDT
no no. i mean i won't have to talk about every ingle piece indiividually. but i will be able to refernce certain things about certain pieces cfor c

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 7:22pm EDT
oh even better!

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 7:22pm EDT

computer works slower than i do and likes to freeze up and be an asshole apparently

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 7:23pm EDT
yeah, I've learned to make my speed match the tech around me

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 7:24pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 7:32pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 7:32pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 7:32pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 10:12pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 10:12pm EDT
would you still talk to me

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 10:12pm EDT
no

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 10:13pm EDT
i have purposely detatched myself from people who write like that

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 10:13pm EDT
on at least 3 occasions that i can remember

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 10:15pm EDT
good

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 10:16pm EDT
http://www.rgbstock.com/cache1pJuNt/users/t/ta/tacluda/300/mP3OIEU.jpg can this be repeated

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 10:16pm EDT
like tiled

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 10:16pm EDT
of course

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 10:16pm EDT
in what sense though

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 10:17pm EDT
like interlocking the petals

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 10:17pm EDT
yes

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 10:17pm EDT
hmmm

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 10:17pm EDT
i'll look again

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 10:17pm EDT
i feel like it couldn't, just on its own

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 10:17pm EDT
there will be empty spaces

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 10:17pm EDT
but idk

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 10:17pm EDT
triangular

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 10:17pm EDT
i can deal with that

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 10:18pm EDT
you can fit 6 around it

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 10:18pm EDT
it'll be a somewhat hexagonal pattern

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 10:19pm EDT
it also will not interlock the petals in a perfect way since there are an even number of petals

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 10:21pm EDT
hm yeah not good

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 10:23pm EDT
it'll take a bit of fudging

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 10:23pm EDT
what are you trying to do?

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 10:24pm EDT
use something similar for one of my projects

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 10:25pm EDT
oh that's easy then

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 10:25pm EDT
if you are making it yourself then you can change it to make it work

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 10:37pm EDT
funfun

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 10:38pm EDT
i love those types of designs

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 10:38pm EDT
like diagrams

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 10:38pm EDT
since ocd is all detailed

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 10:40pm EDT
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/GreenCircleFractal.png i really like this thing though. the center circle. http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs32/f/2008/204/4/a/Circular_Motion_by_Expercf.jpg this is really cool http://a1.s6img.com/cdn/box_001/post_11/208027_5681160_ll.jpg that's a cute already been done thing

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 10:54pm EDT
they have entire tutorials onhow to create circles with specific meanings

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 10:54pm EDT
the different patterns do different tasks

Nick Devlin May 3, 2012 at 10:54pm EDT
and the inclusion of symbols further specifies what the magic does

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 10:57pm EDT
one second

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 10:57pm EDT
omg

Steph Dudak May 3, 2012 at 10:59pm EDT
some more changes would have to be made like the inside pattern but http://i45.tinypic.com/2w37z2d.png

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:11am EDT

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:12am EDT

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:12am EDT

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:12am EDT
maybe you can eat or something silly in that extra 4

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:13am EDT
This is impossible and I'm completely screwed

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:13am EDT
Steph just get as much done as you can

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:13am EDT
She knows that you are behind yes?

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:14am EDT
Nick I HAVE to have everything done by Monday because shes photographing them If I'm a project short or something I'll make up some bullshit that I left it at home

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:14am EDT
yes i understand that

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:14am EDT
but will she only be photography them ALL in one day?

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:14am EDT
Yes

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:15am EDT
she can't do more the next day?

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:15am EDT
if so why?

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:15am EDT
She probably could but I can't tell her that I still have more to finish because I was supposed to have everything done last week

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:15am EDT
Monday she's photographing so we have Tuesday and Wednesday to upload and edit everything online

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:16am EDT
In class I still need to mount my five quality pieces

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:16am EDT
Which are what I need to hand in on Friday

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:17am EDT
Everything else needs to be finished and submitted to calicchio before that

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:17am EDT
that sucks

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:17am EDT
I don't know what else to tell you

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:18am EDT
There's nothing anyone can tell me cause I let it happen so whatever

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:18am EDT
Will there be anything horrible due next week?

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:18am EDT
after this Friday it'll mostly be over yeah?

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:19am EDT
Can I send you the 8 I have done though And can you tell me if it looks like it'd fit into a concentration? And yeah I had a fuckload of hw to do. I have a world affairs test on Monday I haven't studied for I have ap lit practice stuff to do that I haven't done yet Mostly it will be yeah But I have a physics test next Monday that I need to get a good grade on

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:19am EDT
GREAT!

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:20am EDT
Then we can spend time on how I have nothing done and I wasted all my time on stupid things!

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:20am EDT
That's not until next week though

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:20am EDT
so I still have time to procrastinate

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:20am EDT
and of course

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:20am EDT
send away

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:20am EDT
ADD

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:21am EDT
Borderline personality

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:21am EDT

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:21am EDT
Schizophrenia

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:21am EDT
Bulimia (pretend like that's finished)

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:22am EDT
Synesthesia

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:22am EDT
Multiple personality

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:22am EDT
General insanity

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:22am EDT
And sounds like a plan haha

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:24am EDT
hmmm the only one that doesn't really fit is the insanity one

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:24am EDT
all the rest have random designs and colours everywhere

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:24am EDT
that one is much more simple

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:24am EDT
Well I need to somehow make it work

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:25am EDT
well when you compare it to synestesia

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:25am EDT
it's similar

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:26am EDT
and the brain itself have similar patterns to what you do

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:26am EDT
just put it after synestesia and you should be good

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:26am EDT
Well I still have four more that I can use to transition into that

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:27am EDT
What if I did OCD kind of like the brain one. Like. Inside the head have a detailed repeating design of some sort Just not shaped like a brain and filling the whole thing

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:28am EDT
Or a hand or something

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:28am EDT
Drawing

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:29am EDT
Im just iffy on doing that bc the rest except add have like a head or something in it

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:30am EDT
I was going to say that you should put a more simple one after like occ

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:30am EDT
ocd

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:31am EDT
fruedian slip

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:31am EDT
so that'd probably work

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:32am EDT
So head or hand for OCD And then I have depression And bipolar And a fourth thing

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:32am EDT
I liked Julie's idea for bipolar with the shadows of the person

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:32am EDT
I contemplated pyromania I really just don't wanna Do anxiety

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:33am EDT
pyromania

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:33am EDT
funfun

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:35am EDT
I think I'm gonna try to do that one

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:36am EDT
do it

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:36am EDT
i said that in a funny voice

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:36am EDT
i hope you heard it

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:37am EDT
I read it in one

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:37am EDT
I gotchu

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:37am EDT
good

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:37am EDT
But okay depression That can be my gateway simpler one

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:39am EDT
makes sense

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:46am EDT
Somehow You know I don't think I can take stuff from my concentration and my breadth for my quality pieces. Only from one section

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:46am EDT
odd

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:47am EDT
which has more pieces ou like?

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:48am EDT
I'm gonna have to check on that. Neither really I don't feel like any of my stuff is good enough. I'm gonna use the butterfly one and the one with the tears I think But. Idk the thing is they need to be "technically well done" I kind of just do what I want with these. I have like the minimum amount of pieces for everything. My painting isn't good enough. I wish I had more outside stuff but oh we'll

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 8:48am EDT
Like stuff that wasn't going in my portfolio already

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:51am EDT
i have no

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 8:51am EDT
idea

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 9:05am EDT
So hand or head for OCD

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 9:06am EDT
umm

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 9:06am EDT
head might be easier

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 9:06am EDT
unless you literally trace your hand

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 9:07am EDT
Take a picture of what I want it to look like and then print it out and trace it lol

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 9:08am EDT
then i am not sure

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 9:08am EDT
umm

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 9:09am EDT
hand?

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 9:09am EDT
I just feel like I'd have to do other body parts as a result Like everything's a body shape or a head or face Then Bam Hand

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 9:09am EDT
just to be different

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 9:09am EDT
if you want it to be the same i'd go with head

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 9:09am EDT
That shows profession actually Hand

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 9:09am EDT
Progression

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 9:09am EDT

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 9:10am EDT

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 9:10am EDT
anytime

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 9:14am EDT
Somethin like that? The pencil could be an actual pencil like a colored pencil or something And then yeah Stuff being drawn and stuff y/n

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 9:15am EDT
that'd look cool

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 9:20am EDT
Cool cool ty!

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 10:32am EDT
My drawings officially make no sense

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 10:32am EDT
Just to give you an update

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 12:47pm EDT
i thank you

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 12:47pm EDT
for the update

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 12:50pm EDT
I fixed it. It's making sense. Unfortunately I dont have a ruler in my house for some reason

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 12:50pm EDT
Which is important to have for this one

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 12:51pm EDT
interesting

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 12:51pm EDT
the hand i mean

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 12:51pm EDT
the lack of ruler is annoying

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 12:51pm EDT
have you learned nothing from comp graphics and design?!

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 12:52pm EDT
rulers are for pussies

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 12:52pm EDT
Lmao

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 12:52pm EDT
I'm making boxes though

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 12:52pm EDT
Squares

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 12:52pm EDT
Not boxes

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 12:52pm EDT
And they need to be perfect

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 12:53pm EDT
yeah, and we learned how to make perfect circles and squares and lines in that class

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 12:53pm EDT
plus you can just make a straightedge

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 12:53pm EDT
and print out a ruler if you are that desperate

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 12:54pm EDT
That was like 3 years ago ok

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 12:54pm EDT
yeahh

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 12:54pm EDT
but my other points are still valid

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 12:54pm EDT
They are I remember nothing

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 12:55pm EDT
it's all i learned in high school

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 12:58pm EDT
Obviously it's a useful skill to have

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 12:59pm EDT
better than foiling

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 12:59pm EDT
oh! marrato taught me fractions

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 1:00pm EDT
i learned that

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 1:24pm EDT
Fractions are good

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 1:24pm EDT
Should I color this hand like normal skin

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 1:25pm EDT
I went over the numbers with a thin sharpie like pen

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 1:25pm EDT
yeah

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 1:25pm EDT
i think so

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 1:25pm EDT
unless you have other option for the coloring?

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 1:25pm EDT
and i expected you to do that

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 1:26pm EDT
No I didn't really have an alternative idea

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 1:26pm EDT
then go with it

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 1:26pm EDT
Just didn't know if I wanted it to look like skin lol The face in bulimia is silver and black

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 1:26pm EDT
Meh

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 1:27pm EDT
well you could make it coloured randomly with designs

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 1:27pm EDT
but unles you have ideas, I'm not sure you should waste time trying to think of colour patterns

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 1:29pm EDT
Nope

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 1:29pm EDT
I do however

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 1:29pm EDT
Need to think of the colors for the squares

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 1:29pm EDT
Every seventh is going to be a specific one

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 1:40pm EDT
awesome idea

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 1:41pm EDT
Im gonnna use blue pink violet and yellow Every seventh will be yellow And the pattern will be bbppvvYvvppbbYbbppvvYvvppbb Etc

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 1:43pm EDT
funfun

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 1:43pm EDT
I live it in my head

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 1:43pm EDT
so i'll like even more when i see your drawing of it

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
Not a recent picbut does it look weird skin colored

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
yeah a little

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 3:41pm EDT
all the numbers have a different texture

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 3:43pm EDT
I'm not good at specifics with realistic drawing

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 3:43pm EDT
hmm add more shading?

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 3:43pm EDT
it doesn't seem to have any depth like shadows or anything

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 3:44pm EDT
They're light but I'll do that

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 3:44pm EDT
The goal wasn't for it to look realistic though

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 3:45pm EDT
the outline of the hand is realistic so it messed me up

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 3:45pm EDT
like you have all the lines for a more detailed hand but are missing the shadows

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 3:45pm EDT
so i'ts kinda flat

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 3:46pm EDT
this is from the computer pic though, so there might be some I can't see

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 3:47pm EDT
hm

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 3:47pm EDT
they are light though but i'll fix it when i'm home

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 4:02pm EDT
funfun

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 4:02pm EDT
I have so much I should be doing

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 4:02pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 4:22pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 4:33pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 4:33pm EDT
TOO BAD

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 4:33pm EDT
IT SHALL BE DONE

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 4:43pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 4:43pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 4:50pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 4:50pm EDT
The goal: get as much done in the next 12.5 hours as possible

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 4:51pm EDT
And try to keep each project at less than 5 hours Oh god

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 4:54pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 5:17pm EDT
THAT SUCKS

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 5:17pm EDT
fucking sara

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 5:17pm EDT
and that's really random

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 5:17pm EDT
I don't think sara's allowed at my house while I have a computeron ever again

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 5:17pm EDT
Yeah I know when it's her lol

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 5:18pm EDT
it's a tad obvious

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 5:18pm EDT
I just act like nothing's different

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 5:18pm EDT
it makes her happy

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 5:44pm EDT
THEY NEED TO BE RECTANGLES ;__;

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 5:44pm EDT
I hate measuring

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 5:44pm EDT
D:

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 5:44pm EDT
Omg

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 5:45pm EDT
why?

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 5:45pm EDT
Because the measurements dont work how I have them like I was an idiot and colored in the pencil

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 5:46pm EDT
It works if I have it in rectangles

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 5:46pm EDT
That sucks

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 5:46pm EDT
2in rectangles that are 1in wide

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 5:46pm EDT
And vertically separated by 1/8

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 5:46pm EDT
as long as it's perfect

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 5:48pm EDT
Shit now the space GRRR THE SPACE BETWEEN THE BLOCKS HORIZONTALLY IS 5/16 THIS IS NOT OKAY

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 5:48pm EDT
I can fix this

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 5:49pm EDT
you got this

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 5:58pm EDT
It's impossible to fix I can't have it be 5/16 apart horizontally though I can't

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 5:58pm EDT
Why cant I do math

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 6:00pm EDT
i really couldn't tell you

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 6:00pm EDT
just scribble all over it

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 6:00pm EDT
then say it wasn't perfect so you couldn't finish

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 6:00pm EDT
thus OCD

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 6:00pm EDT
emmy please

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 6:11pm EDT
Luckily No one notices these things But The width of one box is half of a 16th off I know it But no one else will so it's okay Jesus Christ Your idea is a good back up tho in case anything else goes wrong Which I am intoxicating as always

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 6:11pm EDT
intoxicating?

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 6:13pm EDT
Fucker

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 6:13pm EDT
Anticipating

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 6:13pm EDT
How

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 6:14pm EDT
i know, I'm just a dick

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 6:15pm EDT
I need to turn everything off and actually do work

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 6:15pm EDT
talk to you later

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 6:15pm EDT
good luck with the measurements

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 6:16pm EDT
Thank you Good luck with your stuff

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 9:21pm EDT
Should the rectangles have a design inside cause I feel like it doesn't really fit with the others If I just do it plain colors

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
the design should be there

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
hmm

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
not too intricate

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
but they should be in order somehow

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
like the colours should be in spectrum order

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
Well every 7th rectangle needs to be violet

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
There's only so many ways to count 7 as well

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
?

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
Like. Two.

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
what do you mean?

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
For that rectangle the purple pencil is under to be purple

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT
oh

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT
The hand is covered in multiples of 7

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT
For a reason

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT
I wan't saying it has to be the color thing

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT
I was just giving an example

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 9:37pm EDT
Well what do you mean then ._.

Nick Devlin May 6, 2012 at 9:37pm EDT
I have no clue ignore that

Steph Dudak May 6, 2012 at 9:40pm EDT
Okay x.x

Nick Devlin May 8, 2012 at 5:13pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 11, 2012 at 11:00pm EDT
YES

Steph Dudak May 11, 2012 at 11:00pm EDT
and you can only sing those couple words over and over cause you don't know the rest so it stays longer

Nick Devlin May 11, 2012 at 11:01pm EDT
the only solution id to listen to the song on repeat for a week

Nick Devlin May 11, 2012 at 11:01pm EDT
otherwise the condition can last months

Nick Devlin May 11, 2012 at 11:02pm EDT

Cause it's not her like main element

Steph Dudak May 12, 2012 at 11:34am EDT
Still weakest one

Steph Dudak May 12, 2012 at 11:34am EDT
Aang mostly air bended

Nick Devlin May 12, 2012 at 11:35am EDT
yeah I suppose

Steph Dudak May 12, 2012 at 11:35am EDT
Korra doesn't earth bend all that much either It's funny She water and fire bends a lot

Steph Dudak May 12, 2012 at 11:35am EDT
And they're opposites

Nick Devlin May 12, 2012 at 11:35am EDT
which are supposed to be opposites

Nick Devlin May 12, 2012 at 11:35am EDT
mhmm

Nick Devlin May 12, 2012 at 11:36am EDT
i think she's just a water bender that really really wants to be a fire bender

Nick Devlin May 12, 2012 at 11:36am EDT
and happened to get lucky

Nick Devlin May 12, 2012 at 11:36am EDT
and become the avatar

Steph Dudak May 12, 2012 at 11:37am EDT
I just don't think she likes air bending cause it frustrates her

Steph Dudak May 12, 2012 at 11:37am EDT
She's no twinkle toes

Nick Devlin May 12, 2012 at 11:37am EDT
not at all

Nick Devlin May 12, 2012 at 11:37am EDT
I wonder what her interaction with aang will be like when she does that meditate-y thing and talks to him

Steph Dudak May 12, 2012 at 11:37am EDT
I can't wait til that happens

Steph Dudak May 12, 2012 at 11:38am EDT
I wonder if she'll have any interaction with any other cool spirit world stuff Like how Aang did with Koh and the owl guy from the library I forget his name

Nick Devlin May 12, 2012 at 11:38am EDT
i just imagine aang being all add and excited about meeting korra

Nick Devlin May 12, 2012 at 11:38am EDT
when korra is calling for help during an emergency

Nick Devlin May 12, 2012 at 11:38am EDT
and her just face plaming

Steph Dudak May 12, 2012 at 11:40am EDT
Haha imagine Aang I need your help Yeah yeah one second. WANNA GO PENGUIN SLEDDING WITH ME!? :D .... Uh

Nick Devlin May 12, 2012 at 11:40am EDT
that's exactly what'd happen

Nick Devlin May 12, 2012 at 11:44am EDT
I imagine him just asking a million questions

Nick Devlin May 12, 2012 at 11:44am EDT
"Hi! Is it fun being avatar? I loved it"

Nick Devlin May 12, 2012 at 11:44am EDT

Nick Devlin May 12, 2012 at 11:45am EDT

Nick Devlin May 12, 2012 at 11:45am EDT
isnt it fun

Nick Devlin May 12, 2012 at 11:45am EDT
Korra: I'm supposed to ask YOU questions!!

Steph Dudak May 12, 2012 at 11:45am EDT
Haha that'd be funny

Steph Dudak May 12, 2012 at 12:26pm EDT
you know what i realized

Steph Dudak May 12, 2012 at 12:26pm EDT
Earth bending >> metal bending Fire bending >> lightning bending Water bending >> blood bending and then there's air bending

Nick Devlin May 12, 2012 at 12:29pm EDT
hmm

Nick Devlin May 12, 2012 at 12:29pm EDT

and i have authors for world lit

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 6:44pm EDT
What exactly is your work for world lit? I need to do my dumb budget project and "bag of me" project for health. Gonna kill myself. I'm currently workin on my pre calc take home test. 4/8 so far, I'd have definitely failed this if I'd taken it in class

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 6:44pm EDT
that sucks

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 6:44pm EDT
i will give you what she gave us

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 6:45pm EDT
2 countries literary trends pictures authors classic lit historical context

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 6:45pm EDT
whatever the hell this mean

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 6:46pm EDT
but I'm doing it

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 6:46pm EDT
Is it like a report? Like a paper that you need to write?

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 6:46pm EDT
it's on a posterboard

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 6:46pm EDT
I'm assuming it needs little to no work

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 6:47pm EDT
Seems basically like lists of shit no one cares about

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 6:47pm EDT
Some bullets may be required it seems

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 6:48pm EDT
I'm not doing that

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 6:48pm EDT
I'm gonna have pictues

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 6:48pm EDT
of authors

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 6:48pm EDT
then a book or something they wrote

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 6:48pm EDT
maybe a paragraph on each

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 6:48pm EDT
that's it

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 6:49pm EDT
I have other things to do

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 6:49pm EDT
and I'm getting a B no matter what

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 6:49pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 8:08pm EDT
This is one of the worst math tests I've ever taken

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 8:08pm EDT
is it about identities?

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 8:10pm EDT
Yessir

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 8:10pm EDT
thought so

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 8:10pm EDT
I heard they suck

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 8:10pm EDT
I've been doing fine on homework and everything

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 8:10pm EDT
But this test

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 8:10pm EDT
This is what I've been trying to do

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 8:10pm EDT
For the last Really long time

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 8:11pm EDT
haha funny

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 8:12pm EDT
I was teaching geometry

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 8:12pm EDT
then all the sudden I saw sin and cos

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 8:12pm EDT
and just went

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 8:12pm EDT
...wtf are those?

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 8:12pm EDT
then told the class that they already learned that stuff so just do it on your own

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 8:12pm EDT
Hahahaha

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 8:12pm EDT
Good teacher

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 8:13pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 8:13pm EDT
freakin SohCahToa

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 8:13pm EDT
always was horrible at trig

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 8:14pm EDT
Poor Nicholas

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 8:14pm EDT
I feel like all I've been doing this year is trig

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 8:14pm EDT
are you solving for x in that equation?

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 8:14pm EDT
No

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 8:15pm EDT
You need to make one side equal the other

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 8:15pm EDT
So the sin cubed blahblah needs to eventually be simplified to what's on the right

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 8:15pm EDT
Or Vice Versa

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 8:15pm EDT
I won't waste your time trying to get you to teach me your test

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 8:15pm EDT
x is just representative of the angle. It could be theta or y or anything really

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 8:16pm EDT
because I have only the slightest idea of what you mean

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 8:16pm EDT
Yeah unfortunately None of my friends are capable of helpin me

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 8:16pm EDT
I miss being math smart :'(

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 8:16pm EDT
I talk about my stupid decision of not droppingTV21 for precalc

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 8:16pm EDT
in my Spanish essay

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 8:17pm EDT
Poor Nicholas lol Spanish

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 8:18pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 9:14pm EDT
I don't like being rushed

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 9:15pm EDT
i know

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 9:15pm EDT
it's awful right

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 9:15pm EDT
that's why all my projects are like 467945 years late

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 9:15pm EDT
this is barely a serious project

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 9:15pm EDT
and I keep having to use stupid ideas

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 9:15pm EDT
becauseI dont have time to think of good ones

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 9:16pm EDT
whats the project on

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 9:24pm EDT
I am drawing the 4 seasons

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 9:24pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 9:24pm EDT
each season is a different meduim

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 9:24pm EDT
I have summer

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 9:25pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 9:25pm EDT
winter will be a spade snowflake

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 9:25pm EDT
possibly graphite

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 9:25pm EDT
spring will be flowers with paint I think

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 9:25pm EDT
I really chose a horrible idea for this project

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 9:26pm EDT
I am not good at drawing any of these things

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 9:26pm EDT
yet I picked them for something "I would use in a portfolio"

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 9:26pm EDT
This piece is awful

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT
btw my sister has your sisters science book. she wanted me to tell you that

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 10:56pm EDT
whichever you want really

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 10:56pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 11:43pm EDT
Problem solved

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 11:44pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 11:45pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 11:46pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 11:46pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 11:47pm EDT
if you want a live one

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 11:47pm EDT
then no

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 11:47pm EDT
I was being facetious

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 11:48pm EDT
That was just my first reaction idk Well I wasn't under the assumption that you carry hundreds of live dragons Although I was referring to a real dragon when I said I wish I had one

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 11:49pm EDT
I always am

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 11:49pm EDT
depends what kind

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 11:49pm EDT
I would love one of the dragons from the Fire within series

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 11:50pm EDT
They are little ceramic dragons that come alive when no one is around but the people that live in the home

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 11:50pm EDT
And they all have little talents

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 11:50pm EDT
depending on what they are

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 11:51pm EDT
Like there are fixing dragons and healing dragons, etc

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 11:51pm EDT
there are even art and writing dragons

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 11:51pm EDT
and they hold little hammers or paint brushes or bandaids

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 11:51pm EDT
that'd be sweet

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 11:51pm EDT
O:

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 11:51pm EDT
That's awesome

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 11:51pm EDT
I know!

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 11:52pm EDT
Oh

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 11:53pm EDT
What's my favorite book

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 11:53pm EDT
umm

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 11:53pm EDT
you've probly told me before

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 11:53pm EDT
I'm guessing it's not harry potter

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 11:53pm EDT
No like I don't know what my favorite book is

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 11:54pm EDT
This isn't a test It's just cause then that'd be another thing to put in

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 11:54pm EDT
list books you'd read right now if you had the chance

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 11:56pm EDT
Books ive read or havent? Cause i mean Uh the books you and Kevin gave me The list of John green books I've never gotten to. Btw I'm reading looking for Alaska for my independent study Um What's it called Demon King? Some shit like that. By cinda Williams china. There's part of it at the end of the dragon heir I believe Others Maybe I'll put the wizard heir in there

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 11:56pm EDT
books you have read

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 11:56pm EDT
You should've said that

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 11:56pm EDT
thats a fun study

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 11:56pm EDT
i wanted to see the list

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 11:57pm EDT
If I were to read any book right now it wouldn't be one I've read cause there's too many I want to read

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 11:57pm EDT
well my theory is, if you'd read the book again, it must be a good book

Steph Dudak May 17, 2012 at 11:58pm EDT
I think I read the wizard heir twice anyway since I accidentally started with that one. I like that trilogy so I might as well throw it in there. Besides its not like I need to talk about the book

Nick Devlin May 17, 2012 at 11:59pm EDT
they should be in there on their covers alone

Steph Dudak May 18, 2012 at 12:00am EDT
That's why I picked the book up lol

Nick Devlin May 18, 2012 at 12:00am EDT
what's this for?

Steph Dudak May 18, 2012 at 12:00am EDT
That book proved that I can sometimes judge a book by its cover and get away with it

Steph Dudak May 18, 2012 at 12:00am EDT
My bag of me project

Nick Devlin May 18, 2012 at 12:00am EDT
I always base books based on their covers

Nick Devlin May 18, 2012 at 12:00am EDT

Steph Dudak May 18, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
Leo: They'd make a whole sport of it- they'd find a bunch of really sadistic, fucked up people on the black market and put you in a pit filled with big cats (especially lions), you'd hear "let the games begin!" and a spotlight would come on the death pit as your torn to shreds. hahaha

Nick Devlin May 18, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 18, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 18, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 18, 2012 at 9:40pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 21, 2012 at 6:45pm EDT
after i graduate college

Steph Dudak May 21, 2012 at 6:45pm EDT
i will never find a job

Steph Dudak May 21, 2012 at 6:45pm EDT
the fact that i need to find a job for this project that i can get right after i graduate that is relevant to what i majored in right now and i have no idea what i'm doing dumbest project

Steph Dudak May 21, 2012 at 6:46pm EDT
http://architect.thingamajob.com/jobs/Utah/Architectural-Designer/2560193 found this thing though and i'm using it

Nick Devlin May 21, 2012 at 7:36pm EDT
yeah I always see architecture and graphic design at the top 10 of "harderest fields to get a job in"

Steph Dudak May 21, 2012 at 7:37pm EDT
top 10 "do not get a job in this field" "you suck stop trying to get a job in architecture" "why would you major in this" "it is not at all lucrative" etc

Nick Devlin May 21, 2012 at 7:37pm EDT
yes

Steph Dudak May 21, 2012 at 7:37pm EDT
"everything lies to you"

Nick Devlin May 21, 2012 at 7:37pm EDT
That's why I quit my major

Nick Devlin May 21, 2012 at 7:37pm EDT
if i can't go to drexel

Nick Devlin May 21, 2012 at 7:37pm EDT
i can't get a job

Nick Devlin May 21, 2012 at 7:37pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 21, 2012 at 7:37pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 21, 2012 at 7:38pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 21, 2012 at 7:38pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 21, 2012 at 7:38pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 21, 2012 at 7:38pm EDT
or what that stuff is

Nick Devlin May 21, 2012 at 7:38pm EDT
I'll end up juggling at renaissance fairs or something

Nick Devlin May 21, 2012 at 7:39pm EDT
so i'm set

Nick Devlin May 21, 2012 at 7:39pm EDT
i have no clue where the in between stuff is

Nick Devlin May 21, 2012 at 7:39pm EDT
maybe if you worked for a firm

Steph Dudak May 21, 2012 at 7:40pm EDT
i meant other stuff if i felt like architecture is failing/not for me

Steph Dudak May 21, 2012 at 7:40pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 21, 2012 at 7:42pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 21, 2012 at 7:43pm EDT
the first year or so is just the irrelevant to your major classes anyway

Nick Devlin May 21, 2012 at 7:43pm EDT
so it won't be too bad if you need to switch

Nick Devlin May 21, 2012 at 7:44pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 21, 2012 at 7:58pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 21, 2012 at 7:58pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 21, 2012 at 7:58pm EDT
and you accidentally bended them without knowing

Steph Dudak May 21, 2012 at 7:58pm EDT
that'd be awful

Nick Devlin May 21, 2012 at 7:58pm EDT
that's horrifying

Nick Devlin May 21, 2012 at 7:59pm EDT
i wonder how you you would bend earth in someone?

Nick Devlin May 21, 2012 at 7:59pm EDT
people breathe air

Nick Devlin May 21, 2012 at 7:59pm EDT
are like 80% water

Nick Devlin May 21, 2012 at 7:59pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 21, 2012 at 7:59pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 21, 2012 at 8:01pm EDT
blood bending you know

Steph Dudak May 21, 2012 at 8:02pm EDT
no earth or metal bending would work in a person i don't think unless they had actual metal chunks in them somewhere

Nick Devlin May 21, 2012 at 8:20pm EDT
i think my facebook app broke

Nick Devlin May 21, 2012 at 8:20pm EDT
here's what i wrote before

Nick Devlin May 21, 2012 at 8:20pm EDT
I got it bend earth and cover the person in an earth exoskeleton then bend that erth I still don't get why earth benders never use their full power they literally just hand to make cages of earth around people, or bury them to their waist

Steph Dudak May 21, 2012 at 8:21pm EDT
cause that

Steph Dudak May 21, 2012 at 8:21pm EDT

Nick is known for his magnificent fame throughout the nation. He also has the power to rocket instantly, however only in winter. Nick has mastered the ability to change shape into a werewolf, but he must speak words of power to do so. Additionally, he has learned to sculpt and mold all corbomite with a thought and he has the power to cause his antagonists to become diseased. Nick has been known to transform any dog into fluid, but never during a new moon. He can create mental energy out of thin air. Terribly, Nick is notorious for being horribly disfigured. Nick is notorious for being horribly disfigured

Nick Devlin May 28, 2012 at 9:48pm EDT
i understand

Nick Devlin May 28, 2012 at 9:49pm EDT
I have been avoiding that wing to make sure i dont see it before any of the ap ones are done

Nick Devlin May 28, 2012 at 9:49pm EDT
and to see if I can guess who made what

Nick Devlin May 28, 2012 at 9:50pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 28, 2012 at 9:50pm EDT
All the other ap ones are done I think

Steph Dudak May 28, 2012 at 9:50pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 28, 2012 at 9:51pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 28, 2012 at 9:51pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 28, 2012 at 9:51pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 28, 2012 at 10:08pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 28, 2012 at 10:08pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 28, 2012 at 10:08pm EDT
but i highly doubt he'd even know what Ditto was if I asked him

Nick Devlin May 28, 2012 at 10:09pm EDT
or if i showed him a pic

Nick Devlin May 28, 2012 at 10:09pm EDT
oh well

Nick Devlin May 28, 2012 at 10:09pm EDT
more pipe dreams

Steph Dudak May 28, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
what's my greatest weakness

Steph Dudak May 28, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
and strength

Steph Dudak May 28, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
sorry to change the subject

Nick Devlin May 28, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
hmmm

Nick Devlin May 28, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
weakness, maybe your temper

Nick Devlin May 28, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
that's be my bet

Steph Dudak May 28, 2012 at 10:11pm EDT
you'd win that bet

Nick Devlin May 28, 2012 at 10:11pm EDT
especially your temper around josh or doug

Nick Devlin May 28, 2012 at 10:11pm EDT
then strength would be either dedication to work, or loyalty to a project etc.

Nick Devlin May 28, 2012 at 10:12pm EDT
but meh, you tend to overdo that, if it's not perfect you throw it away

Steph Dudak May 28, 2012 at 10:12pm EDT
weakness and strength: attention to detail

Steph Dudak May 28, 2012 at 10:12pm EDT
WOMP

Nick Devlin May 28, 2012 at 10:12pm EDT
very much so

Nick Devlin May 28, 2012 at 10:13pm EDT
yeah

Steph Dudak May 28, 2012 at 10:14pm EDT
meh

Nick Devlin May 28, 2012 at 10:15pm EDT
greatest strengths are hard to think of

Steph Dudak May 28, 2012 at 10:15pm EDT
especially when most of the strengths i think of double as weaknesses lol

Nick Devlin May 28, 2012 at 10:15pm EDT
all of my strengths are weaknesses

Nick Devlin May 28, 2012 at 10:18pm EDT
and hmm, I really can't think of standout strengths in you

Steph Dudak May 28, 2012 at 10:19pm EDT
wallwalalalwalala okie

Nick Devlin May 28, 2012 at 10:20pm EDT
stuff like your smart at math, you work hard, you stand up for yourself. It's all just good things

Nick Devlin May 28, 2012 at 10:20pm EDT
no real greatest strength

Steph Dudak May 28, 2012 at 10:21pm EDT
i don't need to answer the question completely seriously, it's just a tumblr ask lol but i need to answer all the dumb even numbers

Nick Devlin May 28, 2012 at 10:22pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 28, 2012 at 10:24pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 3, 2012 at 10:25pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 7, 2012 at 3:52pm EDT
a server is just a map where you play in multiplayer

Nick Devlin June 7, 2012 at 3:52pm EDT
it's kind of like a chatroom

Nick Devlin June 7, 2012 at 3:53pm EDT
oh better example

Nick Devlin June 7, 2012 at 3:53pm EDT
a forum

Steph Dudak June 7, 2012 at 3:53pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 7, 2012 at 4:08pm EDT

nordic

Nick Devlin June 7, 2012 at 4:09pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 7, 2012 at 4:09pm EDT

Steph Dudak June 12, 2012 at 10:13pm EDT
One can hope

Steph Dudak June 12, 2012 at 10:14pm EDT
Really graduating at north is just not on the list of things I wanna do

Steph Dudak June 12, 2012 at 10:14pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 12, 2012 at 10:15pm EDT

Steph Dudak June 12, 2012 at 10:16pm EDT
Because the blue is ugly

Steph Dudak June 12, 2012 at 10:16pm EDT
Should be black and silver

Nick Devlin June 12, 2012 at 10:16pm EDT
the powder blue

Nick Devlin June 12, 2012 at 10:16pm EDT
black and silver would be badass

Nick Devlin June 12, 2012 at 10:16pm EDT

Steph Dudak June 12, 2012 at 10:16pm EDT
It's definitely not

Steph Dudak June 12, 2012 at 10:16pm EDT
But I wish it were

Steph Dudak June 12, 2012 at 10:16pm EDT
Cause those are our main school colors

Steph Dudak June 12, 2012 at 10:17pm EDT
And it'd look so much better

Steph Dudak June 12, 2012 at 10:17pm EDT
Especially since they went for that whole checkerboard thing

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 3:30pm EDT
by some 16 year old kid with a typewriter

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 3:31pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 3:31pm EDT
the internet

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 3:31pm EDT
http://www.rdrop.com/~hutch/argon

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 3:32pm EDT
"The enthused barbarian swilveled about, his shock of fiery red hair tossing robustly in the humid air currents as he faced the attack of the defeated soldier's fellow in arms."

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 3:32pm EDT
I just got to like the 3rd sentence

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 3:33pm EDT
i can't even read this lol

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
It makes almost no sense

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
It's just a bunch of incorretly used vocab words

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 3:35pm EDT
too much too much aaah

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 3:47pm EDT
yeah I'll be reading this out loud first as practice

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 4:03pm EDT
Hahaha excellent

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 4:52pm EDT
i know nothing about computers

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 4:52pm EDT
that's somethin to teach yourself this summer

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 4:52pm EDT
or just learn yk

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 4:53pm EDT
I am right now

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 4:53pm EDT
this shit is insane

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 4:53pm EDT
I don't even know who my internet service provider is

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 4:54pm EDT
Verizon maybe?

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 4:54pm EDT
do you have verizon

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 4:54pm EDT
comcast ova here

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 4:55pm EDT
i haven't playeed wow in a while. and i got new shoulders from LFR. the old shoulders i had, plus the chestpiece granted a bonus of judgement granting 1 holy power. now i just changed the shoulders which means i dont have that bonus and dps will be less because it's less fast templar's verdicts need pants nao aaaagh needed someone to complain to

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 4:55pm EDT
about that

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 4:55pm EDT
anywho

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 4:56pm EDT
That's annoying

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 4:56pm EDT
how much work will it be to get the better armour back/

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 4:56pm EDT
well the thing is

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 4:57pm EDT
like okay these shoulders are better stat wise . that's why i'm switching. i'm currently wearing last tiers legs. they're 378. LFR is 384, and regular raids is like 391 or something like that but my guild sucks and never raids and i haven't had time to even tdo that. BUT ANYWAY. i need to win the token to get the legs, and that all depends on who's in my LFR group

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 4:57pm EDT
because the token i need to get is shared by paladins, priests, and i think warlocks

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 4:58pm EDT
so the less of those are in the group, the better chance i have of gettin em, i've been trying to get em for too long

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 4:59pm EDT
why haven't you joined a better guild

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 5:00pm EDT
because i have an attachment to this one

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 5:00pm EDT
i've been in this guild since i started playing and know a lot of the people fairly well and it'd just be weird to me I'm also an officer here and i haven't been on a lot in the last few months

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 5:00pm EDT
i have a feeling some others haven't been either though

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 5:07pm EDT
i understand

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 5:07pm EDT
my minecraft server was like that

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 5:40pm EDT
Sandeep is my new bestfriend

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 5:41pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 5:49pm EDT
I know right!

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 5:50pm EDT

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 5:51pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 5:53pm EDT
I need to find the MAC address for Minecraft

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 6:09pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 6:09pm EDT

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 6:10pm EDT

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:13pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:13pm EDT
I will listen in the second that you tell me

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:18pm EDT
sigh

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:18pm EDT
so i kind of don't like chris nearly as much as he likes me

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:18pm EDT
and i'm kind of meh about this whole relationship thing we got goin on

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:19pm EDT
that's unfun

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:19pm EDT
it is

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:19pm EDT
you got any plans about what to do?

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:19pm EDT
i kind of want to break up with him. buuut i need to figure out how to do it without ruining a lot of things

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:20pm EDT
maybe if all our friends weren't involved in our relationship it wouldn't be half as bad

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:20pm EDT
and maybe if it werent laurie's biggest life accomplishment

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:20pm EDT
idk if i'm being like

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:20pm EDT
weird or if i really just don't like him

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:20pm EDT
like that

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:20pm EDT
hmm, well what have you two done together, like have you gone on any dates?

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:21pm EDT
yeah we've been out quite a few times together and they were fine

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:21pm EDT
but like

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:21pm EDT
i can't look at him in the eyes a lot of the times which is bad

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:21pm EDT
like prom

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:22pm EDT
aww

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:22pm EDT
that's cute and sad

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:22pm EDT
i stared at alayna until she left me pretty much..

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:23pm EDT
i felt chris shake before he kissed me.. and i've prevented him from kissing me before

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:23pm EDT
it sounds like you just don't wanna be in a relationship

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:24pm EDT
i just don't want to be in a relationship with him

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:24pm EDT
he's a great guy and he's super nice and whatever But i just don't think we fit well together yaknow. like

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:24pm EDT
I understand

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:24pm EDT
i shouldnt have a problem kissing my boyfriend ??

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:24pm EDT
I don't think that should be a problem

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:25pm EDT
although sara does tend to hiss when i kiss her sometimes...

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:25pm EDT
thhat's weird

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:25pm EDT
but whatever

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:25pm EDT
XD

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:26pm EDT
yeah I'd say stop now if you really don't think it's gonna work out

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:26pm EDT
that's kinda funny But yeah it's just weird. i can point out things that bother me and i'm not that comfortable around him i guess. and i don't wanna wait too long because i don't wanna make it worse

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:26pm EDT
it makes it less awkward later

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:26pm EDT
exactly

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:27pm EDT
I hope you are able to go back to being friends

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:27pm EDT
if you can everything works out

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:27pm EDT
me too /:

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:28pm EDT
How into the relationship is he?

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:28pm EDT
because if it's too much there's little hope

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:28pm EDT
did you read that truth

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:28pm EDT
i'm not confident we'll be okay after

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:29pm EDT
you will be less friends than before I'd say

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:29pm EDT
but I think the friendship is still salvageable

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:30pm EDT
it'd be less painful

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:30pm EDT
if other people weren't so involved

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:30pm EDT
and if

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:30pm EDT
his mother didn't already basically love me despite not having formally formally metme

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:30pm EDT
i've met her before

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:31pm EDT
i wouldn't worry so much about parents

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:31pm EDT
and she asks how i am and stuff if i'm on skype with him I know but

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:31pm EDT
that makes me feel awkawrd

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:31pm EDT
awkward

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:31pm EDT
she's really nice to me

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:31pm EDT
yeah, it's going to be weird no matter when you break up

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:31pm EDT
it just gets worse every day though

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:31pm EDT
also do it in person

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:32pm EDT
and explain everything

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:32pm EDT
every single detail of why

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:32pm EDT
yeah

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:32pm EDT
i know

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:32pm EDT
i planned to do it in person

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:33pm EDT
what else is there... hmm I wish I had liked quigley mor eso I knew what would have been something I wish she had done when she broke up with me

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:34pm EDT
I was kind of waiting for it so I didn't care much

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:34pm EDT
idk steph

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:34pm EDT
good luck is all i know

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:34pm EDT
i talked to alayna about this about a hundred times

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:35pm EDT
i just need to find out when i can see him in person, and where, so that when it happens and if it ends up badly we can both just leave that's the problem with him living in silverton

Nick Devlin June 14, 2012 at 8:36pm EDT
yeah and lauries party would be horrible

Steph Dudak June 14, 2012 at 8:36pm EDT
that'd be a terrible idea to do it then or that day or right before that day i can't even before then anyway

Nick Devlin June 19, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 19, 2012 at 11:22pm EDT

Steph Dudak June 19, 2012 at 11:23pm EDT

Steph Dudak June 19, 2012 at 11:23pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 22, 2012 at 6:49pm EDT
I found the best thing

Nick Devlin June 22, 2012 at 6:49pm EDT
I was cleaning my room

Nick Devlin June 22, 2012 at 6:50pm EDT
here ya go

Nick Devlin June 22, 2012 at 6:50pm EDT
Here is your story That you HAVE to read IN A SCOTTISH ACCENT! Have fun with that yo. cause this story (if you can call it that) is waak and makes no sense. YAY FOR NONSENSE! NOW OPEN. Hello. My name is George. Im half giraffe, and hald raccoon. Crazy right? Well thats not necessarily true Im also partly human. Wack. I was born in 8732 in a small town in Zimbabwe. I dont remember the name of that town, but I hated it there. Boy did I hate it. Everyone there was mean and judgemental and I wasnt accepted as the giraccman I am. As you may have guessed, I moved away. Now where do I live? I dont live anywhere in particular. Why, may you ask? Simply because now Im a part of a travelling circus. Come see the great fascinating Giraccman! Yeah I guess this isnt too great either. But these other circus freaks accept me, cause theyre pretty different themselves. At least Im cooler than that bearded lady over there Shes probably the tenth one Ive met. Way to be original. Anyone can grow a beard. But me? No. I just own all these weirdos. And one day, I will be supreme ruler of the world!

Nick Devlin June 22, 2012 at 6:50pm EDT
yeah

Nick Devlin June 22, 2012 at 6:50pm EDT
you're a freak

Nick Devlin June 22, 2012 at 6:50pm EDT
nah, this was awesome

Steph Dudak June 22, 2012 at 6:52pm EDT
Hahahahahahaha

Steph Dudak June 22, 2012 at 6:52pm EDT
I REMEMBER THAT

Nick Devlin June 22, 2012 at 7:18pm EDT
ME TOPO

Nick Devlin June 22, 2012 at 7:18pm EDT
TOO

Steph Dudak June 22, 2012 at 7:30pm EDT
That was the best Too bad I didn't write a better story For some reason that was like the first thing that came to mind...

Nick Devlin June 22, 2012 at 7:30pm EDT
yeah I have no clue

Nick Devlin June 22, 2012 at 9:40pm EDT
What are the chances that I could invite dachelle to a charity juggling event an hour away on Sunday?

Nick Devlin June 22, 2012 at 9:41pm EDT
Because I'm gonna try.

Steph Dudak June 22, 2012 at 9:41pm EDT
Why would you ask me that question

Steph Dudak June 22, 2012 at 9:41pm EDT
I'm not even friends with her

Nick Devlin June 22, 2012 at 9:43pm EDT
Just to have someone who knows how ridiculous my life is.

Steph Dudak June 22, 2012 at 9:44pm EDT
As if I didn't already know I wish you good luck though

Steph Dudak June 22, 2012 at 9:45pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 26, 2012 at 10:24pm EDT
of course

Steph Dudak June 26, 2012 at 10:26pm EDT
you may need to work on it a litttttle bit but hahaha that was entertaining to listen to

Steph Dudak June 26, 2012 at 10:26pm EDT
the first one barely sounds like you

Steph Dudak June 26, 2012 at 10:26pm EDT
hahahahaha

Steph Dudak June 26, 2012 at 10:26pm EDT
cause he's a major fucking hottie

Steph Dudak June 26, 2012 at 10:26pm EDT
i'm listening to the 2nd test

Nick Devlin June 26, 2012 at 10:26pm EDT
alright

Nick Devlin June 26, 2012 at 10:26pm EDT
I think that one is completely different

Steph Dudak June 26, 2012 at 10:27pm EDT
it is

Steph Dudak June 26, 2012 at 10:27pm EDT
hahaha

Nick Devlin June 26, 2012 at 10:27pm EDT
i couldn't decide. Big announcer voice, then use retarded girl voice for dialogue. Or just be constantly in retarded girl voice because she is narrorating

Steph Dudak June 26, 2012 at 10:28pm EDT
i think you should do whatever you're more comfortable doing and what's easier for you to do

Nick Devlin June 26, 2012 at 10:28pm EDT
but i'm mainly concerned with which is more amusing

Nick Devlin June 26, 2012 at 10:29pm EDT
since i'm fine with either

Steph Dudak June 26, 2012 at 10:29pm EDT
they're equally amusing lol just because the 2nd one sounds like you, and hearing you say major fucking hottie in a voice that's really similar to yours

Steph Dudak June 26, 2012 at 10:29pm EDT
is hilarious to me

Steph Dudak June 26, 2012 at 10:29pm EDT
cause you obviously don't say things like that hahahaha

Nick Devlin June 26, 2012 at 10:29pm EDT
yeah -.-

Nick Devlin June 26, 2012 at 10:30pm EDT
hmm

Nick Devlin June 26, 2012 at 10:31pm EDT
The thing is, narrator voice #2 is more consistent, but #4 is easier to distinguish dialogue, plus the contrast is amusing

Nick Devlin June 26, 2012 at 10:31pm EDT
and only people who know me will see this so #2 might be funnier

Steph Dudak June 26, 2012 at 10:32pm EDT
send it to another person for a second opinion lol

Nick Devlin June 26, 2012 at 10:32pm EDT
who?

Steph Dudak June 26, 2012 at 10:32pm EDT
difficult to decide

Steph Dudak June 26, 2012 at 10:32pm EDT
julie? kerry? laurie?

Nick Devlin June 26, 2012 at 10:32pm EDT
I think this will be kerry's present so that wouldn't work.

Nick Devlin June 26, 2012 at 10:33pm EDT
I'll read like the first 5 chapters for her or something then add silly video

Steph Dudak June 26, 2012 at 10:33pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 26, 2012 at 10:33pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 26, 2012 at 10:36pm EDT
Time to bother her

Steph Dudak July 5, 2012 at 5:26pm EDT
The unit circle Which isn't hard

Steph Dudak July 5, 2012 at 5:26pm EDT
Trig identities

Steph Dudak July 5, 2012 at 5:27pm EDT
All that stuff Not hard I can send you copies of my pre calc notes if you want :P

Nick Devlin July 5, 2012 at 5:27pm EDT
seriously? I got every trig question wrong I'm pretty sure -.-

Nick Devlin July 5, 2012 at 5:27pm EDT
and that would be wonderful

Steph Dudak July 5, 2012 at 5:27pm EDT
I'll really do that if you want. I'm keeping that notebook forever

Nick Devlin July 5, 2012 at 5:28pm EDT

As much as I can anyway Yeah 14th next Saturday

Nick Devlin July 5, 2012 at 5:30pm EDT
i mostly just need trig stuff, but anything you think wasn't covered much in algebra 2 at all would be good as well

Nick Devlin July 5, 2012 at 5:30pm EDT
I think it's hilarious that I have no clue how to divide with polynomials but I was still able to get one of the answers

Steph Dudak July 5, 2012 at 5:31pm EDT
Most of my notes are stuff we didn't really do in algebra 2 lol I'll probably end up copying like all of them and you can decide what you need to know But You remember imaginary numbers? Quadratic formula? -b/2a? Synthetic division?

Steph Dudak July 5, 2012 at 5:32pm EDT
Linear equations

Steph Dudak July 5, 2012 at 5:32pm EDT
Midpt and distance formulas

Nick Devlin July 5, 2012 at 5:32pm EDT
I remember imaginary numbers, I remember quadratic, and I can google the formulas

Nick Devlin July 5, 2012 at 5:32pm EDT
synthetic division

Nick Devlin July 5, 2012 at 5:33pm EDT
i do not remember

Steph Dudak July 5, 2012 at 5:34pm EDT
Like I said I'll copy most I also have my review for the final if you'd like to keep that lol

Nick Devlin July 5, 2012 at 5:42pm EDT

I took inspiration from your motif of giving cards not presents

Steph Dudak July 20, 2012 at 12:12pm EDT
Idk what's going on on the left but that's cute

Steph Dudak July 20, 2012 at 12:12pm EDT
Cards are always fun

Nick Devlin July 20, 2012 at 12:21pm EDT
the front in in reverse because it's a card and needs to be folded over. The marker bled through

Nick Devlin July 21, 2012 at 12:51am EDT
this

Steph Dudak July 21, 2012 at 12:54am EDT
Oh yaknow Usual lol went over Rich's, played video games, then Rich decided to be a decent human being and drop Josh's shoes off. And rich and I were planning to go to Applebee's and then see dark knight rises and since we were at Josh's house and he wasn't doing anything he tagged along with us

Steph Dudak July 21, 2012 at 12:54am EDT
Josh made many inappropriate jokes involving Richard and me. But that's just josh being josh

Nick Devlin July 21, 2012 at 12:54am EDT
what else would he do---

Nick Devlin July 21, 2012 at 12:54am EDT
wowoww wait

Nick Devlin July 21, 2012 at 12:55am EDT
rich a decent human being?

Steph Dudak July 21, 2012 at 12:55am EDT
Lmfao

Nick Devlin July 21, 2012 at 12:55am EDT
I mistrust that entire statement

Steph Dudak July 21, 2012 at 12:55am EDT
Josh says I have him whipped

Nick Devlin July 21, 2012 at 12:55am EDT
no shit

Nick Devlin July 21, 2012 at 12:55am EDT
everyone has rich whipped

Steph Dudak July 21, 2012 at 12:55am EDT
I texted him before we left to make sure he was home

Steph Dudak July 21, 2012 at 12:55am EDT
And he was like

Steph Dudak July 21, 2012 at 12:55am EDT
... Why.

Steph Dudak July 21, 2012 at 12:55am EDT
And I told him and he's like is this a trap?

Nick Devlin July 21, 2012 at 12:55am EDT
your answer?

Steph Dudak July 21, 2012 at 12:56am EDT
And so I sent him a picture of the shoes in the back seat

Steph Dudak July 21, 2012 at 12:56am EDT
And that was right before we walked up to his door

Steph Dudak July 21, 2012 at 12:56am EDT
And he was like wow Cause rich was like Should I drop his shoes off? And I was like yeah. Be a decent human being. Give him his shoes back.

Steph Dudak July 21, 2012 at 12:57am EDT
So that was another thing josh carried on a couple times through the night; rich being whipped. Josh thanked me and was actually nicer than usual today lol

Steph Dudak July 21, 2012 at 12:58am EDT
He didn't accuse me of being a robot for once AND he actually told me I had emotion

Steph Dudak July 21, 2012 at 12:58am EDT
Winning

Nick Devlin July 21, 2012 at 12:58am EDT

Steph Dudak July 24, 2012 at 12:15pm EDT
no emotions

Nick Devlin July 24, 2012 at 3:30pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 24, 2012 at 3:31pm EDT

Steph Dudak July 24, 2012 at 3:52pm EDT
I do that because the joke is getting old and makes no sense but I don't really give a shit enough to make an "I have emotions" argument

Steph Dudak July 24, 2012 at 3:54pm EDT
Plus you find a way to be a dick anyway Resistance is futile

Nick Devlin July 24, 2012 at 5:53pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 24, 2012 at 5:53pm EDT

"Is this some sort of cult?"

Steph Dudak July 25, 2012 at 12:06am EDT

Steph Dudak July 26, 2012 at 2:10pm EDT
buy her a five foot stuffed penguin to beat out the one franco got her for their anniversary or whatever the occasion was

Steph Dudak July 26, 2012 at 2:10pm EDT
force her to bring it to college with her

Steph Dudak July 26, 2012 at 2:10pm EDT
not that that'd be hard

Nick Devlin July 26, 2012 at 2:10pm EDT
force her?

Nick Devlin July 26, 2012 at 2:11pm EDT
yeah i was about to say

Nick Devlin July 26, 2012 at 2:11pm EDT
we'd have to force her to seperate from it

Steph Dudak July 26, 2012 at 2:11pm EDT
more like tell her and she'll just agree that that's a fabulous idea

Nick Devlin July 26, 2012 at 2:11pm EDT
that sounds more likely

Steph Dudak July 26, 2012 at 2:11pm EDT
she'd thank you for suggesting it

Steph Dudak July 26, 2012 at 2:11pm EDT
because most people would be like STOP CARRYING THAT AROUND

Steph Dudak July 26, 2012 at 2:11pm EDT

Steph Dudak July 31, 2012 at 12:50pm EDT
we don't need that

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 12:51pm EDT
of course we need that!

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:00pm EDT
how popular am i

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:00pm EDT
scale of 1- 1000

Steph Dudak July 31, 2012 at 1:00pm EDT
uh

Steph Dudak July 31, 2012 at 1:00pm EDT
501

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:00pm EDT
thanks

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:00pm EDT
ugh i can't decide how to measure popularity

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:01pm EDT
because if it's by 'people that know me'

Steph Dudak July 31, 2012 at 1:01pm EDT
i added 1+1000 and divided by 2

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:01pm EDT
i'd actually be one of the most popular people in school

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:01pm EDT
juggling ftw

Steph Dudak July 31, 2012 at 1:01pm EDT
because idk how to answer that question

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:01pm EDT
yeah neither do i

Steph Dudak July 31, 2012 at 1:01pm EDT
so i figured i'd take the average

Steph Dudak July 31, 2012 at 1:01pm EDT
haha

Steph Dudak July 31, 2012 at 1:02pm EDT
why?

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:02pm EDT
using a formula from a john green novel

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:02pm EDT
just for fun

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:02pm EDT
he made it as a sort of joke

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:02pm EDT
the guy in his book was this child prodigy

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:02pm EDT
who sucked at relationships

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:02pm EDT
they all fell apart

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:03pm EDT
so he tried to create a formula to determine if a relationship would fall apart or not

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:03pm EDT
unfortunately all f the variables ar esubjectivre

Steph Dudak July 31, 2012 at 1:04pm EDT
ahhhh gotcha

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:13pm EDT
yeah

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:13pm EDT
so apparently i would be the one to end the relationship

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:13pm EDT
assuming i can objectively quantify the variable

Steph Dudak July 31, 2012 at 1:13pm EDT
lies

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:13pm EDT
s

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:13pm EDT
yes

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:13pm EDT
it is

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:14pm EDT
neither of us would ever end the relationship, the only thing that could break us up would be external forces like college or housing or something

Steph Dudak July 31, 2012 at 1:15pm EDT
even still

Steph Dudak July 31, 2012 at 1:15pm EDT
college is dumb

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:16pm EDT
very

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:16pm EDT
but it does keep us apart for weeks to months at a time

Steph Dudak July 31, 2012 at 1:16pm EDT
how far away is sara going?

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:16pm EDT
not very

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:16pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:17pm EDT

Steph Dudak July 31, 2012 at 1:17pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:17pm EDT

Steph Dudak July 31, 2012 at 1:18pm EDT
that's pretty much how my life is gonna go all i know is my roommate better be cool with visitors no choice

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:19pm EDT
apparently nina and jose might be a thing

Steph Dudak July 31, 2012 at 1:19pm EDT
whaaaaaaaaaaaat

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:19pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:19pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 31, 2012 at 1:19pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 14, 2012 at 12:41pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 14, 2012 at 12:47pm EDT

Nick Devlin August 14, 2012 at 12:48pm EDT
send a letter to the mailing area

Nick Devlin August 14, 2012 at 12:48pm EDT
or email student services

Nick Devlin August 14, 2012 at 12:48pm EDT
that'd probly be faster

Nick Devlin August 14, 2012 at 12:48pm EDT
or even scarier call them by phone

Nick Devlin August 14, 2012 at 12:48pm EDT
that will be very fast

Steph Dudak August 14, 2012 at 12:51pm EDT

We did like this other thing with lines and shit

Nick Devlin August 25, 2012 at 11:27pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:27pm EDT

So then guess what the hw was Yeah Draw two still life's and write a paragraph about yourself

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:28pm EDT
Whatever The next class we practiced drawing straight lines on 18x24 paper with charcoal and we did more still life stuff. This one

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:29pm EDT
This one okay we were like not allowed to pick up the pencil and it was to like get the feeeeel of what we were drawing and don't look at the paper

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:29pm EDT
Just let your hand draw

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:29pm EDT
Fine whatever

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:29pm EDT
And he was getting like agitated at some people She even pointed out something to me when I wasn't even fucking done.

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:29pm EDT
Like it was this broom and it was like bunched up and tied in a million different little things in the bottom

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:31pm EDT
And I just drew like the general broom shape thing whatever idek and THIS BITCH was like you see how each thing is like tied up individually yeah you should show that and I'm like nigga NO FUCKING SHIT IM NOT DONE YET

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:31pm EDT
Whatever.

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:31pm EDT
So then

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:32pm EDT
End of he dreadful three hour class. And she was like So I went through your still life's and they were horrible

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:32pm EDT
She literally said that

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:32pm EDT
They were all horrible except for maybe two or three of you

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:32pm EDT
So I'm gonna give yall a second chance to do this again

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:33pm EDT
And so

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:33pm EDT
I still need to draw two still life's Due Monday I've been putting it off bc I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE ACTUALLY WANTS

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:33pm EDT
An cause I hate still life's and that class

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:34pm EDT
Maybe it'll get better

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:34pm EDT
Idk

Nick Devlin August 25, 2012 at 11:34pm EDT
I'm sorry

Nick Devlin August 25, 2012 at 11:34pm EDT
i hope so too

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:34pm EDT
So what else

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:34pm EDT
Uh

Nick Devlin August 25, 2012 at 11:34pm EDT
still life's are important though

Nick Devlin August 25, 2012 at 11:34pm EDT
if annoing as hell

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:34pm EDT
My math teacher is nothing like dziedzic

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:34pm EDT
It's sad

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:35pm EDT
I'm assuming things will be more challenging for me when I start doing actual calc stuff because we've only just done like algebra review and simple limits

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:35pm EDT
Uhhhhh

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:36pm EDT
My writing teacher is cool. He's from north Carolina and has a slight southern accent sometimes and says y'all a lot and reminds me of Neil Patrick Harris

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:36pm EDT
I like pat too. She's my environmental science teacher.

Nick Devlin August 25, 2012 at 11:36pm EDT
that's good

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:36pm EDT
She seems like she's a good teacher we haven't done that much yet

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:36pm EDT
But shes not boring

Nick Devlin August 25, 2012 at 11:36pm EDT
very important

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:36pm EDT
And makes the class engaging I guess so you know whatever that's fine

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:36pm EDT
Then design

Nick Devlin August 25, 2012 at 11:37pm EDT
so many classes x.x

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:37pm EDT
I don't hate it yet. Betty reminds me of Amy from big bang theory

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:37pm EDT

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:43pm EDT
He doesn't like driving down here It was worth it though

Steph Dudak August 25, 2012 at 11:43pm EDT
He also pointed out to me that PA cars have no front plates

Steph Dudak August 31, 2012 at 12:41pm EDT
Shut up nick Devlin

Steph Dudak August 31, 2012 at 12:42pm EDT
I totally will

Steph Dudak August 31, 2012 at 12:42pm EDT
Idk what that is but it sounds like really bad porn

Nick Devlin August 31, 2012 at 1:01pm EDT
I'm assuming so as well.

Nick Devlin August 31, 2012 at 1:03pm EDT
So what are you up to today? Any idea of how things are gonna work out

Nick Devlin August 31, 2012 at 1:04pm EDT
just so I can try to find a way fo you and sara to see eachother

Steph Dudak August 31, 2012 at 1:05pm EDT
I don't even know. I'm worried about being able to see my family at this point -.-. I have two models and a paper with a plan, section, and elevation drawing due tuesday for my shoe project. and i'm doing those little boots i have, i have to make a model of that out of cardboard and it is the biggest pain in the ass ever. so i gotta do all that at home. i'm most likely not gonna actually be in toms river til like 4 or after 4 probably

Steph Dudak August 31, 2012 at 1:06pm EDT
if mom hasnt left yet shes leaving soon, it'll take her 1.5, probably closer to 2 hours to get here. so figure 3 so i won't actually be around til maybe 5.

Nick Devlin August 31, 2012 at 1:06pm EDT
It's like college is tons of work or something god

Nick Devlin August 31, 2012 at 1:06pm EDT
so annoying

Steph Dudak August 31, 2012 at 1:06pm EDT
i'm sick of it already there are no such things as breaks when you have design

Nick Devlin August 31, 2012 at 1:06pm EDT
i can imagine

Steph Dudak August 31, 2012 at 1:06pm EDT
ill be spending all my time in studio i can bet and it sucks

Steph Dudak August 31, 2012 at 1:07pm EDT
the only good thing is that originally i was gonna have to have all four models due tuesday

Steph Dudak August 31, 2012 at 1:07pm EDT
and she shortened it to just the two instead

Steph Dudak August 31, 2012 at 1:07pm EDT
so i'm thankful for that but i still have a lot of shit to do

Nick Devlin August 31, 2012 at 1:08pm EDT
That sucks, but at least this isn't new to you. You done it before! And everything went awesomely

Steph Dudak August 31, 2012 at 1:08pm EDT
that's the thing it's good that i'm used to it

Steph Dudak August 31, 2012 at 1:08pm EDT
but i don't want a repeat of senior year cause that shit sucked

Steph Dudak August 31, 2012 at 1:08pm EDT
AND

Steph Dudak August 31, 2012 at 1:08pm EDT
math right now

Steph Dudak August 31, 2012 at 1:08pm EDT
holy shit

Steph Dudak August 31, 2012 at 1:09pm EDT
you know what nah, im not gonna rant about this at the moment. ill save it for that video ill eventually have to get around to making

Nick Devlin August 31, 2012 at 1:09pm EDT
YES

Nick Devlin August 31, 2012 at 1:09pm EDT
GOOD CHOICE

Nick Devlin August 31, 2012 at 1:09pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 5:01pm EDT
hopefully you were doing things other than projects though

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 5:43pm EDT
barely

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 6:09pm EDT
sadness

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 7:48pm EDT
yeah I saw rich and he was over today for dinner and stuff and pretty much watched me work. he just left though

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 7:50pm EDT
i should yell at him for no reason

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 7:50pm EDT
haven't done that in a while

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 7:50pm EDT
womp

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 7:51pm EDT
havent heard that in a while

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 7:53pm EDT
Yeeeeeah

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:04pm EDT
so what else ya do besides see rich and schoolwork>?

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 8:07pm EDT
that's it. i came home friday and put all my music onto my laptop. saturday i worked on my project and then rich and i went to wawa and the beach. then rich came over around noonish today and i worked on my project til 3ish and we went over grams for dinner which was lovely. and stayed for dessert so i was there til like 6ish. grams made peanut butter pie. good shit. then we came back here and i worked on my project. he left a little while ago because his parents are like raaawr you need to come home and see your cousins even though before we said you didn't have to be here soooo yeah. i decided to take a little break but i'll be getting back to work soon aaand that's what i'll be doing all day tomorrow too.

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:12pm EDT
well

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:13pm EDT
you have an amazing memory

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:13pm EDT
and it doesn't sound too boring

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:13pm EDT
it sounded pretty nice actually

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 8:15pm EDT
no it wasn't boring, i'm glad i came home this weekend. it's just shitty that i've had to spend a lot of my time doing this annoying project (which isn't perfectly proportional so i know that will hurt me) and that rich had to leave early. i was definitely spoiled being able to see him all day everyday over the summer and then tomorrow i need to go shopping for stuff to bring back to school and i'm not leavin here til later

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:17pm EDT
i am feeling your pain

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:17pm EDT
no sara today

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:17pm EDT
that hasn't happened in weeks

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:17pm EDT
i see her every night

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:17pm EDT
but not tonight

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 8:19pm EDT
/: do you plan on visiting her on weekends and things?

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:20pm EDT
yeah

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:20pm EDT
we plan to as often as possible, almost every weekend. I am still trying to figure out a way to get to her

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 8:21pm EDT
train or bus maybe?

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 8:21pm EDT
if you can't get a ride or something

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:21pm EDT
I still need to look for better deals, but most are too expensive unless I suddenly become rich

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:22pm EDT
haha

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:22pm EDT
become rich

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:22pm EDT
cause rich can drive

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:22pm EDT
funny

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:22pm EDT
anyway

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:22pm EDT
I also plan to get a license this year at some point

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 8:24pm EDT
trains aren't expensive though?

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 8:24pm EDT
can always get a job :P

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:25pm EDT
I am

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:25pm EDT
at college

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 8:29pm EDT
that'll be good then

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 8:29pm EDT
i hope college gets better the longer i'm there

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 8:29pm EDT
i'm kind of a wreck and i'm not even there at the moment

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:29pm EDT
it probly will

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:29pm EDT
Alayna said she's happy to go back

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:29pm EDT
which is odd

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:30pm EDT
but I'm happy for her

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:30pm EDT
hopefully it'll get tons better

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 8:30pm EDT
i'm not surprised, she's been doing better

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 8:30pm EDT
yeah hopefully i mean it's not that i don't want to go back or anything or that i'm miserable

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:31pm EDT
it's just not as awesome as you'd like

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:31pm EDT
?

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 8:34pm EDT
i guess so yeah and i'm just away from everybody and it's so stupid cause i'm like overly emotional for no reason and literally every time rich leaves i kinda start crying and i don't know why cause i know i'm gonna see him again soon but i can't help it and i just feel dumb. and like i don't really have any ~friends there. i wouldn't say most of the people i know are much more than acquaintances? i dunno really it's just different. it's not necessarily good or bad. it's just school. that's what it is. it's school.

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:35pm EDT
understandable

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:38pm EDT
i have a feeling

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:39pm EDT
that will happen to me and sara a lot

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 8:40pm EDT
it's really bad like i know we haven't been together that long. but it's like i dunno we just have such a good time together even if we're not really doing much but then that has to end obviously. it's just weird when you're not able to see the people you see everyday whenever you want anymore. it's something to get used to.

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 8:41pm EDT
you guys will be alright though, you'll work it out. helps to know when you both have breaks and things too lol i already know every single break i have by heart and i know the next time i'll most lkely be able to come home

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:42pm EDT
haha

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:42pm EDT
good way to know the schedule

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:42pm EDT
I understand though

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:42pm EDT
It just feels like

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:42pm EDT
the entire summer I have been mostly wasting time until I saw sara

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:42pm EDT
then I did things

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:42pm EDT
now sara is gone

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:42pm EDT
what do i do now?

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:43pm EDT
I end up just wasting time until I sleep

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 8:43pm EDT
yeah i understand. well i mean, once school starts and stuff and you get into the swing of things you'll be a little busier ya know? so it won't be so much wasting time, hopefully. you'll have work to do or studying maybe if you feel you need to do that.

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:49pm EDT
I have completly booked my days

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:49pm EDT
to make sure i am busy

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:50pm EDT
and literature club gives me tons of books to waste time on

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 8:52pm EDT
you got this all figured out man. I'm trying to find out ways for me to get ahead on my work that way when weekends come i'm not loaded with homework otherwise what's the point of visits

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:55pm EDT
fantastic plan

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:55pm EDT
you try to make time

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:55pm EDT
I try to waste it

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:55pm EDT
hey why you just give me your time!

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 8:57pm EDT
take it yo i'm already dying it's just this design and drawing class. it's just not enjoyable. this shoe project, i'll probably get a C at best on. i'm going to be taking all day tomorrow to make sure my next model is as close to the real thing as physically possible bc this one just isn't cuttin i

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 8:57pm EDT
t

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:59pm EDT
you and perfection

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:59pm EDT
need to slow down a bit

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:59pm EDT
you don't need it all the time

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:59pm EDT
but in colelge

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 8:59pm EDT
i guess it'd be useful

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 9:01pm EDT
no you don't understand

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 9:01pm EDT
it is SUPPOSED to be perfectly proportional

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 9:02pm EDT
i do understand

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 9:02pm EDT
i don't care anymore for this first one because i know i messed it up and i'm just worried about it being handed in

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 9:02pm EDT
i got a B/B- on my installation

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 9:02pm EDT
i told you that

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 9:02pm EDT
yep

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 9:02pm EDT
but i forgot already

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 9:02pm EDT
and you reminded me

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 9:02pm EDT
thank you

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 9:05pm EDT
you got it lol

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 9:12pm EDT
code

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 9:13pm EDT
i am writing

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 9:13pm EDT
i feel smart

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 9:14pm EDT
i

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 9:15pm EDT
'm Glad to hear that!

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 9:15pm EDT
i am procrastinating bad bad bad

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 9:15pm EDT
very bad

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 9:15pm EDT
i am just so sick of this cardboard. i'll be back to work soon

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 9:15pm EDT
i will

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 9:16pm EDT
is that all you have left?

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 9:16pm EDT
i have another model to go

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 9:16pm EDT
which i think will be easier than this one by far

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 9:16pm EDT
do that one first then!

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 9:17pm EDT
because the cardboard is placed vertically and my boot has that flap

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 9:17pm EDT
well i already started the horizontal one, that's what i'm working on now

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 9:17pm EDT
i only have a little more to go so

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 9:24pm EDT
cardboard doesn't sound like a very fun material

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 9:24pm EDT
at all

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
your book is made of cardboard!

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
use that as your inspiration

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
it's annoying cause i need to change my blade every like 10 mins or so lol and it's just obnoxious to cut through in general

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
use a box cutter

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
i don't have a box cutter

Nick Devlin September 2, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
buy one to stop wasting exacto knives

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 9:31pm EDT
i have a box of 100 blades I should say i'm "supposed" to change it every 10-15 mins. i don't really have to so i don't always obvi

Steph Dudak September 2, 2012 at 9:31pm EDT
but i do need to change them often enough

Nick Devlin September 4, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
STEPHPHPH

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
mocoasl

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
im sorry

Nick Devlin September 4, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
...

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
i couldnt find the keys

Nick Devlin September 4, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
ah

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
nicholas*

Nick Devlin September 4, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
haha

Nick Devlin September 4, 2012 at 7:10pm EDT
i understand

Nick Devlin September 4, 2012 at 7:10pm EDT
a bit too far right

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:10pm EDT
exactly

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:10pm EDT
so whats good nigga

Nick Devlin September 4, 2012 at 7:10pm EDT
nothin much

Nick Devlin September 4, 2012 at 7:10pm EDT
playin pokemon and listening to mumford and sons

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:11pm EDT
sounds like a pretty good time

Nick Devlin September 4, 2012 at 7:11pm EDT
good enough

Nick Devlin September 4, 2012 at 7:11pm EDT
how are you doing on your return to colelge

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:11pm EDT
im tired and i want to sleep but i cant yet

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:11pm EDT
the upside

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:11pm EDT
is

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:11pm EDT
all that work on those models paid off

Nick Devlin September 4, 2012 at 7:12pm EDT
yay!

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:12pm EDT
because my teacher loved them. like she literally said they were perfect and i don't need to redo either of them, which a lot of other kids have to do

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:12pm EDT
and the other two studio teachers took my models during the class to use to talk about and show as examples i suppose for their classes

Nick Devlin September 4, 2012 at 7:12pm EDT
boss

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:12pm EDT
like she just immediately gave em mine. so that was pretty awesome

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:12pm EDT
i spent....

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:14pm EDT
6 on saturday 6 on sunday too? annnnnnd..... 5, 4 12 9 21 WAT

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:14pm EDT
yeah pretty sure no one else spent that amount of time on their projects

Nick Devlin September 4, 2012 at 7:14pm EDT
you

Nick Devlin September 4, 2012 at 7:14pm EDT
are insane

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:14pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:14pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:14pm EDT
let me see here

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:14pm EDT
i worked from 12-6 on saturday

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:15pm EDT
then on sunday i worked from 12-3, went to grams

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:15pm EDT
came home around actually i think i came home around 6:30ish

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:15pm EDT
then i worked until rich left and that was like two hours later so that was actually 5 hours that day cause im pretty sure after he left iwas like wah and im not doing work

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:15pm EDT
then monday

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:15pm EDT
yesterday

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:17pm EDT
i don't know cause i worked throughout the day, i wanna say 12-4 but idk if that's accurate. then had dinner, worked on it for like an hour, went back over grams, then went home at 7:30 and drove back here. started working again at 11 and stopped at 3

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:17pm EDT
so like 19 still

Nick Devlin September 4, 2012 at 7:17pm EDT
to reiterate

Nick Devlin September 4, 2012 at 7:17pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:18pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 4, 2012 at 7:19pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 4, 2012 at 7:20pm EDT

The art of juggling has existed since at least the 15th century. Juggling has been recorded in numerous cultures ranging from Romans to the Aztecs even Egypt. Oftentimes people relate juggling to Medieval times when bards and jesters were commonly found entertaining their audiences with skillful displays of acrobatics and juggling along with music or comedy routines. But the real start for juggling began during the Vaudeville era of magicians and performers during the late 1800s. A style known as Gentleman Juggling began to emerge. Well-dressed men would manipulate household objects such as hats, wine bottles and cigar boxes. Unfortunately vaudeville and other variety acts began to decline with the advent of movies and television, however juggling still remained popular in its most recognized place, the Circus. More serious juggling has begun thanks to groups such as the World Juggling Federation, which holds conventions annually. These conventions hold competitions to test the professional skill of jugglers. Testing things such as endurance, technical skill, quantity of objects, etc. Overall thanks to groups such as these Juggling is becoming more and more popular with the last WJF convention airing on ESPN. Although I have yet to attend any conventions for technical juggling I have tried to find local groups and organizations the involve juggling. It has been challenging, although growing more popular, juggling is still a very niche hobby. I learned to juggle after watching an episode of Time Warp during my freshman year of High School. My dad knew a little bit and helped me get started. After I learned some basic techniques I learned more online, mainly through Youtube videos. I had pretty much given up looking for juggling groups, most were either for small children or in other states, but then I found one. A small charity group that uses juggling and other prop-based skills to help kids in poor life situations forget about their troubles and learn an interesting talent. I have volunteered at homeless shelters and summer camps for children battling cancer. If I wasnt told beforehand and these groups of kids were just in a room for me to teach I would have never known how depressing their backgrounds were. They remained cheerful and excited just like any other group of kids. And they learned so quickly! I was used to trying to teach people my own age who were always skeptical about actually learning, which made teaching very difficult. But these children had such enthusiasm that it took barely an hour for them to have 3 balls up in the air. It really is an awesome feeling knowing that you taught someone you have never met, something they will know for years to come. My life would be completely different if I had never learned how to juggle. It still remains just a passionate hobby, yet it impacts my life in many ways. I have been on commercials that my school television production class made for the clothes brand Hurley, I participated in the Toms River East Lip Dub, I entertained at my library for events to teach children reading, and I even took part in the talent show, as clichéd as that is. It amazes me that this small talent of throwing a bunch of things in the air has influenced me in so many ways. Everyone has little hobbies and things they are good at, I am glad that my hobby just so happens to be one of the most flashy and attention attracting hobbies there is. Who doesnt enjoy a little attention every now and then.

Nick Devlin September 7, 2012 at 12:58pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 7, 2012 at 11:27pm EDT
Hi Steph, How are you doing? I was wondering how you did on your project? Well I guess you heard the Giants lost but "G" was happy!!! I'm not worried they will do good the rest of the year. I was so glad to have you here for the weekend and look forward to coming down in October. Is there anything exciting going on this weekend? I hope you are not bogged down with homework and can have a little fun but be careful. I want to send you a little goodie bag so tell me what you would like or need. Aunt Dolly and Uncle Dee said they called you but could not leave a message so if you want or get a chance you can give them a call 609-748-5642. They always ask how you are doing. Sean and Kelly started school - Kelly seems pretty excited and Sean is Sean - He is looking forward to band so I guess thats good. Anthony started VoTech and is still working so he is happy. Nick is still looking for a job. "G" took him to AC Moore for a job - they are hiring so maybe he will have some luck I hope so. Well Honey we miss you and hope you are doing OK - have a nice weekend. Love Grams

Nick Devlin September 10, 2012 at 8:53pm EDT
I considered not being a dick and letting other kids answer by not putting up my hand before the teacher finished the question

Nick Devlin September 10, 2012 at 8:53pm EDT
before people even knew it was a question

Nick Devlin September 10, 2012 at 8:53pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 12, 2012 at 5:13pm EDT
laaaaaaaame

Steph Dudak September 12, 2012 at 5:13pm EDT
i should make a dictionary WORDS THAT AREN'T WORDS THAT SHOULD BE WORDS

Steph Dudak September 12, 2012 at 5:14pm EDT
then they'd become real words and be put in real dictionaries

Nick Devlin September 12, 2012 at 5:18pm EDT
thats already a thing

Nick Devlin September 12, 2012 at 5:18pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 12, 2012 at 9:18pm EDT
Who and why

Nick Devlin September 12, 2012 at 9:18pm EDT
http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=4630286681965&set=at.1179238127908.27986.1436801205.100000903051314&type=1&relevant_count=1&ref=nf

Steph Dudak September 12, 2012 at 9:22pm EDT
So what's the problem exactly

Nick Devlin September 12, 2012 at 9:22pm EDT
cigarettes make me angry

Nick Devlin September 12, 2012 at 9:23pm EDT
i instantly assume you are stupid if I ever see one

Steph Dudak September 12, 2012 at 9:23pm EDT
You can't assume someone's stupid because they smoke.

Nick Devlin September 12, 2012 at 9:24pm EDT
i do

Nick Devlin September 12, 2012 at 9:24pm EDT
i know it's not true

Nick Devlin September 12, 2012 at 9:24pm EDT
but ugh

Steph Dudak September 12, 2012 at 9:24pm EDT
Well I don't agree with that by any means. I don't like smoking as much as the next person

Nick Devlin September 12, 2012 at 9:24pm EDT
anyway

Nick Devlin September 12, 2012 at 9:25pm EDT
How about I rephrase

Nick Devlin September 12, 2012 at 9:25pm EDT
I know plennty of adults that smoke that I think are intelligent

Nick Devlin September 12, 2012 at 9:25pm EDT
but they are still younger

Nick Devlin September 12, 2012 at 9:25pm EDT
and i've met excpetions

Nick Devlin September 12, 2012 at 9:25pm EDT
but overall

Nick Devlin September 12, 2012 at 9:26pm EDT
kids our age that openly display they smoke

Nick Devlin September 12, 2012 at 9:26pm EDT
are usually obnoxious

Nick Devlin September 12, 2012 at 9:26pm EDT
I didn't mean stupid as in unintelligent, i meant it as in they have a bad personality

Nick Devlin September 12, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
ugh idk that picture just made me angry

Nick Devlin September 12, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
so how is your writing going?

Steph Dudak September 12, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
I'm not writing

Steph Dudak September 12, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
I'm in the studio working on my drawings

Steph Dudak September 12, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
Then I need to work on my model

Nick Devlin September 12, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
thats the thing you said you had to do

Steph Dudak September 12, 2012 at 9:31pm EDT
And I need to figure out where I'm using six different line weights cause beats me

Steph Dudak September 12, 2012 at 9:31pm EDT
Five sorry

Nick Devlin September 12, 2012 at 9:31pm EDT
hmm, well I have no clue. Just croshatch or something idk

Steph Dudak September 12, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
That Is completely irrelevant to the problem lol thanks for trying tho

Nick Devlin September 12, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
thus my numerous idks

Nick Devlin September 12, 2012 at 9:33pm EDT
i dont really know what youre doing but Im sure you can handle it

Steph Dudak September 12, 2012 at 9:35pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 12:19am EDT
Just updating you on my life. Or what's left of it, cause I'm probably gonna kill myself soon. Three more drawings to go. And a model. This piece of Mylar is so ugly cause I messed up so much Whatev I'm tired But oh we'll Bye

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 6:57am EDT
appreciate the update

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 6:58am EDT
your life is thriving!

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 6:58am EDT
the stressed over worked part of your life at least. I can never tell if you are really good at school or really bad

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 6:59am EDT
you always get perfects, but you go insane while getting them

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 11:21am EDT
I'm really bad at school

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 11:22am EDT
I wrote on my math test that a limit is equal to zero. It's not. Because 0/0 is not 0. I am an idiot.

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 11:52am EDT
I JUST LEARNED THAT

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 11:52am EDT
its not undefined either!

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 11:52am EDT
Usualy x/0 is undefined

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 11:53am EDT
but 0/0 is indeterminable

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 11:53am EDT
I understand limits btw. If this is really the hardest thing we do this year as my teacher said I am a very happy person

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 11:53am EDT
I also learned logarithms

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 11:53am EDT
and I understand trig if not how to solve equations and create equations based on diagrams

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 12:09pm EDT
That's very exciting

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 12:14pm EDT
I KNOW

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 12:14pm EDT
I'm sorry about the question you missed though :(

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 12:17pm EDT
Me too because I originally had something else

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 12:19pm EDT
was the something else correct?

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 12:19pm EDT
Idk if it was correct But it was closer to being correct

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 12:23pm EDT
lolol fucked up another drawing my life rocks

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 12:31pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 3:48pm EDT
My presentation went very well, basically had all good things to say. Betty told me everything was amazing including my drawings which is shocking.

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 3:58pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 3:58pm EDT
not really

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 3:58pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 3:58pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 3:58pm EDT
some asshole remark

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 3:58pm EDT
I can think of one now

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 3:58pm EDT
I'll get back to you

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 4:02pm EDT
Awwwww thanks nicholas :D

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 4:03pm EDT
I think I expect her reaction to my work to be the same as Mornas. It never is tho

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:37pm EDT
grr I forgot to think of something mean while I was gone

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:38pm EDT
oh well

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:38pm EDT
i'm allowed to slip every now and then

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 7:38pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 7:39pm EDT
LOL i'll take it

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 7:39pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:39pm EDT
lackadaisical

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:40pm EDT
didnt do much

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:40pm EDT
went to class, read up on some more topics I want to learn

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:40pm EDT
went to psych whatched some weird ass documentary

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 7:40pm EDT
i first read that as like lackatastical or some shit and i was like wtf is that

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:40pm EDT
yeah I really like that word lately this is like the 4th time i've said it this week

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:41pm EDT
then i came home and read a book

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:41pm EDT
I also helped jorge with his computer at some point

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 7:42pm EDT
fun day i see

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:44pm EDT
fun enough

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 7:44pm EDT
what was the documentary about

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:44pm EDT
oh my god

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:44pm EDT
weird ass 80s intro

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:44pm EDT
i cant even describe it

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:44pm EDT
it was like one of those announcers of weird ass shit

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:44pm EDT
like from the twilight zone

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:44pm EDT
that kind of voice and vocab

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:44pm EDT
describing the field of psychology

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:45pm EDT
with random ass videos of futurey looking machines and labs and old computers

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:45pm EDT
Then they go somewhat normal and have badly shot interviews of psychiatrists and psychologists and whatnot

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:46pm EDT
the first experiment

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:46pm EDT
was about scaring college girls

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:46pm EDT
no lie

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:46pm EDT
the gathered a group of girls and said they would be performing painful shock therapy that 'should' have no lasting harm

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:46pm EDT
all FOR SCIENCE

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:47pm EDT
and their all... wtf

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:47pm EDT
they're*

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 7:47pm EDT
o.o

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:47pm EDT
then the have a control group

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 7:47pm EDT
haha SHOULD

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:47pm EDT
and the same guy is like

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:47pm EDT
yeah this shit wont hurt itsa good

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:47pm EDT
should feel like a tingly ticklish feeling

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:47pm EDT
a couple seconds and its gone

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:48pm EDT
and the announcer guy explains all this junk about proper procedure and steps after the experiment etc

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:48pm EDT
so anyway the test worked

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:49pm EDT
(test to see if humans bonded more when frightened)

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:49pm EDT
and the guys like yo we just playin, s'all good get the fuck out

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:50pm EDT
and that was the first half, excluding all the weird animations they had while describint the experiment

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 7:50pm EDT
sounds like a fun experiment to participate in

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:51pm EDT
i'd imagine so

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:51pm EDT
the next one is awful

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:51pm EDT
i cant wait to tell sara about it

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:51pm EDT
its involved animal testing

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:51pm EDT
guess the animal

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 7:52pm EDT
CAT!

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 7:52pm EDT
?

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:52pm EDT
yup

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:52pm EDT
kittens to be specific

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:52pm EDT
new born

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 7:52pm EDT
D:

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 7:52pm EDT
WHAT DID THEY DO

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:52pm EDT
nothing that bad

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:52pm EDT
it was kind of funny in a mean way

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:53pm EDT
they were so derpy

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:53pm EDT
they wanted to test visual development

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:53pm EDT
like say you couldnt use your eyes for the first few months of your life

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:53pm EDT
would you still be able to see when you opened them?

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:53pm EDT
how long would it take to become permanently blind

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:54pm EDT
or at least unable to interpret to see the world around you

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:54pm EDT
would the brain develope diffirently without visual input

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:54pm EDT
SO

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:54pm EDT
they kept bunches of kittens in pitch black for differing amount of time

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:55pm EDT
a month two months 6 months

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:55pm EDT
then put them in a maze to see how well they navigated and how well they could see exits

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:55pm EDT
it was funny as hell

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:55pm EDT
these derpy cats walking into walls

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:55pm EDT
ALSO

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:55pm EDT
whenever they interviewed one guy

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:56pm EDT
he was just playing with cats while he talked

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:56pm EDT
like his job is to just hang out with cats and occasionally document them being silly

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:56pm EDT
thats like tumblr's dream

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:56pm EDT
the other guy just sat in this weird computer room

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:56pm EDT
and EVERY SINGLE TIME

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:56pm EDT
they showed him talking

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:57pm EDT
the camera slowly zoomed up on his face

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:57pm EDT
like thats so awkward

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:57pm EDT
this one time by the time he finished talking all you saw was his eyes

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 7:57pm EDT
that is awkward

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 7:57pm EDT
but the guy that gets to just hang out and play with kittens for a living

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 7:58pm EDT
living the dream yo

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:58pm EDT
ikr

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 7:58pm EDT
that is some experiment omg

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:58pm EDT
i wonder if you can keep them as pets when the experiment is done

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:58pm EDT
thatd be sweet

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 7:58pm EDT
that'd be awesome

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:58pm EDT
i own my very own cat

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 7:58pm EDT
of science@!!1

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 7:58pm EDT
!!!

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 8:00pm EDT
anyway

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 8:00pm EDT
yeah

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 8:01pm EDT
that was the movie

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 8:01pm EDT
that's pretty cooll

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 8:06pm EDT
it was certainly amusing

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 8:43pm EDT
i can't change the volume with the volume keys on my laptop all of a suddenly

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 8:44pm EDT
thats irritating

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 8:45pm EDT
it's very irritating cause whenever i log in also it gives me this like error message thing about some thing or something

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 8:45pm EDT
wish I knew how to help

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 8:45pm EDT
have you asking rich yet? He fixes things

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 8:47pm EDT
noope

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 8:48pm EDT
ill figure it out somehow

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 8:48pm EDT
strong independent woman dont need help from no man

Steph Dudak September 13, 2012 at 8:50pm EDT
you knoo

Nick Devlin September 13, 2012 at 10:12pm EDT
yeah i do knoo

Nick Devlin September 14, 2012 at 9:20am EDT
i found the perfect way to learn in my comp class

Nick Devlin September 14, 2012 at 9:20am EDT
the teacher starts rambling about idk what

Nick Devlin September 14, 2012 at 9:20am EDT
I figure out the main topic she's trying to convey

Nick Devlin September 14, 2012 at 9:20am EDT
then I google it

Nick Devlin September 14, 2012 at 9:20am EDT
it's working perfectly

Nick Devlin September 14, 2012 at 9:20am EDT
i love laptops

Nick Devlin September 14, 2012 at 9:21am EDT
i actually take notes now

Steph Dudak September 14, 2012 at 9:26am EDT
Flawless plan haha

Nick Devlin September 14, 2012 at 9:26am EDT
i thought so

Nick Devlin September 14, 2012 at 9:28am EDT
trig isnt that bad

Steph Dudak September 14, 2012 at 9:28am EDT
What're you learning rn?

Nick Devlin September 14, 2012 at 9:29am EDT
no we are learning limits, but I want to understand basics of trig before we get there

Nick Devlin September 14, 2012 at 9:29am EDT
everyone freaks out when i mentions i'm in calc and dont know any trig

Steph Dudak September 14, 2012 at 9:30am EDT
Meh You don't really need it yet though? Not for limits. It's just algebra pretty much

Nick Devlin September 14, 2012 at 9:30am EDT
exactly

Nick Devlin September 14, 2012 at 9:30am EDT
occasionally they mention sin or something in the equation

Nick Devlin September 14, 2012 at 9:30am EDT
but i just treat it as a variable and its fine

Nick Devlin September 14, 2012 at 9:31am EDT
how is your math going?

Nick Devlin September 14, 2012 at 9:31am EDT
still annoying

Nick Devlin September 14, 2012 at 9:31am EDT

Nick Devlin September 14, 2012 at 9:41am EDT
and now i can answer when the teacher goes, What kind of graph is this? and people just say random words i dont understand. They obviously dont understand either since they are always wrong

Nick Devlin September 14, 2012 at 9:41am EDT
but at least they can guess and check tehir way into correctness

Nick Devlin September 14, 2012 at 9:45am EDT
but yeah is fun

Nick Devlin September 14, 2012 at 9:45am EDT

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
that way your set

Steph Dudak September 17, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
no

Steph Dudak September 17, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
she emailed me back just now

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:10pm EDT
yay!

Steph Dudak September 17, 2012 at 7:12pm EDT
which should i do? not 4 or 6 though i'm also eventually going to have to make it 3 dimensional im pretty sure

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:13pm EDT
hm

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:14pm EDT
7 could look really cool 3 dimensionaly

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:14pm EDT
since the lines are all just lines not planes you could mess with perspective

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:14pm EDT
same goes for 8 i suppose but the colours arent as fun

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:15pm EDT
i also just like how 9 and 3 look

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:15pm EDT
I don't know exactly how you're supposed to review like what you learned

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:15pm EDT
so I just picked the ones I liked most

Steph Dudak September 17, 2012 at 7:16pm EDT
i just have to pick one it doesnt have anything to do with something i learned

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:21pm EDT
oh

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:21pm EDT
hmmm

Steph Dudak September 17, 2012 at 7:21pm EDT
it's just that

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:21pm EDT
then yeah

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:21pm EDT
the bottom

Steph Dudak September 17, 2012 at 7:21pm EDT
i'll eventually have to build this

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:21pm EDT
left

Steph Dudak September 17, 2012 at 7:21pm EDT
so

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:23pm EDT
yeah

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:23pm EDT
that would look so cool

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:23pm EDT
you could make it a web of ropes

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:23pm EDT
or you could have lines from the side

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:23pm EDT
but then when you turn it around its all fun shapes

Steph Dudak September 17, 2012 at 7:24pm EDT
woods

Steph Dudak September 17, 2012 at 7:24pm EDT
it's made of wood

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:24pm EDT
?

Steph Dudak September 17, 2012 at 7:24pm EDT
balsa and bass

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:24pm EDT
my second option still words

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:24pm EDT
works*

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:26pm EDT
or instead of ropes dowels work fine too

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:26pm EDT
but yeah idk

Steph Dudak September 17, 2012 at 7:26pm EDT
no

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:26pm EDT
I know whats in my head

Steph Dudak September 17, 2012 at 7:26pm EDT
i already know what i need to make it out of lol

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:26pm EDT
idk what you do

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:26pm EDT
I am not helpful on this topic

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:27pm EDT
just go with the prettiest one

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:27pm EDT
I like bottom left and top right

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:27pm EDT
but I really am not sure

Steph Dudak September 17, 2012 at 7:35pm EDT
most complicated things lol

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:36pm EDT
fo real

Steph Dudak September 17, 2012 at 7:36pm EDT
7 is easier in separating though

Steph Dudak September 17, 2012 at 7:36pm EDT
like what's in front what's in back

Steph Dudak September 17, 2012 at 7:36pm EDT
i just wish there were more blocks of color

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:36pm EDT
that is true

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:36pm EDT
how crative can you get?

Steph Dudak September 17, 2012 at 7:36pm EDT
maybe ill do 8

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:37pm EDT
like what are the dimmensions of the project?

Steph Dudak September 17, 2012 at 7:37pm EDT
idk

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:37pm EDT
so you could technically add objects that aren't visible from this perspective?

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:38pm EDT
like ones that are hidden behind other blocks?

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:38pm EDT
that'd be cool

Steph Dudak September 17, 2012 at 7:39pm EDT
maybe 3

Steph Dudak September 17, 2012 at 7:39pm EDT
i think 3

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:43pm EDT
?

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:43pm EDT
3 what

Steph Dudak September 17, 2012 at 7:43pm EDT
the painting

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:43pm EDT
ah

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:43pm EDT
fun

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 7:43pm EDT
the top right one yeah?

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 10:31pm EDT
but hint that it is animal related

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 10:32pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 10:32pm EDT
she has to change her name

Nick Devlin September 17, 2012 at 10:32pm EDT
trick her into thinking that eventually she will be allowed to open it

I never expect high grades in that class. Let me tell you what's written on the sheet tho

Steph Dudak September 18, 2012 at 6:12pm EDT
1. Concept- Degree of difficulty: high 2. Development- overall design quality and inventiveness: high Consistency of effort: very high 3. Product- drawing craft: medium Model craft: very high Verbal presentation: high Completion: very high Had all models and drawings Comments: beautiful craft and care taken with this project. Don't let yourself get easily frustrated as it can show in the work. Learn when to step away from a project and reassess what you're doing. Also trust yourself more, your wire model was so much better than you think it was.

Nick Devlin September 18, 2012 at 6:17pm EDT
haah

i don't follow politics so lol i also don't know how recent this is? http://change.gov/agenda/foreign_policy_agenda/ i just summed up the foreign policy with that i didn't go into any detail yet. aaaand now i shall send what i have so far

Steph Dudak September 23, 2012 at 9:08pm EDT
FOREIGN POLICY Obamas foreign policy is a plan to end the war in Iraq as well as finish the fight with the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan. The plan also serves to secure nuclear weapons and loose nuclear materials from terrorists, renew American diplomacy, and support strong alliances and eventually reach lasting peace in Israeli-Palestinian conflict. CULTURAL VALUES WOMENS RIGHTS/ABORTION Obama takes a pro-choice stand on abortion. He believes that the health care choices of women are personal decisions and should not have any interference from politicians. Furthermore, because of Obamacare, insurance plans will begin to fully cover birth control as a part of womens preventive care (which also includes things such as mammograms and cancer screenings). Something Obama plans to end is charging women more than men for the same health insurance coverage. EQUAL RIGHTS Issues regarding the LGBT community also differ between the two candidates because Obama highly supports the LGBT community. He supports same-sex marriage and repealed Dont Ask, Dont Tell so gay and lesbian service members do not have to lie about who they are to serve their country. He also extended hospital visitation and medical decision-making rights to LGBT couples, signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, and endorsed the Respect for Marriage Act. Aside from this, policies have been enacted by Obama that will promote the hiring of disabled people, increase funding for students with disabilities, provide Americans with access to affordable health care, and improve accessibility standards. ECONOMY HEALTHCARE (OBAMACARE) Obamacare intends to put the health of families first, ensuring access to free preventive care and protecting consumers from insurance company abuseseven if you already have insurance. The Affordable Care Act holds insurance companies responsible, putting an end to abuses such as capping or dropping your coverage when you get sick. This act also helps people with Medicare save on the care they need to stay healthy which includes free preventive services to lower costs on prescription drugs and monthly premiums. Obama also plans to put an end to women being charged more than men for the same coverage by health insurance companies.

Nick Devlin September 23, 2012 at 9:08pm EDT
loose nuclear materials from terrorists

Nick Devlin September 23, 2012 at 9:08pm EDT
what does that mean?

Nick Devlin September 23, 2012 at 9:09pm EDT
never refer to anything as obamacare in government writing if you wish to be taken seriously

Steph Dudak September 23, 2012 at 9:09pm EDT
it's not a formal paper

Steph Dudak September 23, 2012 at 9:09pm EDT
it has headings

Steph Dudak September 23, 2012 at 9:10pm EDT
it's often referred to as that and honestly i don't think my teacher will give a fuck cause he's called it that

Nick Devlin September 23, 2012 at 9:10pm EDT
stupid man

Steph Dudak September 23, 2012 at 9:51pm EDT
nuclear weapons and materials that aren't very well guarded, can easily fall into the wrong hands ie terrorists

I just skip sections because I can't think how to continue my thoughts

Nick Devlin September 24, 2012 at 8:15pm EDT
Descriptive Essay Libraries are what . Stories and memories passing from each hand to the next resting patiently on shelves in between readers, waiting for the next mind to enrich. A library is an organized collection of resources made accessible to a defined community for reference or borrowing. (Library) In the particular case of my library, the community that uses it is comprised of friends and family. Two 6-foot bookshelves are snugly fitted into what once used to be a closet. The shelves that once held coats and hats have been discarded and replaced by shelves that hold hardcovers and paperbacks. Books endeavor to be organized, with fiction lining the shelves alphabetically and nonfiction precariously stacked atop each bookshelf. But as in every group, this bunch of books has its rebels. Novels creep deep into nonfiction territory and the occasional reference book finds its way onto my shelves. Not only books reside on these shelves though. Knickknacks and doodads aplenty adorn the boards, each with its own story. On the top shelf in front of my series of Harry Potter books a bluish glass egg containing swirling columns of trapped air pockets sits. My granda bought be the ornament on our trip to Scotland. A picture frame with images of the color guard I was a part of for two seasons is on the same shelf, given to me as a gift after graduating. One of the high quality model trucks that I receive every Christmas from the Hess Company is on a different level. All of these things that have as much of a sentimental history to me as the actual annals elsewhere in my library. Those memories are brought up even more clearly thanks to the faint scent of dried glue and old paper emanating from each book. Every book I have read has its own set of memories. The book Flyte by Angie Sage remind me of when I used to visit the horse races in the winter with my father, the usual crowds brought in by summer had faded, the only horses left were those on the hundreds of televisions lining every wall. Books are more than just the story in and of themselves, they create new stories of the time you spent with them. Even the library as a whole brings up memories of the growth it has had throughout my life. The library started out as only a small 2 shelf bookcase stuffed with childrens mystery novels and scientific animal books and the pride of every reader, Dr. Seuss books. At some point I read two series that influenced my life more than any other, Harry Potter and Eragon. Opening my imagination to magic and dragons and fantastic creatures and places, these books led me to more books like them. After a few years of collecting there were more books lying in piles around my room than there were actually in the bookcase. This led to a larger bookcase being added, proudly standing with 5 shelves. It was made from a light wood and had a flimsy appearance that was enhanced once laden with dozens of heavy texts. The books, mainly science fiction and fantasy, were collected from their various collections around my rooms and organized into rows on the new bookshelves. But that was not the end of the growth spurt. Yet another bookcase was added, this one of a much darker, purple hue that was almost black. The library was now in its current placement, but the books always change. Old books taken from public libraries that no longer want them, new books bought fresh from the store, worn books passed along circles of friends, and some books that remain constant, the ones I have had since I first began, all going in and out of my library. One day I hope for my library to grow even more, possibly swelling in to an entire room. Since I was young I had this notion that the more books that were in my library, the smarter I would become. I discovered that this was true, but in a less dramatic sense. I cannot just buy books and put them in my library in order to gain knowledge as if I were a computer downloading information. I have to read and understand the books in my library.

Nick Devlin September 24, 2012 at 8:16pm EDT
Like I stop mid sentence a couple times

Steph Dudak September 24, 2012 at 8:25pm EDT
the first paragraph has me a bit confused second paragraph-- what once was a closet, instead of what once used to be. sounds awkie. or say that used to be cause you use the shelves that once in the next sentence my grandpa bought me* the ornament All of these things that have as much of a sentimental history to me as the actual annals elsewhere in my library take out that? the book flyte reminds* Even the library as a whole brings up memories of the growth it has had throughout my life The growth of the library? this sentence didn't sit well in my head. . . . childrens mystery novels and scientific animal books and the pride of every reader, Dr. Seuss books (take out the and between novels and scientific, put a comma) purple hue that was almost black almost black is irrelevant. if i was a reader i would not care to know that. do you mention any other bookshelf colors? if not fix that because it's unimportant unless the purple is significant in some way. it's not bad i actually kinda like it

Steph Dudak September 24, 2012 at 8:25pm EDT
is that it finished though? cause i feel like that last paragraph there's something more you want to say

Nick Devlin September 24, 2012 at 8:25pm EDT
none of the paragraphs were finished

Steph Dudak September 24, 2012 at 8:26pm EDT
the last especially stands out

Nick Devlin September 24, 2012 at 8:26pm EDT
and it is a descriptive so I am supposed to use all of my senses

Nick Devlin September 24, 2012 at 8:26pm EDT
and I will work on it while I implement your corrections

Steph Dudak September 24, 2012 at 8:27pm EDT
uhhh one sec i'm gonna go through the end and beginning of paragraphs again

Nick Devlin September 24, 2012 at 8:30pm EDT
have fun!

Steph Dudak September 24, 2012 at 8:31pm EDT
you say the community that uses your library is compromised of friends and family the next paragraph you don't address that idk that seems kinda funny to me cause it sets up potential for like a personal anecdote about said family and friends and your library the whole first paragraph just has to be fixed from second to third you talk about books creating new stories of the time you spent with them and then how it brings up memories don't say new stories, just say stories. i read the sentence once and this is just me being dumb but i thought of the sentence as new stories and then memories. future and then past yk? so maybe take out the new and reword the last sentence of paragraph two a bit three to four? is that what i'm on? four is the last paragraph? i think it's fine how it goes in between those. you just need to close the paragraph

Nick Devlin September 24, 2012 at 8:33pm EDT
I am horrid at intros

Nick Devlin September 24, 2012 at 8:33pm EDT
so yeah

Nick Devlin September 24, 2012 at 8:34pm EDT
I just don't know how to introduce things without sounding like I'm two

Nick Devlin September 24, 2012 at 8:34pm EDT
I want it to be clear what's going on though

Steph Dudak September 24, 2012 at 8:35pm EDT
one min

Nick Devlin September 24, 2012 at 8:35pm EDT
yeah the first paragraph is supposed to be about family and friends and junk with libraries

Nick Devlin September 24, 2012 at 8:36pm EDT
Like sort of describing how I *use* my library

Nick Devlin September 24, 2012 at 8:36pm EDT
idk

Steph Dudak September 24, 2012 at 8:37pm EDT
Stories and memories passing from each hand to the next, resting patiently on shelves in between readers, waiting for the next mind to enrich. i really like this sentence, i'm just trying to figure out how to make it into an intro while tying it to what you have now kinda

Nick Devlin September 24, 2012 at 8:39pm EDT
hmm

Steph Dudak September 24, 2012 at 8:39pm EDT
i don't like how you define library as an actual definition after that

Steph Dudak September 24, 2012 at 8:39pm EDT
it's too stark a contrast

Nick Devlin September 24, 2012 at 8:40pm EDT
I know, I am trying to fit a transtition now

Steph Dudak September 24, 2012 at 8:40pm EDT
like the definition is this just cut thing

Steph Dudak September 24, 2012 at 8:40pm EDT
textbook like while the sentence before isn't quite textbook like

Nick Devlin September 24, 2012 at 8:46pm EDT
Stories and memories passing from each hand to the next resting patiently on shelves in between readers, waiting for the next mind to enrich. Libraries have been a place of stored knowledge for centuries, passing down information between people who may have never met. One of the greatest communal efforts to share information, Wikipedia, states that a library is an organized collection of resources made accessible to a defined community for reference or borrowing. (Library) In the particular case of my library, the community that uses it is much more personal comprised of friends and family, that contribute to and benefit from my library.

Nick Devlin September 24, 2012 at 8:47pm EDT
I'm getting closer

Steph Dudak September 24, 2012 at 8:47pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 25, 2012 at 7:44pm EDT
nah but i don't find it that compelling i guess i don't know like i said it's not something i'm really interested in so it bores me and i'm already tired as all hell

Steph Dudak September 25, 2012 at 7:45pm EDT
so it's going over my head

Nick Devlin September 25, 2012 at 7:45pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 25, 2012 at 7:45pm EDT
i don't have time

Nick Devlin September 25, 2012 at 7:45pm EDT

Steph Dudak September 25, 2012 at 7:45pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 25, 2012 at 7:46pm EDT
I looked over them, they are intelligent

Nick Devlin September 25, 2012 at 7:46pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 26, 2012 at 7:53pm EDT

Nick Devlin September 26, 2012 at 7:53pm EDT

good bye!

good luck

Nick Devlin September 27, 2012 at 11:13am EDT
I think there are derivatives on my test

Nick Devlin September 27, 2012 at 11:13am EDT
what is a derivative

Nick Devlin September 27, 2012 at 11:13am EDT
i am scared

Steph Dudak September 27, 2012 at 11:14am EDT
derivatives are easy there are also like little rules to help make them easy

Steph Dudak September 27, 2012 at 11:14am EDT
for example

Steph Dudak September 27, 2012 at 11:15am EDT
the derivative of any constant is 0 x = 1 x^2 = 2x --- the reason for this is because you move the exponent 2, and make it a coefficient, then you subtract one from the exponent (2-1=1, therefore x) you do the same for other powers. so if its x^4, the derivative is 4x^3

Steph Dudak September 27, 2012 at 11:16am EDT
if you have more than one like term so lets say you have

Nick Devlin September 27, 2012 at 11:16am EDT
x^73=73x^72?

Steph Dudak September 27, 2012 at 11:16am EDT
exactly

Nick Devlin September 27, 2012 at 11:16am EDT
funfun

Nick Devlin September 27, 2012 at 11:17am EDT
continue

Steph Dudak September 27, 2012 at 11:17am EDT
2x^2 + 5x +1 you add each derivative i mean when we were first doing it he had us do it in steps but i find no need to do that

Steph Dudak September 27, 2012 at 11:17am EDT
so 2x^2, the derivative is 4x because 2(2)x^1

Steph Dudak September 27, 2012 at 11:17am EDT
then the derivative of 5x is 5 because 5(1) = 5 and then 1=0

Steph Dudak September 27, 2012 at 11:18am EDT
so the derivative of 2x^2 + 5x + 1 = 4x + 5

Nick Devlin September 27, 2012 at 11:18am EDT
mkay

Nick Devlin September 27, 2012 at 11:18am EDT
that's odd but whatever

Nick Devlin September 27, 2012 at 11:18am EDT

Nick Devlin October 2, 2012 at 10:22pm EDT
I knew i was hungry and did it anyway

Nick Devlin October 2, 2012 at 10:22pm EDT
I was a bit sleep deprived too...

Steph Dudak October 2, 2012 at 10:23pm EDT
-shakes head-

Steph Dudak October 2, 2012 at 10:23pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 2, 2012 at 10:25pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
marshall likes mitt romney </3

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
i am crying inside right now

Steph Dudak October 3, 2012 at 9:48pm EDT
Mitt Romney is an idiot

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 9:49pm EDT
he's doing a good job of seeming reasonable right now though

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 9:51pm EDT
The guy asking questions

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 9:51pm EDT
needs a button to turn off the guy's mic

Steph Dudak October 3, 2012 at 9:51pm EDT
SERIOUSLY

Steph Dudak October 3, 2012 at 9:52pm EDT
He needs to be more assertive

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 9:52pm EDT
They NEVER are

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 9:52pm EDT
its been years of this shit

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 9:52pm EDT
hahhaha

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 9:52pm EDT
'let's not"

Steph Dudak October 3, 2012 at 9:52pm EDT
ahahha

Steph Dudak October 3, 2012 at 9:52pm EDT
YES

Steph Dudak October 3, 2012 at 9:53pm EDT
EXACTLY WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY LOL

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 9:54pm EDT
I wish it was easier to follow

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 9:54pm EDT
they need like little graphics in the corner to keep track of the points they make

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 9:54pm EDT
because they skip around too much

Steph Dudak October 3, 2012 at 9:55pm EDT
It'd be cool if they answered questions directly Politics

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 9:56pm EDT
I sort of understand why they can't

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 9:56pm EDT
since the topics are so complicated

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 9:56pm EDT
but still

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 9:56pm EDT
a one sentence summary

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 9:56pm EDT
not that hard

Steph Dudak October 3, 2012 at 9:56pm EDT
Still they never get a general thing Except Romney did list

Steph Dudak October 3, 2012 at 9:56pm EDT
Those five things

Steph Dudak October 3, 2012 at 9:56pm EDT
For jobs

Steph Dudak October 3, 2012 at 9:57pm EDT
That was the most straightforward thing I've heard him say I think

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 9:57pm EDT
i like how he lists things

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 9:57pm EDT
but the lists make no sense

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 9:58pm EDT
and I hate when polls are used as fact

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 9:58pm EDT
polls are never accurate

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 10:00pm EDT
wow obama

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 10:00pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 10:00pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 10:02pm EDT
"we didn't cut the program we don't have"

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 10:02pm EDT
"democrats aren't dicks and vote for things that republicans propose"

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 10:03pm EDT
a few things I got from romneys last point

Steph Dudak October 3, 2012 at 10:03pm EDT
I think Obamas angry haha that five second thing yo

Steph Dudak October 3, 2012 at 10:03pm EDT
YO

Steph Dudak October 3, 2012 at 10:04pm EDT
We didn't cut it I mean we didn't cut it But we didn't have it

Steph Dudak October 3, 2012 at 10:04pm EDT
Well shoot that's swell

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 10:05pm EDT
I hate how hard it is to fact check

Nick Devlin October 3, 2012 at 10:06pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 3, 2012 at 10:09pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 11, 2012 at 10:30pm EDT
was abortion

Nick Devlin October 11, 2012 at 10:30pm EDT
because they answered the question almost

Steph Dudak October 11, 2012 at 10:30pm EDT
debates aren't interesting they suck

Steph Dudak October 11, 2012 at 10:30pm EDT
well

Steph Dudak October 11, 2012 at 10:30pm EDT
these

Steph Dudak October 11, 2012 at 10:31pm EDT
they have the potential to not suck

Nick Devlin October 11, 2012 at 10:31pm EDT
but so often they are ruined

Nick Devlin October 11, 2012 at 10:32pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:31pm EDT
guess what?!

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:31pm EDT
what!

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:32pm EDT
i'm really boring :(

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:33pm EDT
o

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
i was expecting a story or something

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
im trynna make study models that abstract my painting

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
and my whole concept is structure because of tension and compression

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
but idk how to do that with these study models lololol

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
idk what that means :)

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
what tension and compression and structure is

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:35pm EDT
and making models that abstract your painting

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:35pm EDT
i didnt know that abstract could be a verb

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:36pm EDT
how could you know

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:36pm EDT
not *

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:36pm EDT
know

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:36pm EDT
to make my painting abstract

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:36pm EDT
is that better

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:36pm EDT
idk

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:36pm EDT
ahh

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:36pm EDT
so it was not abstract and now you are making it abstract

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:36pm EDT
duuuh & you know what all those words mean nick devlin! >:P

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:37pm EDT
i know but you used a lot of them at once

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:37pm EDT
and i was watching monty python

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:38pm EDT
i'm guessing the rest of what you said how to do with your idea being something that involves the stretchiness of your model?

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:39pm EDT
http://0.tqn.com/d/arthistory/1/0/e/2/1/Salvador-Dali-Soft-Construction-with-Boiled-Beans-Premonition-of-Civil-War-1936.jpg top left, the hand

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
tension the torso between the two feet on the right compression also

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
the hand on the bottom left

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
and the foot on the bottom right (and also the box)

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
structural

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:41pm EDT
even though theyre dead and decaying and do not show those two things alone like the top half, they serve structural purposes

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:41pm EDT
im taking the head out

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:41pm EDT
the problem is in abstracting this

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:41pm EDT
thats what confused me

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:41pm EDT
its already about as abstract as you get

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:42pm EDT
it's not though think planes and things so for the torso thats between the two feet that goes down to the hand i have four 3X6" rectangles im stacking together

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:42pm EDT
cause it looks thicker and heavier in the painting

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:42pm EDT
oh but the materials only lke

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:42pm EDT
1/16" thick

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:43pm EDT
so for the box im putting two 1x3" ones together, but from the side so it's only about 1/8" when looking from the front

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:43pm EDT
but idk how to translate the whole tension idea into this

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:45pm EDT
by tension, do you mean like... that the hand is clenching?

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:46pm EDT
mhm and stretching the breast from the upper torso of the ~body

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:47pm EDT
so that is a breast

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:47pm EDT
yes

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:47pm EDT
that was gonna be my next question since its hard to tell

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:47pm EDT
gonna do anthing with the beans?

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:48pm EDT
nah

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:48pm EDT
it's got nothing to do with my concept

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:48pm EDT
gotcha

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:48pm EDT
i dont feel theyre important

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:48pm EDT
beans can make things pretty tense though

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:48pm EDT
especially if like your giving a speech and you ate them a couple hours ago

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:48pm EDT
clenching pretty hard

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:48pm EDT
just sayin

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:48pm EDT
-.-

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:49pm EDT
irrelevant!

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:49pm EDT
:D

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:49pm EDT
yeah i know

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:50pm EDT
what materials are you allowed to use?

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:50pm EDT
im using matte board

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:50pm EDT
think of it like

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:50pm EDT
i cant think of anything good to compare it to if you dont know what it is

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:51pm EDT
think of a bunch of posterboard stacked together. it's gota thickness and it's hard its not like cardboard though

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:51pm EDT
well actually

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:51pm EDT
more like what's on the back of notebooks

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:51pm EDT
foamlike

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:51pm EDT
no

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:51pm EDT
ni

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:51pm EDT
i understand

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:51pm EDT
no

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:51pm EDT
yeah

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:51pm EDT
i mean its not that close to that

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:51pm EDT
like what they make boxes out of?

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:51pm EDT
but its hard like that and thicker yk

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:51pm EDT
but easily cut with an xacto knife

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:52pm EDT
fun

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:52pm EDT
that's all you're allowed?'

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:52pm EDT
well it was this or bristol which is essentially really nice, thick paper that is much more expensive than this

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:52pm EDT
or butterboard

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:52pm EDT
but they dont have that in the school store

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:52pm EDT
and i wasnt about to go to blick or utrecht

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:52pm EDT
alright

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:53pm EDT
so I'm really not sur ehow you'd display tension

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:53pm EDT
I would've just been lazy and put some kind of elastic wrapping around the sturcture to make it look strained

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:54pm EDT
cause idgf

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:54pm EDT
but no clue how to convey tense

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:54pm EDT
i wonder if im allowed to use rubber bands rofl

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:55pm EDT
thata what i was thinking

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:55pm EDT
cause if you were allowed other materials

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 3:59pm EDT
sorry aint nobody got money for that

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:59pm EDT
What do you know about lines? Do you know vertical lines convey boundaries and seem more active? Do you know that a horizontal line conveys restfulness, stability, calm? And, do you know that vertical lines convey action or tension?

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 3:59pm EDT
hmm

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 4:00pm EDT
i might be able to get it for you for free

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 4:00pm EDT
OH!

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 4:00pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 4:00pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 4:00pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 4:02pm EDT
thats pretty great

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 4:02pm EDT
i thought so

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 4:02pm EDT
they gave us free antivirus software as well

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 4:02pm EDT
Do you know that shapes like triangles that have sharp points can convey tension between other shapes? Do you know that rounded shapes convey less tension?

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 4:02pm EDT
You create greater tension if you place objects near the corners or edges of the format Breaking the format creates more tension in the composition, also.

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 4:02pm EDT
im gonna try to draw something for you in ps real quick hold on

Nick Devlin October 14, 2012 at 4:03pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 4:09pm EDT
Steph Dudak October 14, 2012 at 4:09pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 5:45pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 5:50pm EDT
I'm hoping to find a way to bake cookies that don't make my teeth hurt

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 5:50pm EDT
Even like oatmeal raisin

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 5:50pm EDT
seriously?

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 5:50pm EDT
is it just cause the sugar in em or somethin or

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 5:50pm EDT
sugar

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 5:50pm EDT
at least i assume

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 5:51pm EDT
you could probably find recipes online that's really annoying though ):

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 5:51pm EDT
how do you eat cake tho isn't there sugar in that

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 5:51pm EDT
you eat a hell of a lotta cake

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 5:51pm EDT
sometimes it hurts

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 5:51pm EDT
sometimes it doesnt

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 5:52pm EDT
last night was the first time I've cake in about a month

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 5:52pm EDT
dayum

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 5:52pm EDT
ikr

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 5:52pm EDT
and cookies always hurt?

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 5:52pm EDT
almost always

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 5:52pm EDT
I mean like chips ahoy

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 5:52pm EDT
isnt that bad

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 5:52pm EDT
the chewy ones are bad

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 5:52pm EDT
but the normal one arent

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 5:52pm EDT
then again the normal ones taste like dust to me

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 5:54pm EDT
womp

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 5:54pm EDT
yup

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 5:54pm EDT
thats not fun

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 5:54pm EDT
what about

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 5:54pm EDT
I just bear through the pain someties though cookies are worth it

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 5:55pm EDT
macadamia nut cookies

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 5:55pm EDT
any sort of nut cookies

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 5:55pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 5:57pm EDT
mhm

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 5:57pm EDT
noms love macadamia nuts

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 5:57pm EDT

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 5:57pm EDT
I love those ones too

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 5:58pm EDT
When they are soft and warm

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 5:58pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:25pm EDT
ugh NIIICCCCKKKK

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:26pm EDT
Stepphphpphp

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:26pm EDT
thank goodness!

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:26pm EDT
have you done derivatives and all that

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:26pm EDT
with

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:26pm EDT
natural logs

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:26pm EDT
yes

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:26pm EDT
many times

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:26pm EDT
so

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
xlnx-x

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
please say you need help

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
YES

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
what s the derivative of that

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
because the answer i got

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
confused me i want to see if you get the same

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
did you use product rule and u substitution?

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
do i need to?

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
no

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
i am stupid

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
what im sayin is

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
xlnx

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
derivative of lnx is 1/x

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
yes

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
1/x * x = x/x = 1

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
derivative of x=1

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
1-1=0

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
you need product rule

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
for xlnx

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
?

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
x and ln(x) are being multiplied yeah

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
hmph

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
okie

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
so x * 1/x * ln(x) *1

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
that middle * is a +

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT
i know how to do it and everything

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT
i just i dont even know lol

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT
cause i treated it like

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT
if it said 2x^2 yk

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT
x as coefificient

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT
i gotchu

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT
i think...

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT
this shit is just confusing because the notation is stupid

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:31pm EDT
the constantly make us write everything out, but they can't be bothered to include a few parenthesis

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:31pm EDT
so 1+lnx = f'(x)?

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:31pm EDT
thats what i got

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
x/x=1 and ln(x)*1=ln(x)

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
and the -1 gets thrown out

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
well then how the hell do i do this problem

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
cause

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
i need to find

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
the intervals on which f(x) is increasing and decreasing

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
and local extrema

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
idk if youve done that yet?

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
owait there is a -x at the end, sis you turn that to 1?

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:33pm EDT
because then it just turns to ln9x)

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:33pm EDT
ln(x)

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:33pm EDT
the ones cancel out

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:33pm EDT
question still stands

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:34pm EDT
cause now im just left with lnx

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:34pm EDT
I've done things where we find out if the function is increasing or decreasing at a given point

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:34pm EDT
all real numbers as my answer??? idk!!

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:34pm EDT
exactly and theres nothing to do here and no regiions to test

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:34pm EDT
regions (

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:34pm EDT
***

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:37pm EDT
if they dont give a region...

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:37pm EDT
no its like

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:37pm EDT
oh wait

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:37pm EDT
can i set lnx equal to 0?

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:38pm EDT
yes

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:38pm EDT
but

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:38pm EDT
i mean

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:38pm EDT
that gives you where it is horizontal

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:38pm EDT
what makes that equal 0

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:38pm EDT
omg wait

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:38pm EDT
nvm hold on

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:38pm EDT
ln(1)=0?

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
derp yes

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
i forgot i had to set this equal to zero

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
then i forgot

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
lnx=y e^y=x

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
silly steph

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
thanks for your help nicholas

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
very

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
of course

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
you have no idea

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
how happy i am that I could help

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:40pm EDT
I finally am back up to par in math

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:40pm EDT
:D

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:41pm EDT
should i say that it does not decrease? or like

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:41pm EDT
cause

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:41pm EDT
it cant you cant take the natural log of 0 or a negative number

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:41pm EDT
so it increases (1, infinity)

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:41pm EDT
but doesnt decrease (-infinity, 1)

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:41pm EDT
ill say it dne

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:42pm EDT
good plan

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:42pm EDT
would x=1 be a local max or min or neither? still dont really know how that works honestly

Nick Devlin October 24, 2012 at 9:43pm EDT
never evven heard of it :(

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:43pm EDT
oooo okie

Steph Dudak October 24, 2012 at 9:46pm EDT

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:03pm EDT
i'm not hoping for that

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:03pm EDT
I know you aren't

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:03pm EDT
i'm just hoping for rain that will get me out of class and minimal to more hopefully no damage

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:03pm EDT
But no one adds that second part because they all forget

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:04pm EDT
that some people dont have homes that could withstand a storm that bad

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:04pm EDT

It's 10:30 now 10:27pm Steph Dudak obvi that didn't happen i wouldn't spend two hours on these models especially since the first one couldn't possibly take that long 10:29pm Brendan Gilmer Why the longest one would be the first since you don't know what your doing 10:29pm Steph Dudak because there isn't much to it? 10:29pm Brendan Gilmer The relief or the model? 10:30pm Steph Dudak the model 10:30pm Brendan Gilmer Oh that's right your doing Betty's super abstract idea 10:31pm Steph Dudak yep. 10:32pm Brendan Gilmer Your still a slacker 10:32pm Steph Dudak I know that that's exactly what i just said to you 10:33pm Brendan Gilmer Maybe you should let me in so I can help you 10:33pm Steph Dudak nah i don't need help 10:33pm Brendan Gilmer Come on I'm already up here 10:33pm Steph Dudak no 10:33pm Brendan Gilmer Yep Come on I'm bored 10:36pm Steph Dudak then maybe you should get the rest of your work done 10:38pm Brendan Gilmer Nope that would be work and I refuse to work on work until its time to work on work 10:38pm Steph Dudak yet you want to come in here while i'm doing mine? it's work time and then sleeps BYYEE 10:39pm Brendan Gilmer ...

THE END OF THE GIRLS HALLWAY ALL THAT'S THERE IS A WINDOW AND ONE OTHER ROOM

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:14pm EDT
i was thinking about how you said that

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:15pm EDT
creep status

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:15pm EDT
you got a not so secret admirer~

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:15pm EDT
i told rich and he was like NAH i knew he was a weirdo when we came back from dinner

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:15pm EDT
after we went out, we came back to my room and abbie decided

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:15pm EDT
SHE WAS GOING TO BED AT 8PM

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:16pm EDT
so i was like wow great um okay. so got changed and we hung out in the lounge for a little bit so she could get her ass to sleep and stuff

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:16pm EDT
and sure enough brendan was in there cause he like lives there on the other couch and we were there on my laptop just looking at dumb comics and videos and things

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:16pm EDT
and yeah that was awkward we ran into him when i opened the door to the hall when we came back too

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:17pm EDT
he's normal sometimes but most of the time

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:17pm EDT
he's creepy and pisses me off a lot

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:17pm EDT
like he thinks he's funny but when i'm literally telling him, shut the fuck up, you're being an asshole, i know i have to do this, then listen to me

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:17pm EDT
and don't be surprised that i'm getting pissed off

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:17pm EDT
i have a low tolerance for annoying people and it's not hard to make me mad LEAVE ME ALONE

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:18pm EDT
thats irritating

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:18pm EDT
extremely irritating

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:18pm EDT
when people are bothersome enough to annoy you and make you want to never talk to them again

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:19pm EDT
but dont do anything bad enough to warrant it

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:19pm EDT
just minimal creepiness/ annoyingness

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:19pm EDT
exactly

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:19pm EDT
hes annoying and he's distracting

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:19pm EDT
and especially needs to GO AWAY WHEN IM IN STUDIO

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:20pm EDT
because hes always like watch this look at this omg this is funny

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:20pm EDT
and like yeah

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:20pm EDT
sometimes it is

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:20pm EDT
BUT IM HERE BECAUSE I HAVE WORK TO GET DONE

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:20pm EDT
NOT TO DO NOTHING LIKE YOU LEAVE ME ALONE AND STOP TOUCHING EVERYTHING AROUND ME

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:26pm EDT
yeahhh

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:26pm EDT
I try to make people like that hate me

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:26pm EDT
but since I'm so awesome it never works

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:26pm EDT
ah well

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:26pm EDT
youd think he would amy and I only call him mommy pants/mommy

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:26pm EDT
but more ghetto like. it's more exaggerated like mami

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:26pm EDT
because one day

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:27pm EDT
amy, brandon, brendan, grace, and i were walking to the school store during design to get matte board and brendan like sprinted across the street at the 7 seconds left to cross so we all stood there

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:27pm EDT
and amy goes

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:27pm EDT
can we just talk about brendans mom pants he was wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt and may or may not have looked a little like a pregnant mother

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:28pm EDT
so while we were waiting for the ramvan brandon told brendan about the mom pants thing so that's what we call him now bc we don't like him

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:28pm EDT
and hes just like lolol yyyy faklgjfkhjdfkhljdahj

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:29pm EDT
youd think he would hate me right cause i'm easily irritated and dont ever address him by his real name

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:29pm EDT
but i guess not

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:29pm EDT
it shows an affectionate nick name

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:30pm EDT
meh

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:30pm EDT
he knows why we're calling him it though and he doesnt like it

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:30pm EDT
maybe he thinks it is 4th grade

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:30pm EDT
i think the problem

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:30pm EDT
is he doesnt have a lady friend And realy wants to get laid by SOMEONE SOMEWHERE so he just annoys everyone

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:31pm EDT
hahaha

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:32pm EDT
that seems to be a common problem

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:32pm EDT
and he isnt going about handling it very well

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:32pm EDT
not at all

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:32pm EDT
first of all ya know your kinda taken

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:32pm EDT
theres other girls that are single that he can bother ??? so

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:32pm EDT
he met rich.

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:32pm EDT
he MET him

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:33pm EDT
thats why i am bemused

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:33pm EDT
hes annoying to amy too, but not as much as he is to me. she's got a man too

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:33pm EDT
niggas gotta step off

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:33pm EDT
i've seen

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:33pm EDT
it was weird too one day

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:33pm EDT
i was in writing

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:33pm EDT
and it was the monday after rich was here i think

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
and brendan was like your boyfriend drives ALL the way down here to see you?

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
im like

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
uh

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
yeah

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
every other weekend we only live 1.5 hrs away

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
sometimes 2 sometimes 1

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
if he drives 500mph

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
like LEAVE

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:35pm EDT
thats unfortunate

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:35pm EDT
i'm really glad i'm not a girl

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:37pm EDT
its so stupid

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:37pm EDT
like i've heard every girl complain about this kind of crap

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:38pm EDT
cause boys are creepy more often than girls are i feel

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:38pm EDT
know what i mean

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:38pm EDT
i do

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:39pm EDT
especially since like every once in a while I think, oh god i was just super creepy fuck

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:39pm EDT
then never talk to that person again

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:39pm EDT
see but if youre creepy once and youre like shit and youre normal for the most part for the rest of forever then its fine

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:39pm EDT
but then you have people like brendan people like mark

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
I can understand that too

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
they think

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
fuck i was creepy

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
i have to keep talking to her

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
show her that i am not a creep

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
which obviously is not how you should go about talking to someone

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
orrrr

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
never realize it and you just are that way

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:41pm EDT
abbie told me she thought brendan was interested i said i just think hes lonely, not necessarily interested esp bc he knows rich exists but if he were, then i can say i only attract creepy people except for rich

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:41pm EDT
that was my other thought, every girl i know just attracts creepy people

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:41pm EDT
i suppose there's one normal one in all the mess

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:42pm EDT
that being

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:43pm EDT
is that a question

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:43pm EDT
:P

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:43pm EDT
jerk hahaha

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:43pm EDT
rich isn't creepy he's weird but it's an acceptable weird

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:44pm EDT
Maybe it's cause you are all rational human beings who don't judge much based on interests. So the weird people just think they have a chance and go for it incessantly

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:44pm EDT
not a "you need to leave right now" weird

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:44pm EDT
there are many variations

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:44pm EDT
like the cute weird and the awe inspiring weird

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:44pm EDT
gross weird

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:45pm EDT
uncomfortable weird

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:45pm EDT
funny weird

Steph Dudak October 27, 2012 at 3:45pm EDT
there is tons

Nick Devlin October 27, 2012 at 3:45pm EDT

Nick Devlin November 10, 2012 at 8:17pm EST
but if you get some spare time

Nick Devlin November 10, 2012 at 8:17pm EST
A small rush of accomplishment goes through me as I am able to grab all the clothes out of the dryer in one armful. I feel a small piece of cloth at my fingertips start slipping and my triumphant moment vanishes as it slides out of my grasp. I groan and reach in to grab the sock that fell back into the dryer. As I pick it up, I take a closer look at the sock and become even more exasperated. MOOM! Did you go clothes shopping?! praying that she would say yes. No, honey. Why? Did you find another sock? my mom answered from the other room. Yes! It doesnt even look close to like something wed wear!  Stop being so dramatic, just put it with the rest. Fine, I sigh, walking over to the sock room. There must be thousands of socks in shoddily organized piles. Why does Mom hoard them away in this room? None of them even fit on our feet, let alone match each other. I just fling in the sock into the room and shut the door behind me. Sometimes I really wish our socks just magically disappeared.

Nick Devlin November 10, 2012 at 8:17pm EST
any stupid checking or advice you have would be awesome

Steph Dudak November 10, 2012 at 9:17pm EST
AH DID NOT SEE READING NAO

Steph Dudak November 10, 2012 at 9:19pm EST
Can you make MOOM MOM instead? was that on purpose? If it was I just read it as "moom". ' close to like something' sounds awkward to me, personally don't need like in there sounds good nigga i dig it

Nick Devlin November 10, 2012 at 10:18pm EST

Nick Devlin November 10, 2012 at 10:18pm EST

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 5:33pm EST

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 5:33pm EST
it was painful. I want to buy the movie then watch it frame by frame

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 5:33pm EST
just to make sure i get them all

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 5:34pm EST
I think the konami code was my favourite

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 5:36pm EST
puns on puns too I WISH EGGMAN TALKED THOUGH IN THEIR LITTLE MEETING IK IT WASNT THAT SIGNIFICANT BUT FOR SOME REASON I JUST REALLY WANTED HIM TO TALK

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 5:36pm EST
oh the puns were wonderful

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 5:36pm EST
but yeah bowser didnt talk either

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 5:37pm EST
bowser never really actually talks though but at least he did something

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 5:37pm EST
true, i guess eggman didnt get much since sonic got to give the death outside of game speech

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 5:37pm EST
i'm glad the main focus wasn't on the cameos but it would've been fun if they were a little more involved Exactly! It was such a good movie though

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 5:38pm EST
ALTHOUGH i didn't feel like whole felix/calhoun romance was completely necessary

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 5:38pm EST
it was amusing

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 5:38pm EST
and it didnt take away from the plot

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 5:39pm EST
so i didnt mind

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 5:39pm EST
no it didn't but it felt a little rushed and could've gone without it not saying it's a bad thing they included it

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 5:40pm EST
super rushed, the laughing taffy scene was hilarious

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 5:40pm EST
and her character just amused me in general

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 5:44pm EST
indeed I like how she looks like jane lynch and vanellope looks like sarah silverman Good stuff good stuff

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 5:44pm EST
yup

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 5:45pm EST
just so many cool things

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 5:45pm EST
the animation of the citizens in ralphs game were pretty cool too

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 5:50pm EST
it was so great I'm pretty sure at some point in the movie i almost cried emotional MOVIE TICKETS ARE MORE EXPENSIVEHEREBTW

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 5:50pm EST

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 5:56pm EST

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 5:56pm EST

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 5:56pm EST
elevation burger Not the cheapest but yummy food

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 5:56pm EST
also worth it

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 5:56pm EST
thats good

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 5:57pm EST
i hate when expensive food doesnt even taste good

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 5:57pm EST
like at amusement parks

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 5:57pm EST
ugh

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 5:57pm EST
glad you enjoyed the food and the show

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 5:58pm EST
it was a bit over $20 for the both of us so i mean not crazy since it was two burgers, two things of fries, two drinks you know. But more expensive than five guys and you get hella food there so lol i feel you though it was nice! especially since we don't really go out or anything when rich comes here so it was fun. also the first time i met peter and he's very nice

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 5:58pm EST
good itd be awkward if he wasnt

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:00pm EST

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:00pm EST

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:01pm EST

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:01pm EST

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:01pm EST

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:02pm EST

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:38pm EST
lack of interest

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:38pm EST
extreme lack of interest

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:38pm EST
i don't want to do collages

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:38pm EST
1 because i hate morna

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:38pm EST
2 because i hate collages

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:39pm EST
3 because i know she'll hate them either way

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:40pm EST
i make all my projects stuff I either already know about therefore can finsih in like ten minutes or stuff I really wanna know about and will look up even if I wasnt in class

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:40pm EST
i'm guessing there no way to do that for your project though

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:41pm EST
okay i have three collages. one i need to use stupid leaves and paper because that was class the other two have to relate to each other

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:41pm EST
i also have 0 magazines at hand or anything fun like that sooooooooooooooooooooooo

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:42pm EST
annoying

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:42pm EST
just go to a doctors office and steal some

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:42pm EST
yeah brb let me go do that

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:42pm EST
everyone has phones now anyway

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:42pm EST
glad to help :)

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:42pm EST
-.-

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:43pm EST
yeah idk

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:43pm EST
printing offline?

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:43pm EST
need to go to library and can only print black and white

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:43pm EST
because color costs money and i have none of that

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:44pm EST
maybe you could be all artsy and make the collage black and white

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:44pm EST
to show how imaginitive you is

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:44pm EST
she'll hate and tell me the composition is bad and then ask me why everything is black and white

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:44pm EST
true

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:45pm EST
she basically told amy the other day "YELLOW HURTS YOUR EYES YOU ARE BAD"

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:45pm EST
she had this yellow in her collage with the leaves, and it wouldn't hurt any normal persons eyes and morna was like

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:45pm EST
doesnt that hurt your eyes

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:45pm EST
and amy's like no

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:45pm EST
...

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:45pm EST
and mornas like YES IT DOES

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:45pm EST
and cAUSE UR OLD AS SHIT AND BLIND AS A BAT SHUT UP

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:46pm EST
THATS WHY IT HURTS YOUR EYES JUST QUIT TEACHING BC YOU SUCK

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:46pm EST
so youre saying she'll hate it no matter what you do

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:46pm EST
why not just do black and white then

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:46pm EST
or does the degree in which she hates it matter

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:49pm EST
it does cause i want it to look good I don't care what she wants necessarily, like i don't want to do black and white because i wouldn't like it myself. boring. i like color. i actually liked the last collage i did and i'm pretty sure she hated it with a passion But i'm at the point where i'm doing what i want because no matter what i do i'm going to get a not so desirable grade on it

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:49pm EST
thats good

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:49pm EST
I'm glad you are doing that

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:49pm EST
How did you do the last collage?

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:50pm EST
it was like 98% things i made hold on let me try to send you a picture

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:50pm EST
i was wondering if you were allowed to do that

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:50pm EST
just makes a bunch of your own pics to use

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:52pm EST
it was also partially because no magazines so yolo but i had previous art things i was able to use but see now these two collages need to relate to each other and idk what to do

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:52pm EST
relate how? like design-wise or concept wise

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:53pm EST
idk that's all she said

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:54pm EST
So like 2 different collages about penguins with different styles could work?

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:54pm EST
that'd be amusing

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:54pm EST
yes lol but i'm not jewels

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:54pm EST
first thing that came to mind

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:54pm EST
do a collage of shoes

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:54pm EST
with a fox in the corner

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:54pm EST
hahaha

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:55pm EST
then the second collage is just rich's face everywhere

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:55pm EST
oh my goodness

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:55pm EST
and the relate because they both are parts of the story

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:55pm EST
the wonderful beautiful story

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 6:56pm EST
that would be something

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:57pm EST
it would be awesome

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:57pm EST
or you could do like a before and after

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:57pm EST
since i just thought of seaside

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:57pm EST
pictures from before collage

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:57pm EST
pictures after collage

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 6:58pm EST
itd be sad, but it could work if you could find pics

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:08pm EST
i don't have time for that

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:08pm EST
because i'd need to go over to the library and print them and theyd be black and white

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:08pm EST
this is due tomorrow

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:09pm EST
yeah, sometimes my genius cannot be made

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:09pm EST
ummm

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:09pm EST
idk then

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:11pm EST
if you cant use then internet or any magazines

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:11pm EST
there isnt much I can think of

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:11pm EST
TECHNICALLY i dont need to have these done til end of semester when portfolios are due

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
since i only see morna tomorrow

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:12pm EST

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
and then give her the others after break

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:12pm EST

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:12pm EST

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
OKAY TIME TO DO MY PAPER AND I CAN COLLAGE WHILE SKYPING UGH

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:12pm EST

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
but

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
yeah

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
i have an ice pop which is not nearly as satisfying

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:13pm EST
which reminds me

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:13pm EST
of

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:13pm EST
why didn't the rooster cross the road?

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:13pm EST
umm

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:14pm EST
cause he was chicken

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:14pm EST
I just stared at the screen

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:14pm EST
and made an almost laugh

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:14pm EST
but not really

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
and i didnt know what to d

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
it was on my ice pop stick the other day

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
yup

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
i had the same reaction

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
yeah i wish i had some kind of rational response to that

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:16pm EST
ill let you know what the joke is when i finish this one

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:17pm EST
what happened when the shark became famous?

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:17pm EST
these are really bad jokes. like not good bad

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:17pm EST
he became a starfish

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:18pm EST
that

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:18pm EST
made no sense

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:18pm EST
at all

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:18pm EST
but it did

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:18pm EST
that must be the worst job

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:18pm EST
sharks are fish famous = star famous shark = star fish

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:18pm EST
starfish

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:40pm EST
Graffiti is an art form used to express culture, emotion, and politics. While graffiti is often seen as a nuisance, messy, or useless, it invokes specific feelings in people which is exactly what art does. or something like that, any input to fix that is fine too but the quote: Art is anything you can get away with.

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:41pm EST
hmmm

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:41pm EST
gimme a sec

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:41pm EST
or a min

you're perfect

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:47pm EST
np

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:47pm EST
i like editing

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:48pm EST
alright so after that

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:48pm EST
i had a plan to introduce traditional definition of graffiti then came in banksy cause how can i write a paper about graffiti and not mention banksy

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:49pm EST
that is true

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:49pm EST
however

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:49pm EST
the bulk of this paper has to be about graffiti and philadelphia

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:49pm EST
now

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:49pm EST
the good thing is, i do have this little bit of information in a separate paragraph

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:49pm EST
The birthplace of graffiti in the United States is said to have been in Philadelphia in the 1960s. Well known in Philadelphia is Cornbread, born Darryl McCray, who is often referred to as the father of modern graffiti writing and refers to himself as a graffiti writer. He is mostly known for signing Cornbread in various places including the Jackson 5s private jet and on an elephant in the Philadelphia Zoo. *INSERT MORE INFORMATION AND STUFF HERE BEFORE TRANSITIONING INTO NEXT* But graffiti in Philadelphia has since developed and grown and the city is now filled with traditional graffiti to beautiful large scale murals.

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:51pm EST
but i do feel like i'm kind of contradicting myself

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:51pm EST
cause i want to make the argument more graffiti has grown into art from these scribbles and such

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:51pm EST
but they are the basis for it

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:52pm EST
hmm

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:52pm EST
relate the growth of graffiti to another art form

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:52pm EST
that was once possibly seen as silly

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:52pm EST
into something that is respected

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:53pm EST
maybe animation?

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:53pm EST
or something else?

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:53pm EST
i'm not too into art histyory but there must be something

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:55pm EST
well i mean i can still do that without comparing it but i can do that too cause its like writing>more complex "writing" such as http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_jiLsBLaOvzE/S-ZnJu1PhzI/AAAAAAAAG9Y/x7eoi8MKAmc/s1600/ABC+alphabet+graffiti+style+cool.jpg to then pictures to then murals bc philadelphia and hella murals

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:56pm EST
that is true

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:56pm EST
and the murals i mean they have tours of those and theyre used as educational things

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 7:57pm EST
hmm so which part do you think is contradictory

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:59pm EST
hm well I dont know because i dont really consider just signing your name somewhere with spraypaint art but it helped develop what ugh how do i write i'm going to send you everything i have written right now. it's not much and it's all over the place

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 7:59pm EST
and i dont think in order either idk which to talk about first but i feel like banksy and then philly idk anyway

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:00pm EST
using your intro; Graffiti is an art form that can be used to express culture, emotion, and political views. While graffiti is often seen as a nuisance, ugly, or even offensive, it does invoke feelings in people, which is exactly what art does. Andy Warhol, a pioneer in unconventional art, has said that Art is anything you can get away with. Graffiti is usually defined as writings or drawings scribbled or spray painted illicitly onto a wall or other surfaces in public areas which is why it is usually seen as nothing more than vandalism. The artists creating the graffiti are often associated with gangs, violence, or bad neighborhoods. However, this is a common misconception of graffiti artists. In fact, only a small portion of graffiti is done by gangs and such is strictly used for marking terrainit has no style and is not meant to put forth anything else. So how can one possibly consider graffiti art? A good example is the British graffiti artist, or street artist, Banksy. He started off in England by writing and stenciling around various places and has since had multiple solo gallery shows and published five books of his art and writing. Banksy is a prime example of how graffiti can be much more than something scribbled onto a wall. Much of his work is satirical and involves political or social commentary often stenciled onto walls. One of his works, Girl with Heart Balloon features a little girl next to a heart shaped red balloon that appears to be floating away from her. While it may have an apparent meaning, it can be interpreted in a variety of ways. One of the more literal meanings would be she is letting her heart go, while another may be she is reaching to get back something that has fallen from her grasp. Another work, The Crayola Shooter depicts a young boy holding a machine gun with crayons as the ammunition surrounded by flowers, grass, and a sun with a smiley facesomething it seems a little kid would create. A third work of his, simple text on a wall that reads Sorry! The lifestyle you ordered is out currently of stock, seems to be a sarcastic comment on consumer culture. While Banksy is one of the more famous graffiti artists and does make specific commentary through his pieces, the same ideals are used by other graffiti artists in other places such as Philadelphia. The birthplace of graffiti in the United States is said to have been in Philadelphia in the 1960s. Well known in Philadelphia is Cornbread, born Darryl McCray, who is often referred to as the father of modern graffiti writing and refers to himself as a graffiti writer.

I am reading

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:02pm EST
If you are just waiting for me to go over you can entertain yourself by stupid checking my first paragrapg :D

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:02pm EST
Dragon. When people hear that word what is the first thing that comes to mind? Depending on where you live or what you know the answer could be very different. In Asian countries the Chinese Dragon may first pop into someones mind; the long, curvy, serpentine animal that appears so often. However in western culture the monstrous, fire-breathing European Dragon is more widely recognized. Dragons have been a prevalent mythical creature for centuries, perhaps millennia, and they are still popular today, showing up in books like Harry Potter, the Lord of the Rings, and The Dragonriders of Pern. It might stand out that all of these popular stories contain allusions to European dragons, which makes sense as they were all written by Western authors. However it is plain to see by some of the festivals, architecture, and designs in Asian countries that the Chinese dragon is still popular today.

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
if you're going to use second person in the third sentence, i'd use it in the second as well it'll flow nicer. "When YOU hear that word what is the first thing that comes to mind? Depending on where you live or what you know the answer could be very different." does western always need to be capitalized? if so, capitalize "However in Western culture etc" if not, ignore

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
it always should be capitilized yeah

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:11pm EST
I think you talk about bansky a bit much

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:11pm EST
it doesnt relate to philly much

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:11pm EST
that's just cause i have no other information yet lol

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:11pm EST
gotcha

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:11pm EST
that was just the easiest to write about

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:11pm EST
i'd say try to find philly art work to disect if you can

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
cause i have the beginnings of the beginning of graffiti in philadelphia yeah that's what imma try now bc i tried looking for specific artists but nope

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
yeah I gotchu

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:13pm EST
you could be a super cool tryhard and go out and find a cool mural, take a pic and include in the essay then explain its meaning

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:14pm EST
i probably wouldn't need to actually go out to find one but i think he may have suggested that at our meaning I really shouldve written down what we discussed because it was thursday and i had gotten no sleep and still had design on my brain all day

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:14pm EST
meeting*

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:16pm EST
usually helpful to write things

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:16pm EST
here is what i fixed

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:16pm EST

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:20pm EST
can i ask why you changed illicitly to illegally

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:21pm EST
different connotation

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:21pm EST
didnt seem to match your tone to me

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:21pm EST
i could be wrong

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:21pm EST
its just a personal preference

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:35pm EST
well now i have an issue

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:36pm EST
unfun

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:36pm EST
http://muralarts.org/about/history The Anti-Graffiti Network hired muralist Jane Golden to reach out to graffiti writers and to redirect their energies from destructive graffiti writing to constructive mural painting.

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:39pm EST
the issue is

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:40pm EST
i dont think there is one But ii need to be more specific

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:41pm EST
specific is usually better than general

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:42pm EST
i mean i'm making the argument that graffiti is art okay but scribbles isn't necessarily art

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:42pm EST
but it has grown from that scribbles>hard as fuck to do writing>pictures>murals examples of all

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:43pm EST
mural arts program developed to rid the city of destructive graffiti, helping artists channel their creativity and skill into something larger more impacting and beautiful

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:43pm EST
thus mofukkin murals out the ass

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:43pm EST
thus defining factor of philadelphia

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:43pm EST
as "city of murals"

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:44pm EST
inspiring people and artists of many kinds

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:44pm EST
yes

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:44pm EST
seems logical to me

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:45pm EST
alright but then i have that intro

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:46pm EST
Graffiti is an art form that can be used to express culture, emotion, and political views. [[While graffiti is often seen as a nuisance, ugly, or even offensive, it does invoke feelings in people, which is exactly what art does. Andy Warhol, a pioneer in unconventional art, has said that Art is anything you can get away with.]] that goes for ALL graffiti but i'm not considering ALL graffiti art (scribbles) omg what am i doing

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
all right, your problem is defining exactly what constitutes graffiti art

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
you cannot exclude the tagging of names and 'scribbles'

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
that is the foundation of graffiti

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
it may not be good

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
it may not be appreciated

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
but it is still ary

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
art*

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:48pm EST
true then the next problem comes into this sentence or few Graffiti is usually defined as markings scribbled or spray-painted illegally onto a wall or other surface in public areas, which is why it is usually seen as nothing more than vandalism. The people creating the graffiti are associated with gangs, violence, and bad neighborhoods. However, this is a common misconception of graffiti artists. In fact, only a small portion of graffiti is done by gangs and it is strictly used for marking terrainit has no style and is not meant to be artistic.

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:49pm EST
scribbles

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:51pm EST
Although this portion of the art form may be obtrusive and unwelcome, it is not all that graffiti has to offer

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:51pm EST
just like all things it has its negative users, which should be used to stereotype the art itself

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:52pm EST
kjGSkfg thank you for helping me

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:53pm EST
of course

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:54pm EST
okay now to find more complex writing pieces to transition out of Cornbread i wish i could find a specific artists

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:54pm EST
-s why can't i type lately oh my goodness

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:55pm EST
well graffiti is sort of anonymous isnt it?

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:55pm EST
i mean most people use pseudonyms

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:56pm EST
the artists are very imprtant so it 'd be better just to find famous works

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:56pm EST
arent*

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:56pm EST
no i know but it makes it easier to reference them

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:56pm EST
true

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:56pm EST
like with banksy actual art

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:56pm EST
na mean

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:56pm EST
I know, but it would be good to show something anyone would assume at firs tglance isnt art

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:57pm EST
then explain why it is

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:57pm EST
hm. i should've asked him if i'm allowed to include pictures in this paper

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:57pm EST
i don't see why i wouldn't be

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:57pm EST
i could have a reference sheet

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:57pm EST
to the picture so it's not right in the essay

Steph Dudak November 18, 2012 at 8:57pm EST
after all my sources

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:57pm EST
its about art, it'd make less sense not to have pictures

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:58pm EST
my english teacher always wants us to include youtube links and pictures and cool sources

Nick Devlin November 18, 2012 at 8:58pm EST

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 1:55pm EST
it's probably real bad writing since went back to workin on it late

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 1:57pm EST
tis fine

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 1:57pm EST
While Banksy is one of the more famous graffiti artists and does make specific commentary through his pieces, the same ideals are used by other graffiti artists in other places such as Philadelphia.

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 1:57pm EST
you sound like you are about to contradict something

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 1:57pm EST
then dont

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 1:57pm EST
i shouldnt say while

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 1:57pm EST
basically

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 1:58pm EST
after pieces put and in philadelphia take out other places such as

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 1:58pm EST
since philly is the main focus

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 1:58pm EST
see ya dont even need me

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 1:58pm EST
yes i do pls read the rest lol

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 1:59pm EST
While it can be easy to make out what it says, sometimes it is more difficult and leaves the viewer looking at it longer in an attempt to decipher what the painting really means.

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 1:59pm EST
While it can *occasionally* be

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:00pm EST
i feel like this section doesn't have enough real information

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:00pm EST
but i need to then transition from all that into the murals

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:00pm EST
hmm

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:02pm EST
the last paragraph is missing

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:02pm EST
also this sentence

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:02pm EST
Or perhaps all of these questions are invalid, which can be applied to any work of art.

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:02pm EST
is not useful and can be cut

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:02pm EST
or you need to better explain the idea

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:02pm EST
word

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:02pm EST
Not only are they interesting but they make comments and meanings and ideas can be pulled out of them just by looking at them. and the city is now filled with everything from traditional graffiti to beautiful large-scale murals.

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:03pm EST
this is what is going on in my word document

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:03pm EST
yep

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:03pm EST
ah you wish to fill that space?

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:03pm EST
that's unfinished stuff that is a sentence i had in there that i mightve wanted to keep not sure

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:03pm EST
but yes that space does need to be filled some more

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:04pm EST
gotcha

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:05pm EST
but overall its cool

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:05pm EST
the bansky stuff doesnt seem as much now that you have added a little to the overall stuff

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:05pm EST
have you googled random philly murals yet?

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:05pm EST
i have a website

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:05pm EST
hold on

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:05pm EST
awesome

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:06pm EST
http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1649278,00.html#ixzz2Cczt47kb

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:06pm EST
i just need to find a way to transition into the murals cause i do need to talk about the mural arts program thing

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:06pm EST
i think that bottom sentence is gonna be part of my closing

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:06pm EST
im just not sure if i have enough about all the other stuff i have in there rn

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:08pm EST
move you last sentence

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:08pm EST
Not only are they interesting but they make comments and meanings and ideas can be pulled out of them just by looking at them.

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:08pm EST
to your second to last sentence

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:08pm EST
and then you have a fine transition into murals

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:12pm EST
only thing is

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:12pm EST
i used that second to last sentence to talk about like like the example i have to the left

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:12pm EST
not quite mural yet

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:12pm EST
but not just writing graffiti

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:12pm EST
which is how you transition from griffiti to mural...?

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:13pm EST
the in between stage

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:13pm EST
what i'm saying is

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:16pm EST
Thus throughout the years graffiti continued to develop and we begin to see actual images in works of graffiti. Not only are they interesting but they make comments and meanings and ideas can be pulled out of them just by looking at them that is about the inbetween. like it's about that example on the left. it's not really a mural right now, but it's not just writing graffiti. it's grown into that and from there murals. but i guess icould still get away with switching those last two sentences

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:17pm EST
that is what i am saying. The two ideas are connected but the first idea of including pictures transitions well into introducing the ide of murals

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:18pm EST
got it

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:18pm EST
alright

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:18pm EST
so

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:18pm EST
well then i need to talk about the mural arts program thing

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:18pm EST
so i have those two sentences

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:18pm EST
new paragraph

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:19pm EST
yup

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:19pm EST
because of the amount of graffiti

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:20pm EST
large amount of graffiti

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:20pm EST
as well as destructive graffiti writing

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:21pm EST
http://muralarts.org/about/history the mural arts program began as an attempt to redirect the abilities of graffiti artists into constructive mural painting

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:24pm EST
so

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:24pm EST
people who disliked the problem of grafitti noticed the potential it had to be pretty

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:24pm EST
based on some of the more artistic scribblings

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:24pm EST
and thus tried to create a solution with that

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:26pm EST
essentially

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:27pm EST
Because of the large amount of graffiti around Philadelphia, the Mural Arts Program was established as an attempt to redirect the creative abilities of graffiti artists from what they believed was destructive into constructive mural painting. It was obvious that these people had immense creative talent and the program was a way to make that into something bigger that also adds to communities and the city of Philadelphia as a whole. The creation of these murals changed lives as well as helped bring beauty and life to the city. Over 3,000 murals have been produced since the program began, giving Philadelphia the title of City of Murals.

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:28pm EST
bam

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:28pm EST
just clean up some sentences and it sounds awesome to me

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:29pm EST
okay also

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:29pm EST
i have a specific mural to add into that

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:29pm EST
cause the whole changing lives thing

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:29pm EST
and a quote

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:29pm EST
bam

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:30pm EST
http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1649278_1421197,00.html Hopefully that takes you to it

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:30pm EST
we're like freakin chefs making beutiful food with this badass writing

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:30pm EST
dam nthat murals intense, even has the whole thing where is stnads out by going outside its borders

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:33pm EST
shits cray

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:33pm EST
okay

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:33pm EST
so

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:34pm EST
picture has been included too bad i can't print in color ): Because of the large amount of graffiti around Philadelphia, the Mural Arts Program was established as an attempt to redirect the creative abilities of graffiti artists from what they believed was destructive into constructive mural painting. It was obvious that these people had immense creative talent and the program was a way to make that into something bigger that also adds to communities and the city of Philadelphia as a whole. The creation of these murals changed lives as well as helped bring beauty and life to the city. Over 3,000 murals have been produced since the program began, giving Philadelphia the title of City of Murals. One mural entitled Reaching for a Star by Don Gensler is featured on the side of a house. A resident, William Hodges, comments on the mural saying That mural is the best thing thats happened around here. For 20 years, this neighborhoods been going down, but when they came and put that mural up there on the wall, it stopped it from going down showing how truly impacting these murals are. help cleaning ?? AND THEN CONCLUSION!!??

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:35pm EST
alright cleaning first

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:35pm EST
then hopefully we'll think of a conclusion by the time we're done

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:36pm EST
Because of the large amount of graffiti around Philadelphia

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:36pm EST
Say some sentence that shows there is a lot of grafitti not that tells you

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:37pm EST
Since this is a research paper instead of flowery language

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:37pm EST
you should use

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:37pm EST
a fact or somethings

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:37pm EST
Due to graffiti coverering x amount of public grounds

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:38pm EST
true i will admit i was taking it from this The Mural Arts Program began in 1984 as a component of the Philadelphia Anti-Graffiti Network, an effort spearheaded by then Mayor Wilson Goode to eradicate the graffiti crisis plaguing the city. The Anti-Graffiti Network hired muralist Jane Golden to reach out to graffiti writers and to redirect their energies from destructive graffiti writing to constructive mural painting.

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:38pm EST
thats fine, you are paraphrasing

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:41pm EST
ugh i need to properly cite these sources

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:41pm EST
yup

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:41pm EST
i got a citation book next to me if you ned specific help, but I'mm sure you''l be fine

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:42pm EST
i can't get any numbers as far as the city being covered goes

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:42pm EST
i have numbers of murals

Nick Devlin November 19, 2012 at 2:43pm EST
thats fine i was just giving an example

Steph Dudak November 19, 2012 at 2:43pm EST

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 9:56pm EST

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 9:56pm EST
at one part

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 9:56pm EST
UGH OKAY SO I THINK MY LIGHT PROJECT IS TOO SIMPLE

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 9:57pm EST
:/

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 9:57pm EST
http://origamiaday.wordpress.com/2011/12/24/sea-urchin-star/ it's essentially this but with punctures

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 9:57pm EST
in it

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 9:57pm EST
thats hmmm cool

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 9:57pm EST
and the way it's made, there are little triangles of spaces at the bottom of each piece on the inside that i was CONSIDERING covering with like colored cellophane but idk BUT I THINK THIS IS TOO SIMPLE OF A THING

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 9:58pm EST
the one thing is it'll make some cool shadows

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 9:58pm EST
I always thought simple was better

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 9:58pm EST
for design

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 9:58pm EST
wrong

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 9:58pm EST
lol

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 9:58pm EST
well not necessarily wrong

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 9:58pm EST
more like

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 9:58pm EST
not always?

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 9:58pm EST
i need to compare myself to other students and there will be more complex ones that if they work I get a B on my project

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 9:58pm EST
because it's seen as "playing it safe"

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 9:59pm EST
which i think is ridiculous. NOT WHAT IM TRYING TO DO WITH THIS I JUST WANT TO DO SOMETHING GEOMETRICAL

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 9:59pm EST
playing it safe?

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 9:59pm EST
hmmm

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 9:59pm EST

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 9:59pm EST

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:06pm EST
i would love to have a result similar to this but maybe when the object is turned, there's a different effect

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:06pm EST
its like the twilight turtle i gave sara

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:07pm EST

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
making the holes into actual designs might help?

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
aw cute!

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
or are you already doing that

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
well that's the thing idk about that

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
but

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
i was considering different shapes

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
mhm

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
like triangles and things

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:08pm EST
that could help

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
different shapes on differnt things

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
when you turn it

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
thats cool

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
sometimes triangles sometimes other things

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
i just dont want it to look cheesy

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
like i dont want it to look like a nightlight

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
do you know how to make the light not be all blurry?

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
what do you mean

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
like how far the shade needs to be from the source

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
if it is too close the light will blur

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
and there will be no design

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
too far and the same problem hapens

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
well the only issue

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
is

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
the light is going to be inside that shape

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
WHICH IS ANOTHER THING

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
I FEEL LIKE ITLL BE A FIRE HAZARD

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
what kind of bulb?

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
for my study model, i dont think we need to use a light, but im putting those little fake tealights in it

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
just because i have them off hand

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
idk yet!

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
almost all bulbs nowadays arent fire hazards

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:12pm EST
expecially the twisty ones

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:12pm EST
the eco friendly things

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:12pm EST
well i mean

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:12pm EST
because paper is around it

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:12pm EST
the thing is made of paper

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:13pm EST
the spontaneous combustion threshhold is from like 400-500 degrees fahrenheit

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:13pm EST
O think you are fine

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:13pm EST
no lightbulb will heat the paper enough to cause a problem

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:13pm EST
and if something else makes a fire

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:13pm EST
well it doesnt really matter what the shade is made of

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:14pm EST
you have bigger problems

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:14pm EST
gotchu

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:14pm EST
so

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:14pm EST
but 3 inches away from the bulb

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:14pm EST
is good

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:14pm EST
yeah im just trynna think of how i can execute this without her being "lol simple"

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:15pm EST
i like the idea of cool paper thing that seems simple

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:15pm EST
but creates complex shadow design

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:15pm EST
THATS ANOTHER THING OKAY

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:15pm EST
but i am not her

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:15pm EST
cause

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:15pm EST
she was like

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:15pm EST
think about

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:15pm EST
what if it looks different when lights are on than when the lights are off

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:15pm EST
thats why im trynna think of how i make these ~punctures

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:16pm EST
i'm not sure i understand

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:17pm EST
i dont want giant obvious holes

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:17pm EST
i understand that

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
THATS witjaegj

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
okay

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
okay I WANT TO TRY the cellopahne thing

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
cellophane

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
i was gonna ask that next

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
i dont have any cellophane but i have plastic i can color and tape in the inside

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
it works for a study model i attempted it already

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:19pm EST
you could just like use sharpie on some scotch tape

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:19pm EST
ghetto arts and crafts

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:19pm EST
i dont have any transparent scotch tape though

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:19pm EST
that does sound problematic

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:19pm EST
but i was just joking

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
i was gonna use the plastic bag they put my bristol in at the school store lol

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
its even more ghetto actually

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
yeah coloring the lights sounds cool

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
all stretchy and shit

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
SHOULD I DO MORE THAN ONE COLOR

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
RED ORANGE AND YELLOW

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
youd have to test

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
i would

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
just to make sure they dont look awful

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
exactly

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
i dont wanna over do it

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
but i like warm colors like that

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
and make it ratchet

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
same

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
thats why

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
we'll see

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:21pm EST
i feel like blues and greens are way too difficult

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:21pm EST
like they would barely be visible

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:21pm EST
so yeah yellows and reds

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:21pm EST
imma test them too

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:21pm EST
though

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:21pm EST
cause im using white paper

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:21pm EST
who knows, might look awesome

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:21pm EST
do some rainbow shit

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:22pm EST
its be awesome if you had access to prisms

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:22pm EST
the only problem would be the light source would have to be very specific

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:22pm EST
i considered that

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:22pm EST
only works with white light

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:22pm EST
when i had to think of ideas

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:22pm EST
because

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:22pm EST
hol don

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:22pm EST
hold *

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:22pm EST
on

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:22pm EST
hol donning

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:23pm EST
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9bixwUdeo1ra5qn3o1_500.jpg

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:23pm EST
i was thinking of stuff like that

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:23pm EST
then i thought of multiple prisms

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:23pm EST
and mirrors

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:23pm EST
0.o shit that pic was awesome

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:24pm EST
i have no clue how youd integrate them into the piece

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:24pm EST
but it sounds cool

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:24pm EST
the only problem with that is i don't know what i would've wanted the shadow to be yeah idk then i was considering

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:24pm EST
making this shape

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:24pm EST
with some sort of plexi and then i was thinking

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:24pm EST
what would happen if there were like mirrors inside it

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:24pm EST
would anything happen if that

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:24pm EST
id have no way of testing

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:25pm EST
that would take a lot of fidgeting

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:25pm EST
finessing

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:25pm EST
wahtever

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:26pm EST
anyways

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:29pm EST
itd probably be helpful

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:29pm EST
if i had like

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:29pm EST
origami paper

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:29pm EST
but of course i didnt try to invest in any over the break

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:30pm EST
i doubt thatd be a priority when getting supplies

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:31pm EST
itd have been helpful

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:31pm EST
that it would

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:32pm EST
6/30 pieces of paper cut out

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:32pm EST
24 to go

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:32pm EST
thats like 20%!

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:32pm EST
you got this

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:34pm EST
also would be easier to fold i think since it's kind of made for that kinda thing

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:34pm EST
hopefully i can flawlessly make this work though lolol

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:35pm EST
origami paper is known for folding i suppose

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:37pm EST
yeah currently using printer paper lol

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:38pm EST
not as bad as it could be

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:38pm EST
just use a pencil or straightedge or something to crease and you'll be fine

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:38pm EST
my points arent pointy

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
:/

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
hmm

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
put something on the tips

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
it will make the thing more complex

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:40pm EST
and cover up the nonpointy tips

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:41pm EST
i have to fold on the diagonal of a rectangle

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:42pm EST
what do you mean

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
like this sorta

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
but better obviously

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
put a shape on the tips

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
that will have smoother lines

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
and doesnt look stupid

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
i just picked some random shapes

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
it was just an idea

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
the second one i folded came out better

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
good

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:47pm EST
28 more of those to go! lol

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:47pm EST
my brother and sister make me so mad

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:47pm EST
i knew something was missing from my task bar

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:47pm EST
idk why when they use my computer they feel the need to rearrange things

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:48pm EST
wow

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:48pm EST
to be pests

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:48pm EST
somehow skype managed to vanish

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
that doesnt even make sense

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
stupid sibling

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
thats what i get for being a nice sister and letting them play wow

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
basically

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 11:10pm EST

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 11:12pm EST

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 11:16pm EST
that's what i'm saying

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 11:16pm EST
he's like "honestly you could get me anything and i'm sure i'd be happy with it"

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 11:17pm EST

you are such a good help nicholas

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 11:21pm EST

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 11:21pm EST
you can draw like josh in the corner as kirby or something

Nick Devlin November 26, 2012 at 11:23pm EST
the possibilities are endless

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 11:23pm EST
the only thing is i'd need to practice a little bit because i can't draw people of course video game characters are a bit different but still difficult a little bit

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 11:24pm EST
ehe i could use melee or double dash

Steph Dudak November 26, 2012 at 11:24pm EST
AW

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 12:29pm EST
yeah id suggest utrecht though if you find nothing at michaels cause our michaels sucks

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:29pm EST
i shall put it in my list of things

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 12:29pm EST
they got all kinds of stuff

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 12:29pm EST
itd look nice if you mitered the edges haha

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 12:30pm EST
dunno if youd be able to

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:30pm EST
like when i join the wood

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 12:30pm EST
yes

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:30pm EST
i should be able to

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:31pm EST
i was thinking a lot about how to join

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:31pm EST
the wood together

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 12:31pm EST
mitering will be good, and it'll look nice. also if you can find loctite anywhere, it's a certain glue. the control gel is real awesome holds wood together pretty well

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 12:31pm EST
otherwise you know. wood glue and shit

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:32pm EST
hmmm

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:33pm EST
this is mitering right>?

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:33pm EST
angling the edges of wood

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:33pm EST
so they fit nice

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 12:33pm EST
yep!

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 12:33pm EST
45 degree angles

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:34pm EST
well they couldnt be 45

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:34pm EST
otherwise they wouldnt fit together

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:34pm EST
but yeah

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:34pm EST
that is what i thought

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 12:34pm EST
yeah they would

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 12:35pm EST
why wouldnt they fit

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 12:35pm EST
oh

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 12:35pm EST
would it not make that shape then

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:35pm EST
yeah

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 12:35pm EST
yeah derp

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:35pm EST
45 degrees makes a box

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 12:35pm EST
well you know

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:35pm EST
i know

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 12:35pm EST
you're smart you'll figure it out

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 12:36pm EST
wait

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:36pm EST
already trying, I wish I had a writing utensil, i need to draw this stuff out without a computer

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:36pm EST
waiting

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 12:36pm EST
your thing is drawn with 45 degree angles tho ?

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:36pm EST
nope

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:36pm EST
i tried 45 it looked odd

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 12:36pm EST
merh

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:38pm EST
actually

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:38pm EST
its not that bad

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:38pm EST
and it would make life much easier

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:38pm EST
especially with calculations

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:39pm EST
fuck it, i'm making a ton of 90 and 135 angles

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:40pm EST
holy shit look how awesome this is

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:40pm EST
http://www.woodworkingtips.com/etips/etip010511sn.html

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 12:43pm EST
that is awesome

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:46pm EST
so many ideas

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:46pm EST
it wouldnt really help much for my project though

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:47pm EST
the mitered area is too small

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:47pm EST
it'd be like 1/4 of an inch

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:47pm EST
maybe 1/2

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:47pm EST
aither way

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 12:48pm EST
what do you mean

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:49pm EST
the area where the boards connect

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:49pm EST
is too small for a spline to be worth it

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 12:50pm EST
a might just end up sawing all the way through

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 8:16pm EST
NICK

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 8:17pm EST
AHSJHGADJKG WHERE IS YOU

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 8:17pm EST
right here :D

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 8:17pm EST
alright so

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 8:17pm EST
there's a new plan for my design project no clue how im going to do it

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 8:17pm EST
i cannot do this star because it has 20 points and i need to like carve it into cardboard essentially

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 8:17pm EST
and its too much

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 8:18pm EST
mhmm

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 8:18pm EST
then i found like a 12 pointed star but its not as 3s

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 8:18pm EST
3d

Steph Dudak November 27, 2012 at 8:18pm EST
can you get on skype so i can show you

Nick Devlin November 27, 2012 at 8:19pm EST
yup

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 2:53pm EST
NICK DEVLIN

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 2:53pm EST
AGH I MUST DISCUSS MY PROJECT WITH YOU BUT I HAVE TO LEAVE IN SEVEN MINUTES

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 3:03pm EST

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 3:03pm EST
HGIOESFDJ OK

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 3:03pm EST
What time should i have facebook on

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 3:04pm EST
5ish class ends at 4:45 depends on how hes feeling today, idk if he'll keep us the whole time

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 3:04pm EST
funfun

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 3:04pm EST
but i was thinking of making the point of my project the geometry of the geometry

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 3:04pm EST
~~~~~~

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 3:04pm EST
damn

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 3:04pm EST

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 3:20pm EST
Yeah watched that but I showed you the picture just bc you can see what each face can be broken up into

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 3:22pm EST
gotcha

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 3:22pm EST
5 came a lot sooner than i though

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 3:23pm EST
thought*

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 3:25pm EST
I'm in class lol

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 3:25pm EST
Didn't start yet though

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 3:27pm EST
Idk why I'm trying to do this There are lights like this in existence Why am I boring

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 3:30pm EST
you like to make cool things

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 3:30pm EST
and dont like

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 3:30pm EST
when the things you make arent awesome

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 3:30pm EST
so you dont make something purely from brain

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 3:30pm EST
cause who knows how it could turn out

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 3:30pm EST
it might suck

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 3:30pm EST
then youd have to do it all over

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 3:31pm EST
The problem is I don't even have straight brain ideas that could potentially be successful or a failure

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 3:31pm EST
you probly do

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 3:31pm EST
and just ignore them

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 3:32pm EST
If I did I'd be acting on them

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 3:32pm EST
:/

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 3:32pm EST
well im not sure how to help

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 3:32pm EST
i never have original ideas

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 3:32pm EST
i just google until i see enough things to mash together

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 4:06pm EST
I do have a problem With not letting things go

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 4:06pm EST
From like the moment I got this assignment I wanted to do something geometrical Which isn't necessarily a bad thing is it

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 4:06pm EST
That I wanted g d that

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 4:06pm EST
To do not g d

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 4:07pm EST
Idk

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 4:39pm EST
niiiiiiiiiiiick

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 4:53pm EST
soeryyryy

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 4:54pm EST
you said five

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 4:54pm EST
i got out a lot earlier than expectedlol

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 4:54pm EST
my writing teacher is as done as we are

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 4:54pm EST
i was explorating the art rooms

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 4:54pm EST
i really iwsh i had time/ money to take one

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 4:54pm EST
Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 4:54pm EST
anyywayyy

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 4:54pm EST
yes

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 4:54pm EST
shape

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 4:55pm EST
each point OKAY IF IT WOULDNT BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO DO

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 4:55pm EST
what i WANT

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 4:55pm EST
each pentagon point to be made out of plexi, or some sort of clear stuff. then on either end (you can see that in the grey) that would be frosted plexi

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 4:55pm EST
mkay

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 4:55pm EST
so it glows but no blinding light comin through it

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 4:56pm EST
and then the rest would obviously be like wood or something

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 4:56pm EST
opaque

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 4:56pm EST
AM I CORECT IN SAYING

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 4:56pm EST
correct *

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 4:56pm EST
that an equilateral triangle can be separated into three kites?

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 4:56pm EST
cause it looks like kites but im not sure

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 4:57pm EST
by kite do you mean quadrilateral with sequential congruent sides?

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 4:57pm EST
http://www.mathopenref.com/kite.html

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 4:57pm EST
lote

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 4:57pm EST
kite *

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 4:57pm EST
yes you do

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 4:58pm EST
so correct then im just trynna explain to her completely

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 4:59pm EST
yes you are correct

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 4:59pm EST
to obtuse angle of kite is like 120

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 5:00pm EST
the acute is 60

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 5:01pm EST
and the the congurent angles are 90

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 5:01pm EST
it all matches up

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 5:02pm EST
this is all 2d right?

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 5:02pm EST
what?

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 5:02pm EST
the shape?

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 5:02pm EST
the whole thing?

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 5:02pm EST
MY PROJECT

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 5:03pm EST
the equalateral triangle

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 5:03pm EST
that you ar easking about

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 5:03pm EST
with the kite thing

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 5:03pm EST
yes in relation to the icosahedron how i separated it

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 5:03pm EST
then yes

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 5:03pm EST
everything we stated above is correct

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 5:03pm EST
im trying to explain to betty and i didnt want to use the wrong quadrilateral name or something stoophid

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 5:04pm EST
the kites are made by drawing perpendicular lines from the midpoint of each side to the center of the triangle

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 5:04pm EST
youre all good

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 5:05pm EST
i've totally made this shape from magnets before

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 5:05pm EST
like a million times

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 6:14pm EST
SHE SENT ME ONE SENTENCE BACK.

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 6:15pm EST
I like the idea of light accentuating edges and corners. Go for it.

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 6:18pm EST
would i have to build a frame for this?

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 6:18pm EST
or could i just make the shapes?

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 6:29pm EST
sorry

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 6:29pm EST
umm?

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 6:29pm EST
i mean a frame wouldnt hurt

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 6:29pm EST
except for timewise

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 6:30pm EST
and it might help with the whole craftsmenship thing, I mean since the light will penetrate the sides

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 6:30pm EST
a frame would help give more definition

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 6:53pm EST
i really need to eat

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 6:53pm EST
i forgot and now im all shaky -.-

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 6:53pm EST
Go eattttt

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 6:53pm EST
im cooking now

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 6:54pm EST
and since cooking will take too long

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 6:54pm EST
and i am annoyed by shaky hands

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 6:54pm EST
i am making ramen to eat while i cook

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 6:56pm EST
But what do I make the frame with The corners would be out of plexi I don't know if it'd look nice with a frame next to it

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 6:57pm EST
hmm

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 6:57pm EST
what materials are you thinking of?

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 6:57pm EST
Id asume the frame would need to be completely opaque

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 6:58pm EST
and that would gve it a slight wire frame appearance

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 6:58pm EST
Well ignoring frames then wood and plexi

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 6:59pm EST
hmm

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 6:59pm EST
if youre pressed for time id say avoid the frame

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 6:59pm EST
if you have the time make it

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 7:00pm EST
and use whatever is cheapest

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 7:00pm EST
you wont see the actual material of the frame will you?

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:00pm EST
It need to be done by next Thursday

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 7:00pm EST
idk how fast you make stuff

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:00pm EST
I don't know

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:00pm EST
I think she thought the red parts of my drawing were meant to b accentuated

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:01pm EST
But

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:01pm EST
Nah

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:01pm EST
Well actually

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:02pm EST
Did you read the email

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 7:02pm EST
yes

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 7:03pm EST
i did

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:04pm EST
um

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:04pm EST
okay

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:04pm EST
so i mentioned the whole shapes thing

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:04pm EST
but

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:04pm EST
will you be able to tell

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 7:04pm EST
i did

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:04pm EST
if

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:05pm EST
i dont know how to word

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:05pm EST
like see how lines separate every shape?

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:05pm EST
like what if that red thing was a frame, but wont be there. and imagine it without the black lines

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 7:05pm EST
will the shapes be defined?

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:06pm EST
how cause i mean like on the top you have the little triangle of plexi the pentagon of frosted plexi and then the two kites

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:06pm EST
well

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:06pm EST
those are pentagons kind of too cause they have triangles of plexi

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:06pm EST
but theyre both made of wood

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:06pm EST
oh

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:06pm EST
wait

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:07pm EST
youd be able to tell then still

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:07pm EST
cause of the frosted plexi one

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 7:07pm EST
mhmm

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:08pm EST
ugh

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 7:10pm EST
pretty much

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 7:11pm EST
why do you hate me????

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:11pm EST
what are you talking about

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 7:11pm EST
my sister is an idio

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:11pm EST
-.-

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 7:11pm EST
hey hey not nice

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
i'm probably just gonna die so i dont need to do this project

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 7:14pm EST
that is true

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:14pm EST
THAT IS NOT HELPING ME

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 7:14pm EST
I mean

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 7:14pm EST
steph

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
you are a genius

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
you need to finish this project

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
rude

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 7:15pm EST

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 7:18pm EST
rebecca just screamed

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 7:18pm EST
I DIDNT MEAN TOO YO!

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 7:18pm EST
you are her idol

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 7:18pm EST

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 7:18pm EST
you have to do this for her

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:20pm EST

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 7:21pm EST
your project

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 7:23pm EST
im being harassed

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 7:23pm EST
and abused my nick :(

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 7:23pm EST

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 7:44pm EST
im here if ya need help or a sounding board or something

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:18pm EST
so i made an icosahedron out of that net with the tabs its pretty ratchet but it gets the job done

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:19pm EST
study model numero uno

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:28pm EST
also question if you ever return

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:30pm EST
return

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:30pm EST
i have

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:32pm EST
if i were

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:32pm EST
backtrack

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:32pm EST
I THINK I found a way to make this kinda

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:33pm EST
if i miter the edges of my triangles

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:33pm EST
do you think thatd work, if so, what angle do you think id have to miter them?

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:33pm EST
would 30 work?

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:33pm EST
are you using wood

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:33pm EST
?

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:34pm EST
yes

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:34pm EST
well partially

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:34pm EST
how thick?

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:34pm EST
and are you mitering everything or just the wood

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:34pm EST
it needs to be at least 1/8 to miter

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:34pm EST
everything

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:34pm EST
hmmm

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:34pm EST
imagine the plexi attached to the wood

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:35pm EST
im going to talk to her about this tomorrow. if i can make this all work, and get everything down, if i can attach the plexi to the wood first and then miter

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:35pm EST
138.189685°

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:35pm EST
dihedral angle

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:35pm EST
arccos(-v5/3)

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:35pm EST
is the equstion they used to get that num

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:36pm EST
so half that

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:36pm EST
its be like 70

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:36pm EST
i think i need to draw it out

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:36pm EST
yeah itd have to be more than 45 wouldnt it damn it

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:37pm EST
yes it would

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:37pm EST
i dont think i can do that in the shop

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:37pm EST
it only goes to 45

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:38pm EST
google is literally the opposite of help rn

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:39pm EST
i figured it out

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:39pm EST
i will send you picture

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:41pm EST
it is hard to explain

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:41pm EST
Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:43pm EST
that's not how mitering works

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:43pm EST
oh i see

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:43pm EST
didnt read the arrows

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:43pm EST
sorry

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:43pm EST
i was like

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:43pm EST
how am i making all of these weird angles

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:43pm EST
wait no still hold on

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:44pm EST
okay but the thing is

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:46pm EST
?

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:48pm EST
Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:48pm EST
that's what you're looking for reference as far as the angle you need to cut for mitering

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:48pm EST
it's what's being removed

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:49pm EST
ahh

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:49pm EST
gotcha

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:49pm EST
on sec

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:50pm EST
that would be 20

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:50pm EST
70+20=90

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:51pm EST
why would i need a 90 degree angle

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:52pm EST
ugh

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:52pm EST
Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:52pm EST
because a piece of wood has 90 degree angles

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:53pm EST
yeah?

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:53pm EST
give me a minute

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:55pm EST
Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 8:55pm EST
so those poorly drawn edges would connect

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:59pm EST
here

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 8:59pm EST
one sec

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 9:05pm EST
it wont load

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 9:05pm EST
retrying

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 9:05pm EST
Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 9:05pm EST
there we go

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
the smaller side of the shape would obviously be the 'bottom

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
the face of the inside

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
what youre telling me is i need to miter at 20 degrees

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
which you have drawn at 45 lol

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
for every edge of the triangle

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
yes

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
well yeah paint is not a science

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
you get the idea!

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
but

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
:'(

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 9:07pm EST
hmm?

Steph Dudak November 28, 2012 at 9:07pm EST
i need to find a way to test this myself i appreciate your help very much

Nick Devlin November 28, 2012 at 9:08pm EST
no prob

Nick Devlin November 29, 2012 at 6:49pm EST
steph?

Steph Dudak November 29, 2012 at 6:49pm EST

Nick Devlin November 29, 2012 at 6:49pm EST
sara told me to talk to you

Nick Devlin November 29, 2012 at 6:49pm EST
OHHHHH

Nick Devlin November 29, 2012 at 6:49pm EST
i figured out why

Steph Dudak November 29, 2012 at 6:50pm EST
...

Steph Dudak November 29, 2012 at 6:50pm EST
why?

Nick Devlin November 29, 2012 at 6:50pm EST
I thought like you couldnt contact me and told sara that you wanted to talk to me or something

Nick Devlin November 29, 2012 at 6:50pm EST
then i remember the previous text i sent sara

Nick Devlin November 29, 2012 at 6:50pm EST
and realized i am stupid

Steph Dudak November 29, 2012 at 6:50pm EST
oh well thats good lol

Nick Devlin November 29, 2012 at 6:51pm EST
I was complaining that i couldnt complain to sara about making her gift because then i would be giving her too much info and ruin the surprise

Nick Devlin November 29, 2012 at 6:51pm EST
so she told me to talk to you

Steph Dudak November 29, 2012 at 6:51pm EST
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh

Nick Devlin November 29, 2012 at 6:51pm EST
I am a genius

Steph Dudak November 29, 2012 at 6:51pm EST
all sense is made

Nick Devlin November 29, 2012 at 6:52pm EST
i love when people use my phrases

Nick Devlin November 29, 2012 at 6:52pm EST

Steph Dudak November 29, 2012 at 6:53pm EST
in studioooo

Steph Dudak November 29, 2012 at 6:53pm EST
MADE ANOTHER STUDY MODEL

Steph Dudak November 29, 2012 at 6:53pm EST
AN ACTUAL SIZE ONE CAN YOU SKYPE

Nick Devlin November 29, 2012 at 6:53pm EST
mhmm

Nick Devlin November 30, 2012 at 10:14am EST
"Not even my old grandfather of more than 60+ years of working wood by hand would try mitering plywood by hand."

Nick Devlin November 30, 2012 at 10:14am EST
Better figure out somethin

Steph Dudak November 30, 2012 at 10:14am EST
I told you. When do you need this done by

Nick Devlin November 30, 2012 at 10:15am EST
the 9th

Nick Devlin November 30, 2012 at 10:16am EST
I have a circular saw

Nick Devlin November 30, 2012 at 10:16am EST
and I am looking at ways it might be possible to use that

Nick Devlin November 30, 2012 at 10:19am EST
i am looking to see if they sell basswood in other stores

Steph Dudak November 30, 2012 at 10:21am EST
If you want I can get some for you and send rich home with it. The only thing is at the school they only sell 4x24 in planks idk of bigger

Nick Devlin November 30, 2012 at 10:23am EST
really?

Nick Devlin November 30, 2012 at 10:23am EST
that would be amazing

Nick Devlin November 30, 2012 at 10:23am EST

Steph Dudak November 30, 2012 at 10:25am EST
I'mma get you 1/8 it's easy to work with

Nick Devlin November 30, 2012 at 10:25am EST
i'll only need one for my dimmension

Nick Devlin November 30, 2012 at 10:25am EST
you decide thickness because you would know

Nick Devlin November 30, 2012 at 10:25am EST

Nick Devlin November 30, 2012 at 10:55am EST
plus its in Central Park

Steph Dudak November 30, 2012 at 12:07pm EST
I used part of that picture for my sketch but altered it a bit! Gonna draw it exactly this time though

Nick Devlin November 30, 2012 at 12:50pm EST
yeahhh

Nick Devlin November 30, 2012 at 12:50pm EST
awesome!

Steph Dudak November 30, 2012 at 12:51pm EST
btw i got your wood i also have hella scrap wood that's 1/4" so i'm gonna give you that too if you feel like you'd rather use that or even if you have other little projects you want to do cause i have no use for it

Nick Devlin November 30, 2012 at 12:51pm EST
awesome!!

Steph Dudak November 30, 2012 at 12:56pm EST
now i'm going to attempt to make an icosahedron out of mylar because i might want to use it instead of regular paper

Nick Devlin November 30, 2012 at 12:57pm EST
that sounds like some work

Nick Devlin November 30, 2012 at 12:57pm EST
do you have to do that?

Steph Dudak November 30, 2012 at 12:57pm EST
no i don't

Steph Dudak November 30, 2012 at 12:58pm EST
i already made this thing out of paper twice

Steph Dudak November 30, 2012 at 12:58pm EST

Nick Devlin November 30, 2012 at 12:59pm EST
:P

Steph Dudak November 30, 2012 at 12:59pm EST
its not like its a thing that's going to take me hours no i dont need to make a whole entire shape probably

Steph Dudak November 30, 2012 at 12:59pm EST
but its easier for me to tell if i can make it work by doing so

Nick Devlin November 30, 2012 at 12:59pm EST
exactly

Steph Dudak November 30, 2012 at 12:59pm EST
im not required to do all of this

Nick Devlin November 30, 2012 at 1:00pm EST

Steph Dudak December 1, 2012 at 5:58pm EST
oh

Nick Devlin December 1, 2012 at 5:58pm EST
its really easy and I'm scared I'm doing the wrong work

Steph Dudak December 1, 2012 at 5:59pm EST
ooooooooooooooooooooh

Nick Devlin December 1, 2012 at 5:59pm EST
we're just doing linits again

Nick Devlin December 1, 2012 at 6:00pm EST
but they added limits to it

Nick Devlin December 1, 2012 at 6:00pm EST
infinity*

Nick Devlin December 1, 2012 at 6:24pm EST
quick question, idk if you'd know

Nick Devlin December 1, 2012 at 6:25pm EST
the limit of 1/infinity is 0, does that mean the limit of 10/infinity is also 0?

Nick Devlin December 1, 2012 at 6:32pm EST
figured it out

Nick Devlin December 1, 2012 at 6:32pm EST
sorry for the random question

Steph Dudak December 1, 2012 at 6:32pm EST

Steph Dudak December 1, 2012 at 6:32pm EST

Nick Devlin December 1, 2012 at 6:39pm EST

Nick Devlin December 1, 2012 at 6:39pm EST
define 'ratchet'

Nick Devlin December 1, 2012 at 6:39pm EST
or whatever that word steph says

Steph Dudak December 1, 2012 at 6:39pm EST
ratchet(adj) - shitty looking thing

Nick Devlin December 1, 2012 at 6:40pm EST
thank you

Steph Dudak December 1, 2012 at 6:40pm EST
"That thing looks ratchet as hell!"

Steph Dudak December 1, 2012 at 6:40pm EST
"That ghetto ass nigga is ratchet as fuck."

Nick Devlin December 1, 2012 at 6:41pm EST
just wanted to check

Steph Dudak December 1, 2012 at 6:42pm EST
yeah she says it all the time now

Nick Devlin December 1, 2012 at 6:42pm EST
i know

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 5:57pm EST
STEPH THANK YOU

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 5:57pm EST
Rich just dropped off da wood

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 5:57pm EST
no problem! let me know how it goes, hope the two 1/8 planks are enough

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 5:58pm EST
more than enough, all my pieces i am cutting out fit on the one board

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 5:58pm EST
i can cut the 3/16 with an xacto knife right?

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 5:58pm EST
or should i use a box cutter or something

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 6:00pm EST
you can but itd be difficult. youll have to go through it a bunch of times and be careful of the wood splitting etc

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 6:05pm EST
yeah i thought so

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 6:05pm EST
going over it 400 times would be better than sawing to me though

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 6:10pm EST
whatever works for you

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 6:10pm EST
i just wanted to check that it was a feasible option

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 6:11pm EST
oh yeah ive done it like i said you just need to be really careful

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 6:12pm EST
any advice?

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 6:14pm EST
just make sure youre cutting up against something straight that the xacto knife cant cut into also something that wont slide against the wood and just go over whatever line you draw as straight as possible

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 6:16pm EST
awesome

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 6:16pm EST
thanks

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 6:16pm EST
going caroling now -.-

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 6:16pm EST
lol have fun!

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
they never told me id be caroling in front of a crowd at town hall

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
LOL WHAT

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 8:56pm EST
yeahhh

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 8:56pm EST
twas awkward

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:03pm EST
this stuff you gave me is amazing

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:04pm EST
glad it's working out for you! what's even more awesome is staining it. i know you're covering it with fabric and whatever but idk staining wood is just fun to me lol

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:05pm EST
I almost want to leave it like this and stain it

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:05pm EST
but i'll save that for another day

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
itd look awesome either way a nice reddish stain

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
sedona red is nice, i used that on my last model. i have this red mahogany stain marker which is like a really dark brown but it has a very slight red tint to it and i actually like it now more than i did when i tested it a few days ago

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
thats awesome

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
would be a nice floor color

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:07pm EST
I just wand to buy a ton of this stuff

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:07pm EST
it cuts so nicely

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:07pm EST
and no dust

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:08pm EST
you can do so much with it too if you ever make a trek to utrecht they have even bigger sheets of that stuff. that's like 6" wide instead of 4, squarer sheets it's cool. i'm not really sure how expensive it is, despite me buying it all the time. i just know i have to get it so i just buy it. but it doesnt really break the bank and it's worth it

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:09pm EST
about 35 bucks

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:09pm EST
i hcecked when you told me about it

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:09pm EST
for how much?

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:10pm EST
some sheets

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:10pm EST
pretty big not sure how big

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:12pm EST
i have receipts on receipts idk why ididnt check them lol. the 4x24 ones are like 1.78 and up depending on thickness

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:12pm EST
thats really cheap

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:13pm EST
also

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:13pm EST
if you go to utrecht and youre a student

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:13pm EST
you can get like a student card thingy

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:13pm EST
like for other stores that you can put on your keychain i got one last time i went there cause free and i got like 10% off my purchase

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:13pm EST
so cool

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:14pm EST
ughh the grain doesnt even matter

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:15pm EST
i cut it in every direction

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:15pm EST
omg its so great cutting with the grain though its so smooth haha

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:15pm EST
i know against the grain is amazing

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:16pm EST
but with the grain idk which side was even the part i cut

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:17pm EST
your box is gonna come out awesome, i expect to see when it's done!

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:17pm EST
of course!

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:17pm EST
I will document the process I think

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:18pm EST
just to show sara all the work i did!!

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:18pm EST
yeeees progression pictures she's gonna love it

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:19pm EST
i only have a wek to do it

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:19pm EST
and all my school worjk

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:19pm EST
is this what art school feels like

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:20pm EST
yes but on a much bigger scale and then add drawings of the object, drafted, on mylar, with different line weights

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:21pm EST
only thing is other classes dont matter as much as design

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:22pm EST
and are more or less smooth sailing

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:23pm EST
ALSO make life easy for yourself if youre xacto knife cutting all that, change your blade fairly often

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:24pm EST
funfun

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:24pm EST
and how do i miter

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:26pm EST
welll are you doing it by hand?

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:26pm EST
mhmm

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:27pm EST
do you have any way of getting to a machine that does that? a table saw, a sander,

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:27pm EST
do you think the wood shop at intermediate east would have anything like that?

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:27pm EST
i have a sander

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:28pm EST
like one of theose vibraty things you put a piece of sandpaper on right?

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:29pm EST
i suppose lol i dont have anything like that i mean like in the shop here they have big machines, theyre circular and theyre plugged in. you turn them on and they spin and when you put a thing up against it it sands away. they have a 45 degree one too

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:29pm EST
which you can also use to miter

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:29pm EST
yeah i dont have any big machines

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:29pm EST
i guess all youd do is put a corner up against it

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:29pm EST
and then sand it to the other corner til its at that angle

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:30pm EST
well i mean idk what it is you have lol

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:31pm EST
its basically a faster way to sand by hand

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:31pm EST
you hold it against what you are sanding and it just grinds away

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:32pm EST
so basically same thing you can try that

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:32pm EST
i shall

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:32pm EST
on a test piece

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:32pm EST
god idea

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:32pm EST

Steph Dudak December 2, 2012 at 9:32pm EST

Nick Devlin December 2, 2012 at 9:38pm EST

god dammit

Nick Devlin December 3, 2012 at 11:04pm EST

Nick Devlin December 3, 2012 at 11:05pm EST

Nick Devlin December 3, 2012 at 11:05pm EST

Nick Devlin December 3, 2012 at 11:05pm EST

Nick Devlin December 4, 2012 at 9:49am EST
my mom hasnt been able to drive me anywhere the past week, nor will she be able to until I leave, thats one of the reasons I havent been able to go anywhere to get stuff

Nick Devlin December 4, 2012 at 9:50am EST
plus i dont even know anyone at int east. so i have no clue who to ask

Nick Devlin December 4, 2012 at 10:41pm EST
Nick Devlin December 4, 2012 at 10:42pm EST
It doesn't suck!!!

Nick Devlin December 5, 2012 at 10:59am EST
math is hard

Steph Dudak December 5, 2012 at 10:59am EST
i'm sorry

Nick Devlin December 5, 2012 at 11:00am EST
but its still funish

Nick Devlin December 5, 2012 at 11:00am EST
so its all good

Nick Devlin December 5, 2012 at 11:00am EST
i suppose

its takes a day or two to understand the format

Nick Devlin December 6, 2012 at 8:38am EST
but the highlited blue name is snoop dogs answers

I poseted in movie group all the pictureof my box process

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 12:26am EST
you light thing

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 12:26am EST
is amazing

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 12:26am EST
it looks so cool

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 12:35am EST
i just looked through it I AM YOUR BEST FRIEND :D IT CAME OUT SO GOOD IM SO PROUD OF YOU! & thank you so much :D it's actualy pretty ratchet because it didn't fit together perfectly but i'm starting to like it ore

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 12:36am EST
more *

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 12:36am EST
:D

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 12:36am EST
i like the stain you ised

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 12:37am EST
it's actually much darker in person! but it looks really nice with the mylar. im probably gonna bring it home with me to show people so you can see it in person

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 12:37am EST
hang it up! it'd look so cool

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 12:37am EST
it's not supposed to hang homie!

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 12:37am EST
or like as a thing for nightstand

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 12:38am EST
it is an object so you can put it on a table, nightstand, bookshelf. so you can pick it up and move it around and such

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 12:38am EST
i didnt want strings or wires

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 12:38am EST
gotch

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 12:38am EST
ruins the geometry

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 12:38am EST
gotcha*

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 12:38am EST
but imagine like 40 of them hanging in an openish room

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 12:39am EST
at different levels

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 12:39am EST
oh that'd look sweet

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 12:39am EST
and if they slowly rotate

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 12:39am EST
that would be awesome

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 12:40am EST
i kind of want to make another one of these

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 12:40am EST
but id need to figure a better way to light it

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 12:40am EST
fun

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 12:40am EST
I just wanted to congradulate you on your project and show off my

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
nope

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:13pm EST
need some weird log in or sometih\

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:13pm EST
oh true okay

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:13pm EST
Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:13pm EST
how bout that

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:14pm EST
it opens

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:14pm EST
ooh fancy

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:14pm EST
limits

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:14pm EST
WONDERFUL

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:14pm EST
yes

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:14pm EST
forget

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:14pm EST
do i plug in 0

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
yep

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
and then get 0/0 which dne so right and left hand i remember

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
adding and subtracting .01 is that from 0?

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
and then plug into eq?

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
nah that's too much work

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
you fuck around with the equation till you can plug in zero and get a real number

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
...

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
so for the first

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:16pm EST
first you factor

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:16pm EST
try to simply that way

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:16pm EST
see if it become a real number

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:17pm EST
you get x/(x(x-3))

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:17pm EST
x's cancel out

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:17pm EST
1/x-3

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:17pm EST
plug in zero

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:17pm EST
bam

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:17pm EST
-1/3

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:19pm EST
of course i'm probly wrong

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:19pm EST
I'll double check just to make sure

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:20pm EST
ooooo

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:20pm EST
one sec

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:20pm EST
np

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:21pm EST
yes!

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:21pm EST
alright so now vertical asymptotes

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:21pm EST
x = 3

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:22pm EST
mhmm

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:22pm EST
now values for f where f(x) is continuous

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:22pm EST
dont remember either

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:22pm EST
thats just the domain

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:22pm EST
find all the holes and asymptotes

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:23pm EST
so where ever the function is undefined, or DNE

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:23pm EST
so basically set the denominator to 0

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:23pm EST
find all possible values for x

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:24pm EST
which is 3, and 0

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:24pm EST
thats all I can find

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:24pm EST
when x doesnt equal 0 and doesnt equal 3

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:24pm EST
so idk how your teacher wants it

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:24pm EST
f(x) is continuous if x ? 0, x ? 3

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:24pm EST
its that same thing

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
you need to do that

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
its continuous at not those points

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
mine likes (negative infinity, 0), (0,3),(3, infinity

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
oh yeah

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
set builder notation or whatever that junk is

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
fuckin

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
theres another one

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
interval

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
notation

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
I never learned it

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
wong gives no fuck

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
either actually

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
thats what interval notation is

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
whatevs

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
what you sent me

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
awesome

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
makes sense

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:26pm EST
so basically you have a few tricks to find the limit when you get 0/0

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:26pm EST
factor

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:26pm EST
conjugate

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:26pm EST
trig identities

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:27pm EST
theres some more i think

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:28pm EST
word

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:28pm EST
yeah

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:28pm EST
basically just fuck around with the equation

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:29pm EST
ooh finding derivative

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:29pm EST
doin that nao

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:30pm EST
tell me if ya get stuck

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:30pm EST
Just finished all that derivative shtuff

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:31pm EST
do you add or subtract one from exponents when youre doing derivatives omg

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:32pm EST
...

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:32pm EST
damn

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:32pm EST
:P

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:32pm EST
x^3

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:32pm EST
3x^2

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:32pm EST
subtract thought so

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:32pm EST
remember to multiply the number to the coefficient

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:32pm EST
yep!

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:33pm EST
did you ever solve that stuff the long way

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:33pm EST
my god

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:33pm EST
its horrifying

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:33pm EST
to solve for derivative using limits

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:33pm EST
like 2 pages

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:34pm EST
i dont think so im not sure

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:34pm EST
got this one right

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:36pm EST
which?

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:36pm EST
just the number i'll solve and see if you are right

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:37pm EST
oh jk

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:37pm EST
you got it right

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:37pm EST
i tought you said you werent sure

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:37pm EST
good job then!

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:41pm EST
but the next question i always mess up on logs

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:41pm EST
i know its gonna be 2x

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:41pm EST
logs are awesome now

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:41pm EST
cause the x^2

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:41pm EST
but the ln8x how

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:42pm EST
did you learn product and chain rule?

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:42pm EST
omg dumb

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:42pm EST
funfun

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:45pm EST
alright

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:45pm EST
wait

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:45pm EST
so chain rule

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:45pm EST
mhmm

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:45pm EST
ln8x 1. u= 8x 2. f(u)= lnu 3. u'=8 4. f'(u)=1/u * u'

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:46pm EST
mhmm

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:46pm EST
it seems so complicated when written that way

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:46pm EST
but yes

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:46pm EST
1/8x * 8

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:46pm EST
yes

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:46pm EST
8/8x = 1/x ..

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:46pm EST
yes

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:47pm EST
and then

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:48pm EST
...

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:49pm EST
3)	f'(x) = 2x ln 8x + x this is the answer

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:49pm EST
thats what i got

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:49pm EST
what do i do after i get 1/x

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:49pm EST
what did i just do

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:50pm EST
f(x)=x^2

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:50pm EST
g(x)=ln(8x)

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:50pm EST
product rule

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:50pm EST
f'(x)g(x)+f(x)g'(x)

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:50pm EST
OMG

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:51pm EST
DUMB

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:51pm EST
OKAY

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:51pm EST
GOT IT THANKS

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:51pm EST
:)

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:51pm EST
chain rule is only for things inside other function

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:51pm EST
so you use both in this problem

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:51pm EST
i just for some reason did not understand that you could do product rule like it wasnt a thing in my head idk THANK YOU

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:53pm EST
np

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:56pm EST
have you done integrals yet

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:56pm EST
yup

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:57pm EST
numero 6

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:58pm EST
x

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:58pm EST
x^2/2

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:58pm EST
3x^2

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:58pm EST
wait

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:58pm EST
what are you doing

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:59pm EST
2x^3 - 9x^-2 find integral

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:59pm EST
i am trying to give example then explain

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:59pm EST
x becomes

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:59pm EST
x^2/2

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:59pm EST
add one to exponent

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:59pm EST
and exponent underneath

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:59pm EST
divide by that new exponent

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 7:59pm EST
yeah

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 7:59pm EST
2x4/4 ???

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:01pm EST
umm

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:01pm EST
yes

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:01pm EST
then

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:01pm EST
thats what i got

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:01pm EST
x^4/2

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:01pm EST
yup

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:04pm EST
alright part b

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:04pm EST
cause i got the integral fora x^4/2 + 9/x + C

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:05pm EST
dont i have to like

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:05pm EST
shouldnt it be

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:05pm EST
nevermind

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:05pm EST
that integral is right i checked

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:06pm EST
yes it is

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:06pm EST
i minues somewhere

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:06pm EST
i dont know what you mean by that

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:06pm EST
i need help with part b tho

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:06pm EST
no prob

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:07pm EST
I made an error with negatives

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:07pm EST
that was my problem

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:07pm EST
you know the integral formula thingy right?

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:07pm EST
what do you meeeeeeean

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:07pm EST
b^(n+1)/(n+1)-a(n+1)/(n+1)

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:07pm EST
what

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
basically you subtract

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
sorry havent spent that long on integrals

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
and have no notes with me to see examples

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
i know theyre easy

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
put the bigger number into the problem

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
i thought i have to plug in 1

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
you plug in both

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
do i plug it into the original equation

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
or do i need to use the integral from the first

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
and plug them into that

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
use the integral

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
so integral of 3 MINUS integral of 1

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
YES

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
okay thats all you had to say lol

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:10pm EST
sorry its hard to explain

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:10pm EST
dont give me real formulas aint nobody know those

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:10pm EST
cause dumb math teacher

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:10pm EST
i looked up the real formulas cause I had no clue how to explain

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:10pm EST
I didnt know them either

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:10pm EST
but they make sense when you look at them

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:14pm EST
true

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:14pm EST
alright so how do i got about 7 sorry im askin all these questions i just need to make sure i can do all this

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:16pm EST
no prob

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:16pm EST
basically you gotta sorta use the chain rule

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:17pm EST
okay how

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:17pm EST
-x^8+4

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:17pm EST
here watch this, its too much for me too explain

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:18pm EST
and the part you mentioned is what you want for u

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:22pm EST
okay but when i do that i get -8x^7 dx for du

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:23pm EST
i'm pretty sure the dx just goes away or something, I'm not entirely sure

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:24pm EST
dx= du/-8x^7

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:24pm EST
ive done something like thatbefore in a problem

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:24pm EST
it doesnt just disappear unless its exactly whats already in the problem

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:24pm EST
the only part thats in there is the x^7

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:24pm EST
hmm

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:24pm EST
not the -8

Nick Devlin December 10, 2012 at 8:25pm EST

Steph Dudak December 10, 2012 at 8:25pm EST

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 3:58pm EST
disappointed

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 3:59pm EST
you can do better than that

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 3:59pm EST
i expect a 105 at least

Steph Dudak December 14, 2012 at 4:14pm EST
Yeah I know I'm so bad I wonder what those two points were for though Also C+ in drawing cause Morna hates me

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 4:14pm EST
:/

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 4:14pm EST
whatver

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 4:15pm EST
do you know why?

Steph Dudak December 14, 2012 at 4:16pm EST
No like actual reason I think she just doesn't like me/my work

Steph Dudak December 14, 2012 at 4:16pm EST
Because

Steph Dudak December 14, 2012 at 4:17pm EST
Sean's missed 6 or 7 classes, missed a few assignments im sure and he got a B. a solid B. he had a D by midterms. Love him but makes no sense. I missed three classes and I only didn't hand in one assignment and didn't finish one

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 4:18pm EST
that would infuriate me, or i'd probly just not give a shit

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 4:18pm EST
depends how much work i put into it

Steph Dudak December 14, 2012 at 4:21pm EST
It's frustrating because even though I hated her and her class I did try

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 4:21pm EST
thats what would make me mad too

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 4:22pm EST
well hopefully you'll never have her again

Steph Dudak December 14, 2012 at 4:22pm EST
If I get her for any class for any reason I am immediately getting out of it Idc what it takes

Steph Dudak December 14, 2012 at 4:22pm EST
If I have to take an 8am instead that's what'll happen

Steph Dudak December 14, 2012 at 4:22pm EST
I know I won't have her next semester

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 4:23pm EST
good

Steph Dudak December 14, 2012 at 4:23pm EST
Pretty sure she's not teaching technics of communication which is my drawing class

Steph Dudak December 14, 2012 at 4:23pm EST
If she is then BYE switching to Betty's 8:30

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 4:23pm EST
they dont tell you the teacher?

Steph Dudak December 14, 2012 at 4:27pm EST
Not for drawing and design because those classes are always up in the air as far as who's teaching what and when

Steph Dudak December 14, 2012 at 4:27pm EST
Betty just found out she's gonna be teaching that drawing class at whatever time

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 4:27pm EST
gotcha

Steph Dudak December 14, 2012 at 4:35pm EST
Stoophid Morna

Steph Dudak December 14, 2012 at 4:35pm EST
No more caring

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 4:35pm EST
nope

Steph Dudak December 14, 2012 at 4:35pm EST
Now I need to worry about Christmas gifts

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 4:35pm EST

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 4:35pm EST

Steph Dudak December 14, 2012 at 4:36pm EST
I don't even know who I need to get things for at this point Pretty sure you Amy and Richard are bout it

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 4:37pm EST

Steph Dudak December 14, 2012 at 4:40pm EST
Shoe fox 4?

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 4:40pm EST
oh

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 4:40pm EST
rich said he really wanted a picture of an ornate #4

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 4:41pm EST
so i plan to somehow integrate a fox and shoe into it

Steph Dudak December 14, 2012 at 4:41pm EST
Oh gotchu!

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 4:41pm EST
i still have no clue why he asked for a four

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 4:41pm EST
but whatever

Steph Dudak December 14, 2012 at 4:41pm EST
Favorite number

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 4:41pm EST
makes sense

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 4:42pm EST
not as good as 27 but alright

Steph Dudak December 14, 2012 at 4:42pm EST
Or 7

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 4:42pm EST
seven's okay too

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 4:42pm EST
i remember it turns 8 into 15

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 4:43pm EST
and i hate 8

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 4:43pm EST
so 7 was cool for making 8 not suck

Steph Dudak December 14, 2012 at 4:43pm EST
Haha oh Nicholas

Nick Devlin December 14, 2012 at 4:44pm EST
i really have no clue why, i just remember all that from grade school

words

Nick Devlin December 16, 2012 at 6:06pm EST
not all of it, just firs tparagraph and last

Steph Dudak December 16, 2012 at 6:06pm EST
surely

Nick Devlin December 16, 2012 at 6:06pm EST
The term aquaponics is a portmanteau of the words hydroponics and aquaculture, methods of farming plants and fish respectively. To understand aquaponics and all of its benefits fully, it is important to understand the two methods of farming from which it is derived. The basic system of aquaponics is that a cycle of nitrogen is created between fish, plants and bacteria, allowing them to support each other. The fish are bred in pools of water. The water becomes heavily laden with nutrients and chemicals, so much so that the water would be toxic, if the bacteria did not convert the ammonia given off by the fish into nitrites, then into nitrates. The nitrate filled water is then pumped into the plants water supply. The plants filter out all of the chemicals leaving them clean enough for the fish to live in (Diver). To fully understand how beneficial this system it will be compared to both of the systems it is based off of.

Steph Dudak December 16, 2012 at 6:08pm EST
To fully understand how beneficial this system it will be compared to both of the systems it is based off of. should there be an is between beneficial this system it

Steph Dudak December 16, 2012 at 6:08pm EST
otherwise i think that is a wonderful paragraph

Nick Devlin December 16, 2012 at 6:09pm EST
awesome

Nick Devlin December 16, 2012 at 6:09pm EST
oops

Nick Devlin December 16, 2012 at 6:09pm EST
wrote the same sentence twice :/

Steph Dudak December 16, 2012 at 6:10pm EST
you basically said that in the beginning

Nick Devlin December 16, 2012 at 6:10pm EST
yep i just didnt realize it

Steph Dudak December 16, 2012 at 6:10pm EST
i didn't either til just now lol i'm getting worse at paper writing and analyzing i apologize

Steph Dudak December 16, 2012 at 6:11pm EST
my writing teacher this semester didn't do much for me, nor did mrs morgan senior year so i mean i'm just. what are papers

Nick Devlin December 16, 2012 at 6:11pm EST
I just want to make sure the sentences are legible sentences

Steph Dudak December 16, 2012 at 6:11pm EST
oh yes they are

Steph Dudak December 16, 2012 at 6:12pm EST
i think especially with the way you write sometimes you can't really tell if you've repeated yourself

Nick Devlin December 16, 2012 at 6:12pm EST
sometimes I get too into what I'm writing and it makes it impossible for others to understand

Steph Dudak December 16, 2012 at 6:12pm EST
and if you do they sound like slightly different ideas

Nick Devlin December 16, 2012 at 6:12pm EST
that too

Steph Dudak December 16, 2012 at 6:12pm EST
but in a way that it sounds okay

Steph Dudak December 16, 2012 at 6:12pm EST
and not that you're looking for more to write

Nick Devlin December 16, 2012 at 6:12pm EST
I am reiterating in order to emphasize the point

Nick Devlin December 16, 2012 at 6:12pm EST
yeahhh

Steph Dudak December 16, 2012 at 6:13pm EST
i just mean in general it sounds good and i don't find it confusing so

Nick Devlin December 16, 2012 at 6:14pm EST
thats all i'm looking for

Nick Devlin December 16, 2012 at 6:15pm EST
I really don't feel like putting much into this essay, I just want a passing grade, so I like deleted half of my points

Nick Devlin December 16, 2012 at 6:15pm EST
I have no quotes or stats either

Nick Devlin December 16, 2012 at 6:15pm EST

Nick Devlin December 16, 2012 at 6:16pm EST
except on the occasional project

Steph Dudak December 16, 2012 at 6:17pm EST
i don't think i've heard you say "i don't feel like putting much into this . . . i just want a passing grade" except maybe in your math class that you didn't have completed any real prerequisite for and if you have i am bad at paying attention or you havent said it to me

Steph Dudak December 16, 2012 at 6:17pm EST
i'll go with the latter

Nick Devlin December 16, 2012 at 6:18pm EST

i was going to ask you if you were aware of the quality of a pair of like slip on airwalks like http://www.payless.com/store/product/detail.jsp?catId=cat10089&subCatId=cat10295&skuId=096899105&productId=60504&lotId=096899&category=&catdisplayName=Mens but you dont buy shoes very often do you

Nick Devlin December 16, 2012 at 6:24pm EST
the only brand of shoe i've bought in the past 6 years

Nick Devlin December 16, 2012 at 6:24pm EST
is airwalks

Nick Devlin December 16, 2012 at 6:25pm EST
their comfortable last about 8 months of constant daily use before thei start to erode

Nick Devlin December 16, 2012 at 6:25pm EST
theyre

Nick Devlin December 16, 2012 at 6:25pm EST
*

Steph Dudak December 16, 2012 at 6:26pm EST
well what are the odds! do you think that applies to all kinds of shoes of that brand then? at least sneaker wise~

Steph Dudak December 16, 2012 at 6:26pm EST
as long as they last for a while

Nick Devlin December 16, 2012 at 6:27pm EST
I'd suppose so, I'd assume if they remained consistent for 5 years, they'd remain consistent in other forms of the shoe

Steph Dudak December 16, 2012 at 6:28pm EST
excellent

Nick Devlin December 16, 2012 at 6:31pm EST
arent you lucky

Nick Devlin December 16, 2012 at 6:45pm EST

Steph Dudak December 16, 2012 at 7:47pm EST

Steph Dudak December 16, 2012 at 8:16pm EST
imma be with him all day tomorrow, i'm assuming he won't be wearing shoes at some point because he doesn't even really like wearing shoes that much, and i'm sure at one point he'll have to walk out of whatever place we're at so i will resort to that because i don't want to spend money on bowling, and i don't want him to spend money on bowling because he spends enough money on me

Nick Devlin December 16, 2012 at 8:19pm EST

Nick Devlin December 18, 2012 at 12:43pm EST
did you seriously

Nick Devlin December 18, 2012 at 12:43pm EST
do that to our cookies

Nick Devlin December 18, 2012 at 12:43pm EST
how

Nick Devlin December 18, 2012 at 12:43pm EST
why?

Nick Devlin December 18, 2012 at 12:43pm EST
what?

Steph Dudak December 18, 2012 at 12:43pm EST
hahaha

Steph Dudak December 18, 2012 at 12:44pm EST
how: photoshop why: because they weren't greenscreened what: greenscreen cookies

Nick Devlin December 18, 2012 at 12:44pm EST
more in depth into how, thats perty cool

Steph Dudak December 18, 2012 at 12:45pm EST
selected the cookies with the magic wand tool, created a new layer and filled it with a rainbow gradient. then set the layer to i believe color

Nick Devlin December 18, 2012 at 12:45pm EST
hmm

Nick Devlin December 18, 2012 at 12:46pm EST
so that magic wand just automatically clicked only cookies?

Steph Dudak December 18, 2012 at 12:46pm EST
i clicked the cookies with it so it'd only select them

Steph Dudak December 18, 2012 at 12:46pm EST
that is the function of the magic wand tool, to select specific shapes

Nick Devlin December 18, 2012 at 12:46pm EST
weird, thats really useful

Steph Dudak December 18, 2012 at 12:47pm EST
after you get the selection you fill the new layer with the gradient and it only fills the selection

Nick Devlin December 18, 2012 at 12:47pm EST
i understand the coloration part, but the selection of only cookies blows my mind

Steph Dudak December 18, 2012 at 12:54pm EST
the wonders of photoshop

Nick Devlin December 18, 2012 at 12:54pm EST
magic

Nick Devlin December 18, 2012 at 12:56pm EST

Nick Devlin December 18, 2012 at 12:58pm EST
He doesnt want to use any social media and I told him I know some minor stuff

Nick Devlin December 18, 2012 at 12:58pm EST

Nick Devlin December 18, 2012 at 12:58pm EST

Nick Devlin December 18, 2012 at 12:58pm EST

Steph Dudak December 18, 2012 at 1:00pm EST

Nick Devlin December 18, 2012 at 1:01pm EST
yup told him that

Steph Dudak December 18, 2012 at 1:01pm EST
in order to get into that

Steph Dudak December 18, 2012 at 1:02pm EST
he'll need FTP

Steph Dudak December 18, 2012 at 1:02pm EST
i used to have a website that was just real easy but apparently that no longer exists?

Steph Dudak December 18, 2012 at 1:02pm EST

Steph Dudak December 18, 2012 at 1:04pm EST
from there i'm fairly certain you can straight up upload documents with the codes in them

Steph Dudak December 18, 2012 at 1:04pm EST
from there i'm fairly certain you can straight up upload documents with the codes in them

Steph Dudak December 18, 2012 at 1:04pm EST
purposely sending 10 times cause stupid

Nick Devlin December 18, 2012 at 1:04pm EST
no prob

Steph Dudak December 18, 2012 at 1:04pm EST
if not you just make a new page or something within the FTP. if i saw it i'd probably be able to actually

Steph Dudak December 18, 2012 at 1:04pm EST
like remember exactly and be of more help

Steph Dudak December 18, 2012 at 1:05pm EST
also need to think of what kind of website it is

Steph Dudak December 18, 2012 at 1:05pm EST
if it's set up like blog-style and you want people to be able to comment on things, get yourself php installed and cutenews

Steph Dudak December 18, 2012 at 1:06pm EST
that way all your pages are like .php

Steph Dudak December 18, 2012 at 1:06pm EST
you know

Nick Devlin December 18, 2012 at 1:06pm EST
i understand what you are saying

Nick Devlin December 18, 2012 at 1:06pm EST
but i don't know how to do any of these things

Steph Dudak December 18, 2012 at 1:07pm EST
i'm sure it's something that can be googled and then done cause i'm fairly certain i had to do it myself on my last ~website and that was when i was 13 so i'm pretty certain it's all easily done

Steph Dudak December 18, 2012 at 1:07pm EST
i just haven't done it in a while

Steph Dudak December 18, 2012 at 1:07pm EST
so i can't tell you exactly

Nick Devlin December 18, 2012 at 1:07pm EST
hmm, aight

Nick Devlin December 21, 2012 at 11:48pm EST

Steph Dudak December 21, 2012 at 11:48pm EST

on throwing in

Steph Dudak December 21, 2012 at 11:48pm EST

Steph Dudak February 1, 2013 at 11:12pm EST
they're not dots they're windows. like portholes.

Steph Dudak February 1, 2013 at 11:12pm EST
they're on both sides

Steph Dudak February 1, 2013 at 11:12pm EST

Nick Devlin February 1, 2013 at 11:12pm EST
thats cool

Nick Devlin February 1, 2013 at 11:13pm EST
but is there like any... patern or anything for the dots? or some reason as to why their all scrambled up

Steph Dudak February 1, 2013 at 11:13pm EST
he did it because he could

Nick Devlin February 1, 2013 at 11:14pm EST
wasnt sure

Steph Dudak February 1, 2013 at 11:14pm EST
literally most of rem koolhaas' things well there is really no pattern. and only one elevation drawing so we need to basically make up the other side. but some do like up. like you can construct lines horizontally and there are like rows of holes but they're just spread out

Steph Dudak February 1, 2013 at 11:14pm EST
they're also tapered

Steph Dudak February 1, 2013 at 11:14pm EST
and well actually

Steph Dudak February 1, 2013 at 11:14pm EST
they give like different views of outside, around the house, etc.

Nick Devlin February 1, 2013 at 11:15pm EST
fun!

Nick Devlin February 1, 2013 at 11:15pm EST
i wasnt sure if like

Nick Devlin February 1, 2013 at 11:15pm EST

Nick Devlin February 1, 2013 at 11:19pm EST

Steph Dudak February 1, 2013 at 11:19pm EST
his giant elevator is an office

Nick Devlin February 1, 2013 at 11:20pm EST

Nick Devlin February 1, 2013 at 11:20pm EST

Nick Devlin February 1, 2013 at 11:20pm EST
i'm assuming you have

Steph Dudak February 1, 2013 at 11:20pm EST
yes i have

Nick Devlin February 1, 2013 at 11:21pm EST
it was what i was thinking of

Nick Devlin February 1, 2013 at 11:21pm EST
when i thought of weird shadow effects from the winows

Nick Devlin February 1, 2013 at 11:22pm EST
no clue why

Steph Dudak February 1, 2013 at 11:23pm EST
no clue why either lol

Nick Devlin February 1, 2013 at 11:23pm EST
youre supposed to know these things!

Steph Dudak February 1, 2013 at 11:45pm EST
im sorry!

Nick Devlin February 1, 2013 at 11:45pm EST
you are forgiven

Steph Dudak February 4, 2013 at 11:12am EST
i feel like i'm getting dumber because my academic classes aren't real

Steph Dudak February 4, 2013 at 11:13am EST
and i'm already bad at history but i'm even worse now. we have to do these "reaction papers" on articles that we have to read and i can never seem to grasp the actual concept of the essays i hate them and i should be able to understand them but i don't so it makes it even harder to get going on writing death

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 11:44am EST
thats extrememly irritating

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 11:44am EST
what articles you reading about/ what events

Steph Dudak February 4, 2013 at 12:05pm EST
http://www.memorablequotations.com/SquareDeal.htm this

Steph Dudak February 4, 2013 at 12:05pm EST
i just cant stay focused on it

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:06pm EST
ughh i hate this writing style

Steph Dudak February 4, 2013 at 12:06pm EST
its not a particularly difficult assignment but idk like its just what are they arguing then what i have to say about it, if i agree, and how it pertains to today

Steph Dudak February 4, 2013 at 12:06pm EST
and its boring

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:07pm EST
yeah thats unfun

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:07pm EST
i tried to read but its like one giant sentence

Steph Dudak February 4, 2013 at 12:07pm EST
literally puts me to sleep

Steph Dudak February 4, 2013 at 12:08pm EST
i also do not like that writing style

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:08pm EST
it a lot a useless words to sort through

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:10pm EST
"In his turn, the capitalist who is really a conservative, the man who has forethought as well as patriotism, should heartily welcome every effort, legislative or otherwise, which has for its object to secure fair dealing by capital, corporate or individual, toward the public and toward the employee." Real Americans should accept laws that regulate fairness, even when they are from the government, which everyone hates.

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:10pm EST
see was that so hard?

Steph Dudak February 4, 2013 at 12:11pm EST
this is from 1903 BUT NO IT WASNT it's not hard to talk and write so everyone can understand

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:12pm EST
but apparently the style back then was to be as obtuse as possible

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:14pm EST
oh well, and btw that sentence took me like a minute to translate, otherwise i'd help more

Steph Dudak February 4, 2013 at 12:15pm EST
basically

Steph Dudak February 4, 2013 at 12:15pm EST
what this is getting at

Steph Dudak February 4, 2013 at 12:16pm EST
because it's a speech is his "Square Deal" so basically i'll telll what that is. say what i think about it,

Steph Dudak February 4, 2013 at 12:16pm EST
use some sort of examples from the text, how it applies to today i don't even

Steph Dudak February 4, 2013 at 12:16pm EST
ugh

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:16pm EST
it wouldnt be that bad

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:17pm EST
if it was legible

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:17pm EST
all right i'm actually reading it

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:17pm EST
its actually more readable if you just skim as opposed to reading it

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:18pm EST
theres tons of ways to relate this speech to today

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:18pm EST
the second paragraph for example

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:18pm EST
"It has been our profound good fortune as a nation that hitherto, disregarding exceptional periods of depression and the normal and inevitable fluctuations, there has been on the whole from the beginning of our government to the present day a progressive betterment alike in the condition of the tiller of the soil and in the condition of the man who, by his manual skill and labor, supports himself and his family, and endeavors to bring up his children so that they may be at least as well off as, and, if possible, better off than, he himself has been. There are, of course, exceptions, but as a whole the standard of living among the farmers of our country has risen from generation to generation, and the wealth represented on the farms has steadily increased, while the wages of labor have likewise risen, both as regards the actual money paid and as regards the purchasing power which that money represents."

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:18pm EST
America is awesome

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:18pm EST
we continually get better

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:18pm EST
and there have but a couple rocky moments

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:19pm EST
but overall we've always gone up in awesomeness

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:19pm EST
just like today

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:19pm EST
its been a rocky era, but most of the country lives in relative comfort, no epidemics or plagues. Workers rights, cultural rights

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:20pm EST
no wars at home

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:20pm EST
etc

Steph Dudak February 4, 2013 at 12:22pm EST
makes sense

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:25pm EST
almost every paragraph is like that

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:25pm EST
its just so irritating

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:26pm EST
I think the overall message is "Hey guys, I got this"

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:27pm EST
Oh here's a good section

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:28pm EST
it ties in with healthcare and shit nowadays

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:28pm EST
"Unfortunately, in this world the innocent frequently find themselves obliged to pay some of the penalty for the misdeeds of the guilty; and so if hard times come, whether they be due to our own fault or to our misfortune, whether they be due to some burst of speculative frenzy that has caused a portion of the business world to lose its head -- a loss which no legislation can possibly supply -- or whether they be due to any lack of wisdom in a portion of the world of labor--in each case, the trouble once started is felt more or less in every walk of life. It is all-essential to the continuance of our healthy national life that we should recognize this community of interest among our people. The welfare of each of us is dependent fundamentally upon the welfare of all of us, and therefore in public life that man is the best representative of each of us who seeks to do good to each by doing good to all; in other words, whose endeavor it is not to represent any special class and promote merely that class's selfish interests, but to represent all true and honest men of all sections and all classes and to work for their interests by working for our common country. We can keep our government on a sane and healthy basis, we can make and keep our social system what it should be, only on condition of judging each man, not as a member of a class, but on his worth as a man. It is an infamous thing in our American life, and fundamentally treacherous to our institutions, to apply to any man any test save that of his personal worth, or to draw between two sets of men any distinction save the distinction of conduct, the distinction that marks off those who do well and wisely from those who do ill and foolishly. There are good citizens and bad citizens in every class as in every locality, and the attitude of decent people toward great public and social questions should be determined, not by the accidental questions of employment or locality, but by those deep-set principles which represent the innermost souls of men. The failure in public and in private life thus to treat each man on his own merits, the recognition of this government as being either for the poor as such or for the rich as such, would prove fatal to our Republic, as such failure and such recognition have always proved fatal in the past to other republics. A healthy republican government must rest upon individuals, not upon classes or sections. As soon as it becomes government by a class or by a section, it departs from the old American ideal."

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:28pm EST
so long x.x

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:28pm EST
but basically it just talks about how there will always be assholes that bring our collective awesome down

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:28pm EST
but we can't judge groups based on the assholishness of a couple guys

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:29pm EST
if we governed based on the few assholes

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:29pm EST
our country would suck

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:30pm EST
and we shouldnt judge based on social class either

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:30pm EST
there are awesome people in every walk of class and those people should be recognized for their awesome

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:31pm EST
he also says somewhere in there that people should not be compared against eachother, we are all so different. We should only be judged in rgards to how well we can obey our communal laws

Steph Dudak February 4, 2013 at 12:32pm EST
so basically he focuses a lot on increasing equality between people and especially between workers

Steph Dudak February 4, 2013 at 12:33pm EST
different kinds of workers

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:33pm EST
pretty much

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:33pm EST
he talks about how all people contribute and if anyone leaves then our country is down the tank

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:34pm EST
but this paragraph is more in response

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:34pm EST
to the moochers

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:34pm EST
the ones who try to live off benefits

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:34pm EST
and other junk

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:37pm EST
at least I think

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:37pm EST
I'm really guessing a lot

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:37pm EST
but it fits

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:37pm EST
so why not?

Steph Dudak February 4, 2013 at 12:38pm EST
haha true

Steph Dudak February 4, 2013 at 12:38pm EST
makes sense i suppose

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:39pm EST
If I knew any actual history, I might be better at this

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:39pm EST
but I have very little context

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:39pm EST
basically what I'd do is think of three things that this president wanted to reform

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:39pm EST
and find a couple quotes in the speech that refer to that

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:40pm EST
then mess with the quotes to relate it to some random event happening now

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:40pm EST
as opposed to trying to actually read

Steph Dudak February 4, 2013 at 12:42pm EST
The Square Deal was President Theodore Roosevelt's domestic program formed upon three basic ideas: conservation of natural resources, control of corporations, and consumer protection.[1] These three demands are often referred to as the "three C's" of Roosevelt's Square Deal. Thus, it aimed at helping middle class citizens and involved attacking plutocracy and bad trusts while at the same time protecting business from the most extreme demands of organized labor. In contrast to his predecessor William McKinley, Roosevelt was a Republican who believed in government action to mitigate social evils, and as president denounced the representatives of predatory wealth as guilty of all forms of iniquity from the oppression of wage workers to defrauding the public.[2]

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:45pm EST
sounds good to me

Steph Dudak February 4, 2013 at 12:48pm EST
i feel like this

Steph Dudak February 4, 2013 at 12:48pm EST
The average American knows not only that he himself intends to do what is right, but that his average fellow countryman has the same intention and the same power to make his intention effective. He knows, whether he be business man, professional man, farmer, mechanic, employer, or wage-worker, that the welfare of each of these men is bound up with the welfare of all the others; that each is neighbor to the other, is actuated by the same hopes and fears, has fundamentally the same ideals, and that all alike have much the same virtues and the same faults.

Steph Dudak February 4, 2013 at 12:48pm EST
is just a general thing that can be applied to today because for some reason i read it in obama's voice since he's always so we're all equal we're all here for the same reason, love each other blahblahblah. all in this together bye

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:49pm EST
just quote high school musical while your at it

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:49pm EST
you could talk about how intricate our society is?

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:49pm EST
like just to make a like pencil

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:49pm EST
takes so many god damn people

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:50pm EST
if one stage shuts down, then we're all outta pencils

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:53pm EST
so if like the tree farmers decide to fuck off and quit

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:54pm EST
or if the guy who designs pencils takes back his copyright

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:54pm EST
etc

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:54pm EST
but in a larger social sense

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:54pm EST
the people who make the food

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:54pm EST
the people who keep roads usable

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:55pm EST
the doctors

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:55pm EST
teachers

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:55pm EST
businessmen

Steph Dudak February 4, 2013 at 12:56pm EST
was that a complete thought

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:56pm EST
ish

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:56pm EST
if you got the idea

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:56pm EST
then that is my complete thought

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:56pm EST
can elaborate more if you wish

Steph Dudak February 4, 2013 at 12:58pm EST
please

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:58pm EST
Everyone is important in society. We all do different things in order to keep society running. But we are all still people that have hopes and dreams.

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:58pm EST
So in his speech he says that

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:58pm EST
which related to his ideal of consumer protection I suppose

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:59pm EST
This message pervades to even today

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:59pm EST
because our society has become extremely specialized

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 12:59pm EST
no one would be able to survive in our society with our level of comfort, if they lived alone

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 1:00pm EST
They need all of society to support them. Teachers to take care of kids. Police to protect Farmers for food Merchants to move around the food Business to organize it all

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 1:01pm EST
As a current event topic

Steph Dudak February 4, 2013 at 1:01pm EST
that was much more clear

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 1:02pm EST
talk about the bus driver strike in new york city

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 1:02pm EST
they seem like an unimprtant job

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 1:02pm EST
but once they all quit, kids couldnt get to school

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 1:02pm EST
parents had to take off work to get kids to school

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 1:02pm EST
all their jobs were affected

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 1:03pm EST
other public transport waqs innundated messing with all their schedules

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 1:03pm EST
teachers had trouble keping kids attention

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 1:03pm EST
just because bus drivers quit

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 1:09pm EST
so just any other current event that is related

Nick Devlin February 4, 2013 at 1:09pm EST
should work fine

Steph Dudak February 4, 2013 at 1:09pm EST

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:44pm EST
plus i am trying to talk to people, but the more i talk to them many getting boring/ dumb

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:44pm EST
so many people drink so much

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:44pm EST
its ridiculous

Steph Dudak February 24, 2013 at 11:45pm EST
yo i know i don't talk to anyone in our group that much really, it's quite sad ): I should put in more effort i understand how you feel though. plenty of those people to go around. and that is college my dear. drinking for days

Steph Dudak February 24, 2013 at 11:45pm EST
literally days

Steph Dudak February 24, 2013 at 11:46pm EST
like wednesday through saturday some people bye

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:46pm EST
oh well, it's better than not knowing anyone

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:46pm EST
I'm makin connections an shit

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:47pm EST
getting cheap trip to cali

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:47pm EST
hopefully

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:47pm EST
and i am sad that we dont talk so much

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:47pm EST
used to be like 5 days a week i pestered

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:47pm EST
you

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:47pm EST
have less homework!

Steph Dudak February 24, 2013 at 11:48pm EST
this semester is real cray with work mainly design since we have like three projects and like not that much time to get them done plus technics which is basically the work equivalent of a D1 class it's nuts

Steph Dudak February 24, 2013 at 11:48pm EST
that is exciting though!

Steph Dudak February 24, 2013 at 11:48pm EST
but yeah

Steph Dudak February 24, 2013 at 11:49pm EST
spring break i prob wont have that much work and i get out may 9th

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:49pm EST
so exciting

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:49pm EST
Oh!

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:50pm EST
...

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:50pm EST
why did i say

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:50pm EST
Oh

Steph Dudak February 24, 2013 at 11:50pm EST
oh?

Steph Dudak February 24, 2013 at 11:50pm EST
hahaha

Steph Dudak February 24, 2013 at 11:50pm EST
i don't know

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:50pm EST
damn

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:50pm EST
i am goin crazy

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:50pm EST
well more crazy

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:50pm EST
OH!

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:51pm EST
its a different oh from before

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:51pm EST
i thought of something new that deserved and oh

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:51pm EST
What classes are you taking this semester

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:51pm EST
I dont think you ever told me

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:51pm EST
and if you did i have a horrid memory

Steph Dudak February 24, 2013 at 11:52pm EST
i'm not sure that i did, i often just complain about them all lol design 2, h american transitions (pls kill me), italian 1, technics of communication, and physics

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:52pm EST
i should get around to taking a physics class

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:52pm EST
maybe this summer

Steph Dudak February 24, 2013 at 11:52pm EST
general physics literally

Steph Dudak February 24, 2013 at 11:53pm EST
im pretty sure

Steph Dudak February 24, 2013 at 11:53pm EST
he doesnt grade based on correctness, but on the work that we do

Steph Dudak February 24, 2013 at 11:53pm EST
because i've gotten no lower than an A on anything and idk what the hell im even doing sometimes

Steph Dudak February 24, 2013 at 11:53pm EST
like in labs

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:53pm EST
thats no fun

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:53pm EST
and what is technics of communication/ american transitions

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:54pm EST
im guessing its a history and tech class

Steph Dudak February 24, 2013 at 11:54pm EST
ugh yes so technics is half computer stuff (photoshop, indesign, maybe illustrator later??) and half actual drawing

Steph Dudak February 24, 2013 at 11:54pm EST
american transitions SUCKS

Steph Dudak February 24, 2013 at 11:55pm EST
its that history class where i need to just write a paper every week on whatever he has us read

Steph Dudak February 24, 2013 at 11:55pm EST
and he talks for an hour every class

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:56pm EST
borring

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:56pm EST
i am so glad i dont see any history classes in my forseeable future

Steph Dudak February 24, 2013 at 11:56pm EST
ugh its so bad because its just a useless history class

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:56pm EST
the technics one sounds fun enough though

Steph Dudak February 24, 2013 at 11:56pm EST
we're not actually LEARNING anything

Steph Dudak February 24, 2013 at 11:56pm EST
and i already hate history

Steph Dudak February 24, 2013 at 11:56pm EST
i have to take architectural history classes in the future those are relevant

Steph Dudak February 24, 2013 at 11:57pm EST
wyatt talking for 50 mins about whatever is not

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:57pm EST
i can see how

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:57pm EST
unfun

Steph Dudak February 24, 2013 at 11:57pm EST
technics is actually not that fun, but its because i have carol. EXCEPT my next project i get to do a thing like draw diagrams and things for how to make smores haha its awesome

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:59pm EST
that sounds awesome

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:59pm EST
i found some sign at school that says free photshop class at some building somewhere

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:59pm EST
not on campus

Nick Devlin February 24, 2013 at 11:59pm EST
ireally wanna check it out

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 12:01am EST
hopefully it's legit cause that'd be a good thing to do

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:01am EST
it would

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 12:01am EST
i really wanna learn illustrator

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 12:01am EST
so bad

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 12:01am EST
i tried to teach myself and it just never worked out

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 12:01am EST
and i dont have time to teach myself now

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:01am EST
yeah i know that feeling

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 12:01am EST
so i hope we do fun things with it at some point

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 12:02am EST
probably havent since i dont recognize it, so i will play it now

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:03am EST
oops

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:03am EST

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:03am EST
but that site is still pretty cool

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 12:03am EST
yes indee di have seen that lol

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:03am EST
i am scrolling through

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:03am EST
there is like one mention of his son every few months

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:05am EST
"some days harder than others, having a coffee in remembrance of my late son."

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:05am EST
first one

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:06am EST
"drinking coffee with my son's widow, just as beautiful as the day he married her"

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 12:06am EST
i dont even know how to feel about that

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:06am EST
and like hundred of tweets

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:06am EST
about coffee in between

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:06am EST
i cant tell if its a joke or no

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:06am EST
not

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:07am EST
"sadly drinking coffee from my #1 DAD coffee mug. I miss him"

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:08am EST
"today would have been another birthday for my sweet angel please always watch for motorcycles"

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:08am EST
and every single answer to a question

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:08am EST
he says "sometimes"

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:08am EST
like 5 of them are real answers

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 12:09am EST
oh jeez one of those things who knows

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:09am EST
"do you know what my son is being for halloween? a ghost, because he decided to drink and drive."

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:09am EST
I can't handle this

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:10am EST
no more coffee dad for me

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 12:11am EST
i feel really bad for laughing at that lol

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:12am EST
i just stared

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:12am EST
and broke a little inside

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 12:16am EST
internet

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 12:16am EST
scary place

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:17am EST
very

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:17am EST
i shouldnt leave homework till the last minue

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 12:17am EST
thats what i say every day

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:17am EST
i've been pretty awesome for a while

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:17am EST
then all my classes got really boring

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:24am EST
oh well

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:24am EST
i think it mght be time to surrender to my homework

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 12:27am EST
might be a good idea

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 12:27am EST
get it done and sleepz

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:27am EST
holy sluck its almost 12:30

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 12:28am EST
where does the time go right

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:28am EST
no idea

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:28am EST
but i could use some access to where ever it does go

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:28am EST
grab me some extra

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 12:29am EST
that'd be great

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:30am EST
one day there will be a slow down button

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:30am EST
I want to be there for it

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 12:31am EST
a pause button would be nice

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:31am EST
i was figuring the slow down button would be adjustable

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:32am EST
depending on how you are feeling

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:32am EST
or for the situation

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:37am EST
alright

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:37am EST
time to pass out

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:37am EST
gnight

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 12:38am EST
good luck with whatever endeavour you are participating in

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 12:38am EST
thank you very much, goodnight!

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 8:22pm EST
NICK

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 8:23pm EST
important question

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:23pm EST
STEPH

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:23pm EST
Hopefully an answer

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 8:23pm EST
do you remember how we did those cylinder stretchouts in bachelors?

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:23pm EST
yep :)

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 8:23pm EST
is it something you can explain to me

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:24pm EST
possibly

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:25pm EST
hmm lemme think for a minute to draw it out and make sure it make sense

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:26pm EST
what kind of cyclider do you need?

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:26pm EST
right cylinder

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:26pm EST
truncated?

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:26pm EST
cone?

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 8:27pm EST
normal cylinder

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:27pm EST
easy

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:31pm EST
Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:31pm EST
draw side and top view

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:32pm EST
the tube part of cilder is a rectangle, height of cylinder X circumference of circle

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:32pm EST
break into equivalent sections to make sure eveything lines up when you glue the circle and tube together

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:32pm EST
to make tabs:

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:33pm EST
rectangle is obvious

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 8:33pm EST
the rectangle is (height)(circumference) thats what youre telling me

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:33pm EST
circle- make a bigger circle, cut little tabs based off the broken up sections

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:33pm EST
hmm yeah

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 8:34pm EST
how do i divide the circle? do i need to make the rectangle first then divide that up into the little sections that i need to score in order to figure tha tout?

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:34pm EST
just make a bunch of center lines

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:34pm EST
cut in half

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:34pm EST
then quarters

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:34pm EST
then eighths

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:34pm EST
usually 16th is best

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:35pm EST
divide the rectangle into 16th as well

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:35pm EST
halves and halves and halves

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:35pm EST
all the lines on circle will match up with rectangle

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 8:37pm EST
im asking because i need to hand draw this

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 8:37pm EST
i have no internet things at my disposal

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:37pm EST
unfun

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:37pm EST
its pretty simple

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:48pm EST
tell me if you have any problems

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 8:50pm EST
womp ill let you know thank you

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:51pm EST
no problem

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:51pm EST
this was probably my favourite class ever

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 8:51pm EST
actually i am researching now into mechanical engineering majors

Steph Dudak February 25, 2013 at 9:36pm EST
oh really

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 9:36pm EST
yeah a litle bit

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 9:36pm EST
they dont really have what i want though :/

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 9:36pm EST
might as well stick to comp sci

Nick Devlin February 25, 2013 at 9:37pm EST
but who knows its an option

Steph Dudak February 27, 2013 at 9:30pm EST
okie so as mr wong says, you want to get rid of the "mess". which is essentially the more complicated part of the problem. in this case it's 1+x-x^3, you have to do a lot with that. so you're going to make 1+x-x^3 = u. that's the first step. 1. 1+x-x^3 = u Now you need to find the derivative of that 2. 1-3x^2 = u' Once you've done that, you need f(u), which really means replace u in the original equation. (That means make 1+x-x^3, u in the original). so that 3. f(u) = u(e^x) theeeen do derive that, you need to use product rule. separate them into two, u and e^x 1. u 3. e^x 2. 1 4. e^x cross multiply and you get ue^x(e^x). this is 4. f'(u) = ue^x(e^x) then you take that and multiply it by u'

Steph Dudak February 27, 2013 at 9:30pm EST
idk if that last part is right

Steph Dudak February 27, 2013 at 9:30pm EST
the very last

Steph Dudak February 27, 2013 at 9:32pm EST
im trying to help someone with math homework homie

Nick Devlin February 27, 2013 at 9:32pm EST
i'm trying to read it

Nick Devlin February 27, 2013 at 9:33pm EST
can you just give me the original problem

Nick Devlin February 27, 2013 at 9:33pm EST
and i will solve it

Nick Devlin February 27, 2013 at 9:33pm EST
and explain how

Steph Dudak February 27, 2013 at 9:33pm EST
(1+X-x^3)e^x

Nick Devlin February 27, 2013 at 9:33pm EST
it's hard to understand what you wrote

Nick Devlin February 27, 2013 at 9:34pm EST
ohh i get what you mean

Steph Dudak February 27, 2013 at 9:34pm EST
am i correct or no?

Steph Dudak February 27, 2013 at 9:35pm EST
and then you multiply f'(u) times u' or

Nick Devlin February 27, 2013 at 9:36pm EST
all right

Nick Devlin February 27, 2013 at 9:37pm EST
what is your answer?

Nick Devlin February 27, 2013 at 9:37pm EST
from doing your steps?

Steph Dudak February 27, 2013 at 9:37pm EST
ue^x(e^x) ( 1-3x^2)

Steph Dudak February 27, 2013 at 9:37pm EST
nothing combined or anything

Nick Devlin February 27, 2013 at 9:37pm EST
no, your answer should be something similar to

Nick Devlin February 27, 2013 at 9:38pm EST
you're going to have addition

Nick Devlin February 27, 2013 at 9:38pm EST
like (-x^3+x+1)·e^x+(1-3x^2)·e^x

Steph Dudak February 27, 2013 at 9:39pm EST
okay but why i was only asking if a certain part i was doing was correct

Nick Devlin February 27, 2013 at 9:39pm EST
i'm trying to find the part where you messed up

Steph Dudak February 27, 2013 at 9:39pm EST
which was 3. f(u) = u(e^x) theeeen do derive that, you need to use product rule. separate them into two, u and e^x 1. u 3. e^x 2. 1 4. e^x cross multiply and you get ue^x(e^x). this is 4. f'(u) = ue^x(e^x) then you take that and multiply it by u' all of that.

Steph Dudak February 27, 2013 at 9:39pm EST
that is the part that i was unsure about. the first two steps are right.

Nick Devlin February 27, 2013 at 9:40pm EST
there's no cross multiplication

Steph Dudak February 27, 2013 at 9:41pm EST
you need to add them dont you

Nick Devlin February 27, 2013 at 9:41pm EST
this isnt a chain rule problem

Nick Devlin February 27, 2013 at 9:41pm EST
its just a product rule

Nick Devlin February 27, 2013 at 9:41pm EST
you're way overcomplicating it

Steph Dudak February 27, 2013 at 9:42pm EST
it's not for me

Steph Dudak February 27, 2013 at 9:42pm EST
someone sent me a problem saying solve with chain rule

Nick Devlin February 27, 2013 at 9:42pm EST
well idk how

Nick Devlin February 27, 2013 at 9:42pm EST
its a product rule problem

Nick Devlin February 27, 2013 at 9:43pm EST
f(x)=(1+X-x^3)e^x h(x)=(1+X-x^3) g(x)=e^x f'(x)=h'(x)g(x)+h(x)g'(x)

Steph Dudak February 27, 2013 at 9:43pm EST
the way i wrote it you would cross multiply it

Steph Dudak February 27, 2013 at 9:44pm EST
it's just simpler to explain

Steph Dudak February 27, 2013 at 9:44pm EST
it's those same principles

Steph Dudak February 27, 2013 at 9:44pm EST
of course add them

Nick Devlin February 27, 2013 at 9:44pm EST
maybe, when you say cross multiply i think fractions

Steph Dudak February 27, 2013 at 9:44pm EST
which i failed to do

Steph Dudak February 27, 2013 at 9:44pm EST
im not going to try to explain it to you

Nick Devlin February 27, 2013 at 9:44pm EST
i read that in my head as like

Nick Devlin February 27, 2013 at 9:44pm EST
I dont gotta explain myself to you

Nick Devlin February 27, 2013 at 9:44pm EST
very angry

Steph Dudak February 27, 2013 at 9:45pm EST
so whats the answer ?

Nick Devlin February 27, 2013 at 9:45pm EST
(-x^3+x+1)·e^x+(1-3x^2)·e^x

Nick Devlin February 27, 2013 at 9:47pm EST
because h'(x)=(1-3x^2) g'(x)=e^x

Steph Dudak February 27, 2013 at 9:47pm EST
i know why

Steph Dudak February 27, 2013 at 9:47pm EST
i wanted to be sure.

Nick Devlin February 27, 2013 at 9:48pm EST
yeah i was just making sure you understood what i was talkin bout too

Nick Devlin March 10, 2013 at 3:31pm EDT

Nick Devlin March 10, 2013 at 3:31pm EDT

Nick Devlin March 10, 2013 at 3:31pm EDT
home stuff: video games, cooking, movies... reading?

Steph Dudak March 10, 2013 at 3:34pm EDT
never progressing towrds those awesome prizes

Steph Dudak March 10, 2013 at 3:34pm EDT

Steph Dudak March 10, 2013 at 3:34pm EDT

Nick Devlin March 10, 2013 at 3:34pm EDT
exactly

Nick Devlin March 10, 2013 at 3:34pm EDT
and bowling is really kinda meh for me, too much money for too little entertainment

Nick Devlin March 10, 2013 at 3:35pm EDT
laughing at each others failures can only last for so long

Nick Devlin March 10, 2013 at 3:35pm EDT
ohh

Nick Devlin March 10, 2013 at 3:35pm EDT
i just remembered something

Nick Devlin March 10, 2013 at 3:35pm EDT
there is an art gallery at occ

Nick Devlin March 10, 2013 at 3:36pm EDT
some of the stuff makes me cry inside

Nick Devlin March 10, 2013 at 3:36pm EDT
because it's the high school competition thing

Steph Dudak March 10, 2013 at 3:37pm EDT
is it good?

Nick Devlin March 10, 2013 at 3:37pm EDT
a lot of them are pretty awesome

Steph Dudak March 10, 2013 at 3:37pm EDT
so that can be a thing then

Nick Devlin March 10, 2013 at 3:37pm EDT
and it'd only take like 10 minutes to look through

Nick Devlin March 10, 2013 at 3:38pm EDT
so if you come to get me at school, we could just look through that before we do whatever i can think of to do

Steph Dudak March 10, 2013 at 3:38pm EDT
that sounds coo then, now to actually think of things.

Steph Dudak March 10, 2013 at 3:38pm EDT
i mean video games are always a good solution

Nick Devlin March 10, 2013 at 3:38pm EDT
they are

Nick Devlin March 10, 2013 at 3:39pm EDT
but they are like a last resort

Nick Devlin March 10, 2013 at 3:39pm EDT
we're gonna end up there eventually

Nick Devlin March 10, 2013 at 3:39pm EDT
but maybe if we think enough we'll hit upon some inspiration

Nick Devlin March 10, 2013 at 3:39pm EDT
i doubt it

Steph Dudak March 10, 2013 at 3:39pm EDT
we can always bake again

Steph Dudak March 10, 2013 at 3:39pm EDT
baking!

Nick Devlin March 10, 2013 at 3:39pm EDT
I just had flashbacks of all the other times I baed with anyone from the movie grou

Nick Devlin March 10, 2013 at 3:43pm EDT
no cup can contain the glory of a cake

Nick Devlin March 10, 2013 at 3:43pm EDT

Steph Dudak March 10, 2013 at 3:43pm EDT

Nick Devlin March 10, 2013 at 4:34pm EDT
so rich will take care of all that?

Steph Dudak March 10, 2013 at 4:34pm EDT

Nick Devlin March 10, 2013 at 4:34pm EDT
funfun I wont include it in any of my calculation then

Nick Devlin March 14, 2013 at 7:33pm EDT
he's an odd one

Nick Devlin March 14, 2013 at 7:37pm EDT
8589934592

Nick Devlin March 14, 2013 at 7:38pm EDT
8589934592

Steph Dudak March 14, 2013 at 9:00pm EDT
excuse

Nick Devlin March 14, 2013 at 9:03pm EDT
sorry

Nick Devlin March 14, 2013 at 9:04pm EDT
couldnt find a place to copy paste

Nick Devlin March 14, 2013 at 9:04pm EDT
this was open

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 12:03pm EDT
I hate

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 12:04pm EDT
when I'm assigned to analyze poems and short stories

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 12:04pm EDT
in terms of a certain literary device

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 12:04pm EDT
like plot or symbolism or irony

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 12:04pm EDT
But the given piece of work

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 12:04pm EDT
is a terrible example of that device

Steph Dudak March 19, 2013 at 12:35pm EDT
i am very sorry

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 4:19pm EDT
thank you

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 4:19pm EDT
i appreciate the pity

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 4:20pm EDT
How did you enjoy the rest of your break?

Steph Dudak March 19, 2013 at 6:43pm EDT
aside from being sick it was good i suppose. didn't really do any of my work over break but its coo

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 8:38pm EDT
well hopefully it was relaxing

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 8:38pm EDT
you were basically forced to not do anything

Steph Dudak March 19, 2013 at 8:39pm EDT
no i had work to do that i didnt do til sunday night lol

Steph Dudak March 19, 2013 at 8:39pm EDT
its okay tho cuz got it done

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 8:39pm EDT
thats good

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 8:39pm EDT
I got some work i;m ignoring right now

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 8:39pm EDT
that thing i was complaining about before

Steph Dudak March 19, 2013 at 8:40pm EDT
merh

Steph Dudak March 19, 2013 at 8:41pm EDT
sometimes you need to ignore work

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 8:41pm EDT
exactly

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 8:45pm EDT
hmm i think

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 8:45pm EDT
i;m gonna ignore what she wants us to talk about

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 8:45pm EDT
have you ever read the robert frost poem?

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 8:45pm EDT
the road not taken

Steph Dudak March 19, 2013 at 8:48pm EDT
ive heard of it

Steph Dudak March 19, 2013 at 8:48pm EDT
actually

Steph Dudak March 19, 2013 at 8:49pm EDT
i heard it on suite life of zack and cody

Steph Dudak March 19, 2013 at 8:49pm EDT
part of it

Steph Dudak March 19, 2013 at 8:50pm EDT
and i just read the whole thing SUP

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:02pm EDT
fhdusil

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:02pm EDT
umm

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:02pm EDT
what was i gonna say

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:02pm EDT
OH!

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:02pm EDT
I just read it again

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:02pm EDT
And normally people are all like, "This is a story about how taking the less traveled path is important

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:02pm EDT
and it made my life so much better"

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:03pm EDT
thats what it reads like yeah?

Steph Dudak March 19, 2013 at 9:04pm EDT
YEAH

Steph Dudak March 19, 2013 at 9:05pm EDT
oops

Steph Dudak March 19, 2013 at 9:05pm EDT
yeah

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:06pm EDT
well when i read it again

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:07pm EDT
i actually read it instead of assuming i remembered it right

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:07pm EDT
and the dude is completely lying at the end!

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:07pm EDT
"Though as for that the passing there	 Had worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally lay	 In leaves no step had trodden black."

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:07pm EDT
LOOK!

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:08pm EDT
He SAYS that they are exactly the same

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:08pm EDT
and the last three lines

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:08pm EDT
the ones every looks at, while ignoring the rest of the poem

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:08pm EDT
"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I	 I took the one less traveled by,	 And that has made all the difference."

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:08pm EDT
that what everyone judges based on

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:08pm EDT
RIGHT BEFORE

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:09pm EDT
He says "I shall be telling this with a sigh	 Somewhere ages and ages hence:"

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:09pm EDT
He's gonna tell a tale, a story, he basically made it up!

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:09pm EDT
And he says it with a sigh, like he is lying to himself

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:09pm EDT
bastard, trying to trick people

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:10pm EDT
so he is just trying to justify his decision

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:10pm EDT
to make himself seem cool, like some kind of trailblazing hero

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:10pm EDT
but really they were the same choice, and really, his route might have even been worse, and he'll never know

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:10pm EDT
he never says it was a good difference after all

Steph Dudak March 19, 2013 at 9:10pm EDT
http://www.gradesaver.com/the-poetry-of-robert-frost/study-guide/section11/

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:10pm EDT
i just thought it was weid that no on ever notices that

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:13pm EDT
THOSE BASTARDS

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:13pm EDT
I thought of it first!

Steph Dudak March 19, 2013 at 9:13pm EDT
riiiiiight

Steph Dudak March 19, 2013 at 9:13pm EDT
lol

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:13pm EDT
ughhh

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:14pm EDT
this is worse than that time i thought i was the first person to think that "what if every elses green is different from my green in their head"

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:14pm EDT
then i found out that was like the most common philosophical question ever -.-

Steph Dudak March 19, 2013 at 9:15pm EDT
oh nicholas

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:15pm EDT
so dissapointing

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:15pm EDT
oh well

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:16pm EDT
this is why i deserve for not looking up stuff on the internet first!

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:17pm EDT
anyway, now that my life is ruined

Nick Devlin March 19, 2013 at 9:17pm EDT
whatre you up to?

Nick Devlin April 4, 2013 at 12:06am EDT
dying

Nick Devlin April 4, 2013 at 12:06am EDT

Steph Dudak April 4, 2013 at 12:06am EDT
why

Nick Devlin April 4, 2013 at 12:06am EDT
tired

Nick Devlin April 4, 2013 at 12:06am EDT

Steph Dudak April 4, 2013 at 12:08am EDT
booooo

Nick Devlin April 4, 2013 at 12:08am EDT
mhmm

Nick Devlin April 4, 2013 at 12:08am EDT
at least their super easy to figure out

Nick Devlin April 4, 2013 at 12:08am EDT
but still

Nick Devlin April 4, 2013 at 12:08am EDT
brain

Nick Devlin April 4, 2013 at 12:08am EDT
sad

Nick Devlin April 4, 2013 at 12:12am EDT
why are you awake?

Nick Devlin April 4, 2013 at 12:12am EDT

Steph Dudak April 4, 2013 at 12:14am EDT

Steph Dudak April 4, 2013 at 12:14am EDT
i have physics homework to do

Nick Devlin April 4, 2013 at 12:14am EDT
ahh

Nick Devlin April 4, 2013 at 12:14am EDT
gotchu

Steph Dudak April 4, 2013 at 12:14am EDT
like three sheets

Nick Devlin April 4, 2013 at 12:14am EDT
sounds delightful

Steph Dudak April 4, 2013 at 12:14am EDT
it isn't

Steph Dudak April 4, 2013 at 12:14am EDT
let me show you this one question

Steph Dudak April 4, 2013 at 12:16am EDT
a 50 kg hiker starts at an elevation of 2500m and climbs to the top of a 3500m mountain in 4 hrs. A) what was the work done by the hiker? B) what was his power output in watts? C) what was his power output in horse power? (1 hp = 750 watts)

Steph Dudak April 4, 2013 at 12:16am EDT
oh okay uppercase b) is a smiley

Steph Dudak April 4, 2013 at 12:16am EDT
not a hard problem but why

Steph Dudak April 4, 2013 at 12:16am EDT
is the hiker a car or some sort of electrical thing

Steph Dudak April 4, 2013 at 12:16am EDT
i don't understand

Nick Devlin April 4, 2013 at 12:17am EDT
is the hitchiker a car

Nick Devlin April 4, 2013 at 12:17am EDT
wel

Nick Devlin April 4, 2013 at 12:17am EDT
it seems the questions havent gotten any better

Nick Devlin April 4, 2013 at 12:17am EDT
since high school

Nick Devlin April 4, 2013 at 12:18am EDT
such weird things to ask

Steph Dudak April 4, 2013 at 12:18am EDT
IT MAKES NO SENSE UNLESS HE'S A CAR I DON'T SEE WHY I'M CALCULATING HIS WORK IN WATTS AND HORSEPOWER ailable from the flow of water over the dam at the art museum. Water has a density of 1g/cubic cm=1000kg/cubic meter

Steph Dudak April 4, 2013 at 12:18am EDT
excuse me

Nick Devlin April 4, 2013 at 12:18am EDT
excused

Steph Dudak April 4, 2013 at 12:18am EDT
sorry half that question

Steph Dudak April 4, 2013 at 12:18am EDT
got cut off

Nick Devlin April 4, 2013 at 12:18am EDT
maybe the hiker want to BE a car

Nick Devlin April 4, 2013 at 12:18am EDT
and he wants to know how fast he would be after the operation

Steph Dudak April 4, 2013 at 12:18am EDT
estimate the power available from the flow of water over the dam at the art museum. Water has a density of 1g/cubic cm=1000kg/cubic meter

Steph Dudak April 4, 2013 at 12:22am EDT
let me estimate that for you

Steph Dudak April 4, 2013 at 12:22am EDT
stupid

Nick Devlin April 4, 2013 at 12:26am EDT
very stupid

Nick Devlin April 4, 2013 at 12:26am EDT
i am sorry

Steph Dudak April 12, 2013 at 9:41pm EDT
i have decided that i am bad at writing papers and can never seem to make a decision on some sort of thesis.

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:16pm EDT
what is the current issue?

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:17pm EDT
Also I slept last night!!! Went to bed at like 10 I have slept in like 2 weeks

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:17pm EDT
was awesome

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:18pm EDT
i was having problems developing where my paper was actually going last night

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:18pm EDT
proud of you!

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:18pm EDT
did you figure out a thesis?

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:19pm EDT
i don't really know. i have this thing Architecture is widely recognized as the designing and construction of buildings. Other things architecture is associated with is right angled walls, traditional rectilinear shapes, and structures that clearly show functionality upon looking at themup until the end of the Modernist movement of architecture, that is. In the 1980s there is a break in this style of architecture where a movement known as Deconstructivism comes into effect, giving architecture new meaning beyond traditional expectations and structures, changing the way we view architecture today.

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:21pm EDT
and i have like a list of things i want to talk about like - talk about modern architecture (not crazy in depth. just what it entails really) - talk about what deconstructivism is (form of post modern architecture) - mostly talk about it relating to the united states - talk about prominent decon buildings here - talk about prominent decon architects (perhaps Daniel Libeskind Thom Mayne Rem Koolhaas Coop Himmelblau maybe two of them in depth, and then the others in mentioning when i talk about the buildings) - talk about libeskind last because he helps kind of shape what i want to say in that i really want to quote him saying "I think architecture should be risky. . . It should not play it safe because if it plays it safe it is not moving us in the direction that we want to be. And I think, of course, risk is what underlies the world. [A] world without risk would not be worth living." because his views on architecture help my paper and help what deconstructivism is. - then ultimately the effect deconstructivism has on people and how we experience it now

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:21pm EDT
hmmm

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:22pm EDT
you want to write an essay on the transition of traditional to modern american architecture?

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:23pm EDT
i want to talk about a specific movement of architecture that being deconstructivism

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:24pm EDT
but

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:24pm EDT
i can't just talk about it

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:24pm EDT
and in order to describe deconstructivism you need to discuss traditional

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:24pm EDT
gotcha

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:24pm EDT
yes

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:25pm EDT
that's why that last sentence of that paragraph is the way it is kind of because ifeel like it kind of gets at something but perhaps it's underdeveloped?

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:25pm EDT
alright so why did people transition into deconstructivism?

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:28pm EDT
it didn't come into play til the 1980s, it was influenced by Jacques Derrida, a french philosopher as well as Russian Constructivism (art movement, dealt a lot with geometry). but it really came out cause of the 1982 Parc de la Villette architectural design competition. it's a competition to revitalize undeveloped land from the French national wholesale meat market in Paris. that was like the first time you really began seeing "deconstructivist" architecture. the people involved in the competition included eisenman, rem koolhaas, zaha hadid. who are all well known as deconstructivists

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:28pm EDT
(althought they may not describe themselves as such)

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:30pm EDT
So there were no external social events that cause deconstructivism to get started? A couple guys thought it was cool and others followed

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:30pm EDT
There wasnt like any cultural revolutions or nothing taking place?

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:30pm EDT
i dont know any history so thats why i ask

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:35pm EDT
no not really it wasn't a thing that people were like "yeah i'm gonna be a deconstructivist! this is a thing i'm going to do!" it just kind of became and grew as it's own thing. like the thing about it that separates it from other architecture is Deconstructivism is characterized by fragmentation and controlled chaos. it does not appear to be logical. This style focuses on complexity and manipulating a structure, and it includes non-rectilinear shapes that seem to distort elements of conventional architecture. Another common characteristic of deconstructive architecture is its ability to invoke emotion in people experiencing it. If you look at Libeskind's Jewish Berlin museum or his Danish Jewish museum in Copenhagen. it isn't just a building. it's designed to make you feel a certain way when you experience it.

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:36pm EDT
is that the squiggly building?

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:36pm EDT
the berlin museum,

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:37pm EDT
zig zag shaped yee

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:37pm EDT
yeah

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:37pm EDT
either way not too important

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:38pm EDT
hmm this is a difficult topic to write about

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:38pm EDT
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/JewishMuseumBerlinAerial.jpg/300px-JewishMuseumBerlinAerial.jpg belin http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/DanishMuseumInterior.jpg/220px-DanishMuseumInterior.jpg danish it's not a difficult topic to write about

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:38pm EDT
deconstructivism is quite easy actually

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:38pm EDT
it would be for me, but you seem to know a lot about it so that's pretty good

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:40pm EDT
it's quite easy to write about actually. there's plenty of information i've gathered as well as plenty of awesome architects to talk about (not a surprise that most of these deconstructivist architects are my favorites)

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:40pm EDT
are you going to discuss the philosophy behind decon?

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:40pm EDT
there seems to be a lot of that

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:40pm EDT
considering it's influenced by a french philosopher i feel like ishould

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:41pm EDT
yeah everything I google starts talking about philosophy

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:42pm EDT
well yeah but it's also not solely that. i have plenty on what it is. that's why i wrote that one paragraph how i did because it does change what people expect of architecture

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:42pm EDT
Is that paragraph your draft intro

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:42pm EDT
and it brings it into how we look at it today, especially since decon is fairly recent

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:43pm EDT
lol drafts don't exist in this class. but of course i'll be editing when needed

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:43pm EDT
i'm pretty much just trying to write everything out and then go back and fix

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:43pm EDT
good plan

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:44pm EDT
ofjust let me know when you want a final edit and I can go through

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:45pm EDT
thanks however it is like a six page paper

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:46pm EDT
that's why i was just trying to figure that all out but i don't believe the way i'm going about it is really too broad but it's not crazy specific either

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:47pm EDT
nothing you've said seems to be too baod

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:47pm EDT
broad*

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:47pm EDT
and I nuderstood most of it as well, so its not like architecture jargon

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:47pm EDT
nuderstood

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:47pm EDT
nunderstood haha

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:47pm EDT
-.-

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:52pm EDT
i'm going to use this as additional work space, i hope you don't mind. there's a lot of things that need rewording Derridean deconstruction consists in an attempt to re-conceive the difference that divides self-reflection (or self-consciousness)

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:52pm EDT
no problem

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:53pm EDT
in --> of

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:53pm EDT
that was copy and pasted

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:53pm EDT
i didn't write that is what i'm saying

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:53pm EDT
lol

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:53pm EDT
not my fault they were wrong

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:56pm EDT
Derridean deconstruction consists of an attempt to re-conceive the difference that divides self-reflection (or self-consciousness) "the difference that divides self-consciousness"

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:56pm EDT
what does that mean

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:59pm EDT
context por favor

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 1:59pm EDT
where did you get the quote from

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:59pm EDT
http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/derrida/

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:59pm EDT
first paragraph

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 1:59pm EDT
that part i put in quotes, the whole thing is write above it

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 2:04pm EDT
mm

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 2:10pm EDT
got it

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 2:10pm EDT
took some digging

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 2:12pm EDT
Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 2:13pm EDT
self love and self knowledge

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 2:13pm EDT
is my best bet as to what that means

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 2:15pm EDT
so essentially

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 2:15pm EDT
could i just reword what i showed you before to say

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 2:15pm EDT
His form of deconstruction was meant to understand self-consciousness and what divides it.

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 2:15pm EDT
i only need a basic thing

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 2:15pm EDT
Thats an accurate rewording

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 2:16pm EDT
reflection might be a better word than conciousness, but thats semantics

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 2:18pm EDT
okie

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 2:18pm EDT
yeah i'll use reflection

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 2:24pm EDT
also

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 2:24pm EDT
just sayin

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 2:24pm EDT
i'm citing this whole thing in chicago style

Steph Dudak April 13, 2013 at 2:24pm EDT
much nicer than MLA

Nick Devlin April 13, 2013 at 2:27pm EDT
fancy

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:37pm EDT
STEPPPHHHH

Steph Dudak May 3, 2013 at 4:38pm EDT
NICCCKKKK

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:39pm EDT
IT WAS AWFUL

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:39pm EDT
I didnt have the internet and kept having to study or do homework

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:40pm EDT
AND YOU ALL DID SO MUCH

Steph Dudak May 3, 2013 at 4:40pm EDT
that's what happens nicholas lol

Steph Dudak May 3, 2013 at 4:41pm EDT
i am very sorry

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:44pm EDT
I just made my mom read that excerpt

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:44pm EDT
she laughed and said that her book are not actually like that

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:45pm EDT
they have better vocab

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:45pm EDT
she's weird

Steph Dudak May 3, 2013 at 4:45pm EDT
so are you

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:46pm EDT
makes sense

Steph Dudak May 3, 2013 at 4:46pm EDT
you made your mom read that excerpt think about that

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:46pm EDT
I suppose that could be considered weird

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:46pm EDT
Well i suppose it just is

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:47pm EDT
oh well

Steph Dudak May 3, 2013 at 4:47pm EDT
haha

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:48pm EDT
I really don't think I've cared about what I share with my mom, I link her to like holocaust jokes sometimes

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:48pm EDT
and antireligion jokes

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:48pm EDT
hmmm maybe I should start censoring stuff

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:48pm EDT
nah

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:48pm EDT
SO

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:49pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 3, 2013 at 4:49pm EDT
i'm unfortunately still alive i got a B+ on my project bc no section perspective while Peter got an A- and didn't have half of his drawings goodbye betty. but i'm not complaining about that again because it makes me angry

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:50pm EDT
good plan, angry is no fun

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:50pm EDT
and people just suck sometimes

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:50pm EDT
a lot of the time

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:50pm EDT
...all the time

Steph Dudak May 3, 2013 at 4:50pm EDT
you can see it when my portfolios done because i have two portfolios to make, i need to print them, i need to update both digication pages, write two essays for history, and then i have a physics final on the 7th

Steph Dudak May 3, 2013 at 4:50pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:51pm EDT
Is every year gonna be this intense?

Steph Dudak May 3, 2013 at 4:51pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:51pm EDT
oh god poor rich

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:51pm EDT

i need to get a job

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:56pm EDT
Any idea where?

Steph Dudak May 3, 2013 at 4:56pm EDT
nope just somewhere within walking/biking distance to my house. julie told me to call the people at her work but i'm not trying to work in lavalette because i don't have a car and would have to depend on people and that's not what i'm trying to do

Steph Dudak May 3, 2013 at 4:57pm EDT
i'll probably end up applying to michaels

Steph Dudak May 3, 2013 at 4:58pm EDT
i told my mother to let me know of places since she's obviously home and i'm not

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:58pm EDT
Good idea, it's not fun depending on people for work. and michaels doesnt sound to bad.

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:58pm EDT
too*

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:58pm EDT
You car still isnt functional?

Steph Dudak May 3, 2013 at 4:58pm EDT
that things been gone for a while

Steph Dudak May 3, 2013 at 4:58pm EDT
it's functional

Steph Dudak May 3, 2013 at 4:59pm EDT
sold it to a kid up the street and he put like $4k into it anddd it's got like a bagillion miles on it and is a piece of shit still

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:59pm EDT
oh, I never heard anything about it since you had the problem with it working

Steph Dudak May 3, 2013 at 4:59pm EDT
so he can have fun with that

Steph Dudak May 3, 2013 at 4:59pm EDT
it was never working

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 4:59pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 3, 2013 at 4:59pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 5:00pm EDT
Well I haven't met him, but I trust your judgement

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 5:15pm EDT
Good luck with all your stuff. Wish I was still useful so that maybe I could help in some way. If you think of something let me know!

Steph Dudak May 3, 2013 at 5:15pm EDT
i mean you could totally do my history papers for me!

Steph Dudak May 3, 2013 at 5:15pm EDT
just kidding haha

Steph Dudak May 3, 2013 at 5:16pm EDT
yeeeah thanks, hopefully i get through it all with minimal death threats

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 5:16pm EDT
I'd be more than happy to edit them! Practice for my new job next year :D

Steph Dudak May 3, 2013 at 5:16pm EDT
i don't even know what i'm going to write yet, i've barely looked at the prompts but i'll let you know if i need help

Steph Dudak May 3, 2013 at 5:16pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 3, 2013 at 5:16pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 3, 2013 at 5:21pm EDT
youre awesome and you dont die either!

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 2:28pm EDT
so the best question anyone can ever ask me is "what is your greatest accomplishment" cause it's at that moment that i forget everything i've ever achieved

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:28pm EDT
i think it's the "best" part

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:28pm EDT
that screw you over

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:29pm EDT
what is best?!

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:29pm EDT
for future reference though

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:29pm EDT
when people ask you youre answer should be "I met Nick Devlin"

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:30pm EDT
that should make life easier

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:32pm EDT
who asked?

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 2:33pm EDT
proudest, whatever job application

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:33pm EDT
where are you applying?

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 2:34pm EDT
marshalls, homegoods, for right now i thought about michaels but idk lol i just neeed a job for the summer soo yeah

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 2:34pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:34pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:34pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:34pm EDT
...your*

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 2:34pm EDT
no i'm trying to think of one lol

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 2:35pm EDT
like i've done things im sure

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 2:35pm EDT
i got perfect attendance for all four years of highschool, i've gotten plenty of academic awards. i mean. i went to college and successfully completed a year of architecture school. that's a pretty legit accomplishment But i dunno they seem boring lol

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:36pm EDT
hmmm, pick something that like

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:36pm EDT
shows good traits

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:37pm EDT
like finishing a year of school

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:37pm EDT
In order to do that

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:37pm EDT
you need organization and dedication and attendance

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:37pm EDT
and it shows that you value that stuff

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:37pm EDT
otherwise you wouldnt be proud of it

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:38pm EDT
you could do the same for any project youve done in architecture or design. And award or scholarship you ever got

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:38pm EDT
and just list the good qualities you needed to accomplish that goal

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:38pm EDT
so that they think youre awesome!

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:45pm EDT
or something random i dunno how important that question is

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 2:46pm EDT
right sorry yeah that's a good answer though lol i linked my perf attendance with architecture school and how i value time and attendance and all this junk because of it. whateva thanks yo

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:46pm EDT
sounds good to me

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 2:46pm EDT
"least favorite thing to do each day" does not exist

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:47pm EDT
"writing resumes"

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 2:48pm EDT
lets not lol

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 2:48pm EDT
but i honestly don't have a favorite thing that i do each day because i don't mind doing the things i do. especially considering I know they have to be done and I know the reason for why they need to be. stupid.

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:49pm EDT
yeah i don't really have an answer to that either

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:49pm EDT
hmm

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:49pm EDT
waking up early?

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 2:49pm EDT
nope because i want morning times lol

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:49pm EDT
yeah that might not work

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 2:50pm EDT
applies for hours in the morning appears to hate waking up early declined

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:50pm EDT
they'd appreciate your honesty i'm sure though

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:50pm EDT
i hate when I have to leave work I just love it so much that I never wanna stop

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 2:51pm EDT
hahaha

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 2:51pm EDT
theyd appreciate your ability to suck up

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 2:55pm EDT
favorite thing is how i have 0 work experience

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 2:57pm EDT
and these things are too specific for volunteer work bye

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 3:00pm EDT
thats really annoying

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 3:00pm EDT
i'm gonna try to throw it in there anyway cause i did a bunch of stupid volunteer work, mainly the library stuff

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 3:00pm EDT
but i don't quite remember the months i did SAIL

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 3:01pm EDT
like what days they were? Or what you did

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 3:01pm EDT
month/year i remember the things i did

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 3:01pm EDT
well it was probably summer 2012

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 3:01pm EDT
nope

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 3:01pm EDT
well yes i did it twice

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 3:01pm EDT
2011*

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 3:02pm EDT
because I was in it the year after junior

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 3:02pm EDT
and you went to the party

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 3:02pm EDT
and kevin was there

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 3:02pm EDT
yeah and that was the last one i was allowed to do

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 3:02pm EDT
if i recall correctly

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 3:02pm EDT
yep

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 3:02pm EDT
so i did summer 2010/2011

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 3:02pm EDT
no high school graduates allowed :'(

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 3:02pm EDT
but i dont remember what month

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 3:02pm EDT
hmmm probably july or august, do you have your little certificates?

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 3:03pm EDT
maybe somewhere

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 3:03pm EDT
Just say July

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 3:03pm EDT
i doubt it matters much

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 3:04pm EDT
especially since it's a started ended field to fill in. the thing says "ARE YOU SUREYOU WANNA SKIP THIS?? EVEN ENTERING VOLUNTEER WORK IS A GOD IDEA YOU KNOW" they should have a separate section for htat.

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 3:05pm EDT
i suppose, if they are just looking to see if you can have an assignment and complete it

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 3:05pm EDT
outside of school

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 3:05pm EDT
it dont matter if its paid or not

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 3:05pm EDT
whatever makes them happy

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 3:06pm EDT
sail was what, two weeks?

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 3:06pm EDT
yes

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 3:06pm EDT
there was also TAB and reading buddies if you ever did any of those

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 3:07pm EDT
i didn't really do reading buddies but i had to do that once during sail i suppose reading with a child i wasn't a real reading buddy though haha

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 3:07pm EDT
i'd include TAB if i went to more than 2 meetings

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 3:07pm EDT
that makes sense

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 3:12pm EDT
hmm school clubs?

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 3:12pm EDT
the volunteer stuff for

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 3:12pm EDT
like whatever you did

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 3:12pm EDT
that was a lot of stuff

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 3:13pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 3:13pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 3:33pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 11:28pm EDT
or he thought he did

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 11:28pm EDT
until I reminded him that I yelled at him for leaving it on the counter and he put it in his pocket

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 11:28pm EDT
-.-

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 11:29pm EDT
just felt you should be aware in case he forget to mention it :)

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 11:29pm EDT
youre so thoughtful :P

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 11:29pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 11:32pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 11:32pm EDT
I feel like i knew this at some point

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 11:32pm EDT
you definitely did

Steph Dudak May 9, 2013 at 11:32pm EDT
it's okay

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 11:32pm EDT
thank you

Nick Devlin May 9, 2013 at 11:32pm EDT
oh well I should be able to retain the info this time

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 12:54pm EDT
so i just want to complain to you because you are an unbiased person to discuss these issues with but my friend sean who was in my design class again this semester is annoyed that he got a B for the semester

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 12:55pm EDT
I am very unbiased :)

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 12:55pm EDT
is Sean the one that did nothing?

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 12:55pm EDT
because he thinks he should have a higher grade i kind of agree with the grade that betty gave him, his work wasn't thrilling this semester

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 12:55pm EDT
he did things

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 12:55pm EDT
i can send you his portfolio later

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 12:55pm EDT
but

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 12:57pm EDT
yeah

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 12:57pm EDT
i understand

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 12:57pm EDT
i think

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 12:57pm EDT
maybe

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 12:57pm EDT
betty often does this thing too where she'll give a certain grade to push you to do better you know. like mid semester.

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 12:57pm EDT
and he's all

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 12:57pm EDT
wah wahwha "ugh i hate it when she does this shit you want to push me? give me an A- and expect me to hold that grade because I am very good at doing that she knows that too ughhhh and it pisses me off that she didnt like my portfolio when Haley and Peter got a better grade on it than me. They had no graphic design element to threirs at all. It was all white space and photographs"

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 12:57pm EDT
but he didn't deserve an A-

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 12:59pm EDT
thats silly

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 12:59pm EDT
and congrats on your gps!

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 12:59pm EDT
:)

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:00pm EDT
i see you making fun of my spelling error haha thank you !

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:00pm EDT
this btw

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:00pm EDT
nooooo

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:01pm EDT
did he paint it?

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:02pm EDT
no it's a conceptual drawing we had to do for a project as his background for the things

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:02pm EDT
you'll see the full one later in the portfolio

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:03pm EDT
no I mean like the first page

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:03pm EDT
with the lines

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:03pm EDT
yes

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:03pm EDT
that's also from that drawing

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:03pm EDT
gotcha

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:03pm EDT
and is there a reason he used no punctuation?

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:03pm EDT
he did it in ink on mylar

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:03pm EDT
uh

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:03pm EDT
i dunno lol

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:04pm EDT
there's punctuation?

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:05pm EDT
No capitilization

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:05pm EDT
sorry

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:05pm EDT
also he was an idiot and did the whole thing in photoshop instead of indesign. that's not a big deal. personal taste kind of thing

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:06pm EDT
betty's also a fan of lowercase clean fonts and such

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:06pm EDT
whatevers makes him happy i guess

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:06pm EDT
hmm interesting

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:06pm EDT
i also didn't capitalize, out of habit whenever we need to label things and such

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:06pm EDT
it's lowercase

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:06pm EDT
interesting. I dunno I've just been editing papers a lot and it like made me cringe a little

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:07pm EDT
understandable lol

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:08pm EDT
But yeah I dunno it looked fine to me, Not AWESOME but still coolish

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:08pm EDT
the only thing I really noticed was the glass stairs

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:10pm EDT
it's just dumb he's annoyed because he doesn't have a better grade but he deserves the grade he got. he's comparing his portfolio to hayley and peter's because theirs are just simple, white with photos and such. but he fails to realize that they also probably did better on every project than him

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:11pm EDT
peter got an A- on the final project, they both got and A-on the house project

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:11pm EDT
never compare yourself to others always a bad idea

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:11pm EDT
hayley was one of the top three favorite conceptual drawings of betty's

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:11pm EDT
her mondo was great too

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:11pm EDT
he fails to look at all of this

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:11pm EDT
silly

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:11pm EDT
he got a B on nearly everything

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:11pm EDT
Who was the guy

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:11pm EDT
that had the buildings on the slope

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:11pm EDT
evan?

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:12pm EDT
Maybe?

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:12pm EDT
yes

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:12pm EDT
He was right behind you

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:12pm EDT
yes evan

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:12pm EDT
That one was really cool to me

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:12pm EDT
And he had all the little tiny things

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:12pm EDT
his was great

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:13pm EDT
i have no idea what he got on that project but it better have been in the A-/A range. everything he produced was beautiful and he did a great job presenting

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:13pm EDT
Thats good

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:14pm EDT
I was scared that his was actually like cliche and garbage and i had no taste

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:14pm EDT
no i really liked his project also

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:14pm EDT
Did you bring yours home?

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:14pm EDT
no i didn't

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:15pm EDT
it'll be gone forever, all i have is the photos

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:15pm EDT
there wasn't enough room in the car for that and the house model and i didn't want it that badly either.

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:15pm EDT
what happened to it!

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:15pm EDT
i left it on the table in the studi

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:15pm EDT
o

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:15pm EDT
I wouldve totally jacked it

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:15pm EDT
my parents thought it was a good idea to take my mothers car to pack my things

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:16pm EDT
everything just barely fit

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:16pm EDT
I hate when I see super awesome projects and art just left to get thrown out

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:16pm EDT
There's tons of stuff in the ceramics rooms here just hidden where no one will see

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 1:16pm EDT
and it makes me sad

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:16pm EDT
i didn't want to leave it but what am i going to do with something that's 32 stacked pieces of cardboard high and almost as big as the original model lol

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:16pm EDT
eventually i'll have to get rid of these things

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 1:17pm EDT
i can't keep every model i make for the next four years

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 2:01pm EDT
YES YOU CAN!!!

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 2:02pm EDT
You'll need them when you have your museum exhibit!

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 2:02pm EDT
I've got this all planned out!

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 2:02pm EDT
youre ruining it!

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 2:02pm EDT
I'll rent one of those garage storage places

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 2:02pm EDT
it'll be like that Cave of mysteries from aladdin

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 2:03pm EDT
but with lots of basswood and cardboard

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 2:16pm EDT
hahaha darn im sorry

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 2:18pm EDT
its okay

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 2:18pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 2:18pm EDT
also budgets are hard

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 2:18pm EDT
I'm trying to make one for my life to see what I spend and what I make

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 2:19pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 2:19pm EDT
I need to start keeping those

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 2:19pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 10, 2013 at 2:19pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 2:21pm EDT
Nick Devlin May 10, 2013 at 2:21pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 11, 2013 at 10:48pm EDT
rich wants to know if y'alls job pays over or under the table

Nick Devlin May 12, 2013 at 12:29am EDT
what does that mean?

Steph Dudak May 12, 2013 at 12:46am EDT
getting paid under the table means you keep everything you earn, no taxes and such

Nick Devlin May 12, 2013 at 12:47am EDT
there are taxes

Steph Dudak May 12, 2013 at 10:54am EDT
I DID NOT LOSE MY SOCIAL SECURITY CARD I FOUND IT THANK THE HEAVENS

Nick Devlin May 23, 2013 at 12:46pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 23, 2013 at 12:46pm EDT

Nick Devlin May 23, 2013 at 12:48pm EDT
is sims like one world you play in?

Nick Devlin May 23, 2013 at 12:48pm EDT
or can you make multiple save slots or whatever

Steph Dudak May 23, 2013 at 12:49pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 23, 2013 at 12:49pm EDT

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 12:37am EDT
You are doing an inventory of store merchandise and have been working for over 15 minutes on a complex counting task that requires your full concentration. A customer stops you and requests help in getting something down from a high shelf. Which of the following would you most likely do? Stop doing the task and go help the customer, knowing that you will have to re-start the task from the beginning when you come back. Ask the customer to wait just a minute and promise that you will help when you finish the task. Tell the customer that you are unable to help at the moment, but that another associate should come by in a few moments who can provide assistance. Ask a co-worker to do the task while you help the customer.

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 12:37am EDT
will i honestly have to restart it? come on. i'm not dumb. and if a customer interrupted me, well then surely by that logic i must restart now

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 12:38am EDT
so i might as well help them get the damn thing they cant reach

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 12:38am EDT
i'm pretty sure customer service always comes first

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 12:38am EDT
so yeah

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 12:39am EDT
You have been asked to create a display of seasonal merchandise by the end of your shift. However, you realize that you won't be able to finish the work in time at the rate you are going. Which of the following would you most likely do? Ask your supervisor if you can finish the work when you come back to work the next day. Start working faster. Ask a coworker for help. Stay after your shift ends and work overtime to get the job done. "Start working faster" lol

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 12:39am EDT
where is this for?

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 12:40am EDT

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 12:41am EDT

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 12:41am EDT
You havent been trained at that store yet and different stores have different policies

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 12:42am EDT

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 12:42am EDT

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 12:42am EDT
they are literally the dumbest questions ever

I honestly dont know what they are for

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 12:44am EDT
maybe to just weed out anyone too impatient to actually finish one?

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 12:44am EDT

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 12:44am EDT

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 12:46am EDT
and when i need to pick adjectives

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 12:47am EDT

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 12:47am EDT

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 12:47am EDT

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 12:48am EDT

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 12:48am EDT
but who says i can't be motivated AND interesting? it's not my fault if i'm interesting pfft.

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 12:49am EDT
*Which adjective best describes you at work? Punctual Graceful *Which adjective best describes you at work? Unique Orderly *Which adjective best describes you at work? Artistic Responsible like these are just so ridiculous *Which adjective best describes you at work? Complicated Competitive

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 12:50am EDT
Do you reside in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, or are you applying for a position in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, or are you applying for a position in the city of Newark, New Jersey? Yes if you say yes, you move on to the next step. if you say no, however

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 12:50am EDT

Do not answer "Yes" if your conviction record has been annulled, expunged, vacated, sealed, pardoned, erased, impounded or restricted. *Note - The existence of a criminal history will not automatically disqualify you from the job you are applying for.

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 12:55am EDT
i'd just be all nuetral

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 12:56am EDT
it's like will this make me sound like an asshole? better go with neutral

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 12:57am EDT
i would just try to find somebody to talk to

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 12:58am EDT
It feels like entering the lottery with those questionairres

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 12:58am EDT
it might as well be

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 12:58am EDT

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 12:58am EDT
i actually got called for an interview at homegoods and wasnt that shitty

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 12:59am EDT
ohhh look at you go

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 12:59am EDT
what does integrity mean to you she asked this one question in a roundabout way, explaining for like 3 minutes, which was essentially: if you had to do something and report your progress to a person, how would you go about that?

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 12:59am EDT
they actually called back?

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 12:59am EDT
um.. keep track of my progress and tell them????

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:00am EDT

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:00am EDT

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:00am EDT

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:00am EDT

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:00am EDT
beginners luck on the beginning part

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:00am EDT

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:00am EDT

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:00am EDT

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:01am EDT
WHEN I HAVE 0 WORK EXPERIENCE AND KEEP HAVING TO FILL IN WHEN I VOLUNTEERED AT THE LIBRARY WHEN IT'S /KIND OF/ RELEVANT

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:01am EDT
ugh

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:02am EDT
would that be considered a catch 22?

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:02am EDT
yes it is

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:02am EDT
in order to get a job you need a job

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:02am EDT
YES

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:02am EDT

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:03am EDT
in order to get experience, you need a job. in order to get a job, you need experience. in order to get to your job, you need transportation. in order to get transportation, you need a job.

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:03am EDT
I DIDN'T ASK TO BE PUT ON THIS GODFORSAKEN PLANET NICHOLAS WHY DO I NEED TO DO ALL OF THESE RIDICULOUS THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO LEAVE ME IN A WORLD OF PAIN AND BROKENESS CAUSE ARCHITECTURE STUDENT WHO CANT GET EVEN A SUMMER JOB

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:04am EDT
its obvioulsy your fault for not having a richer family or a random millionaire to get you a job

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:05am EDT
i read another thing on the internet today about architecture and how it's just a world of debt

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:05am EDT
i also found out there are plenty of firms in new jersey, some of which were on fancy lists all about an hour away at the least from here

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:05am EDT
thats pretty good, does your school offer any coop opportunities? or ways to get connections?

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:07am EDT
we don't offer a coop thing but you meet people just by going to classes like a lot of the teachers obviously are also practicing architects and people that work at firms and theres lectures for days with fancy people

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:07am EDT
good thing me and betty are bffs. reference for life.

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:07am EDT

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:07am EDT

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:08am EDT
yeah i'm pretty sure the only reason college matters anymore is to get your foot in the door to an actual job

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:08am EDT
which is another fun thing

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:08am EDT
architecture jobs

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:08am EDT

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:09am EDT

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:09am EDT

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:09am EDT

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:15am EDT
She's so stressed about getting ajob

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:15am EDT

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:16am EDT
i know he can't help it and he hates his job at the candy store, which i keep telling him to quit but he won't yet. but like. complain to someone who has a job and can sympathize with you

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:16am EDT
cause i'm just gonna be a bitch about it

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:16am EDT
unintentionally

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:16am EDT
i'm going to be bitter because you're sitting there doing that

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:16am EDT
THEN

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:16am EDT
offering to buy me things

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:16am EDT
which is very nice and gentlemanly

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:17am EDT
because he's been doing that since day one you know food cause nomz and need food to survive

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:17am EDT
but

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:17am EDT

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:17am EDT
and then he gets on my ass to call these places back and im like I JUST SUBMITTED THE APPLICATION /TODAY/

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
he's been doing it less lately i think he's starting to take a hint but ugh

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
i completely understand

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
i try not to talk at all about work with sara because I cant do shit

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
that would help

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
id just be pestering

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:19am EDT
i know there have to be little things i'm doing that bother her though

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:19am EDT
at least you're being conscientious about it though

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:19am EDT
i know she's stressed about finding a job and i know a lot of people are cause my moms like yeah jennifers daughter or whoever

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:19am EDT
people she works with, their children

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:21am EDT
my 14 year old brother has a job and i don't

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:22am EDT
right before his first day he was like guess what guess what i start work tomorow woo woo job job job and i know its him being excited and im like bye what can you do though!

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:22am EDT
apply to all the places

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:22am EDT
basically

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:23am EDT
i'd probably end up just literally asking for the manager

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:23am EDT
and sking them specifically

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:23am EDT
theyd either be like dafuq is this guy doing

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:23am EDT
and kick me out

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:23am EDT
or be like this guy has motivation

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:23am EDT
and i'd have an actual chance

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:25am EDT
because there is so much bullshit to go through with big stores

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:25am EDT
yeah that's true

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:25am EDT
i'd never tell the employee i want to see the manager about a job though

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:25am EDT
because they wold just blow me off

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:26am EDT
be like 'please apply online yadayadayada'

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:26am EDT
and if i was super rude oby being that way or something... well i'm never gonna se them again so fuck it

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:26am EDT
off course this is me speaking when i actually have a job or 3

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:27am EDT
so i dont count

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:27am EDT
OH

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:27am EDT
If you are super desperate for some money

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:27am EDT
like just something to do when you're bored to make some cash

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:28am EDT
?

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:28am EDT
"MTurk is an Amazon website which allows you to work from home and make some money. The pay isn't very high (way below minimum wage), but you get to work for yourself, on your own free time, for as much as you want, doing only what you want. For example, one of the better jobs (or HITs as they are called) is answering AskVille questions which were'nt answered by AskVillers in 4 hours (just like this one!). Each week the person who answers the most is paid $100 (plus 2 cents per question), and the 29 people after the leader make anywhere between $13 to $97. For most of us, the money really isn't the motivation. Some like to keep busy, some find the tasks to be fun, some like to help others out, etc. If you want to know more about MTurk, I suggest you pay a visit to the website: http://www.mturk.com And also drop by the forums where we discuss everything mturk-related: http://turkers.proboards80.com/ Or, if you have any specific questions, I'll be glad to help."

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:29am EDT
I do this sometimes, I've made like $20 over the past 3 months

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:29am EDT
but I've only worked like 3 hours

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:30am EDT
because I got bored

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:30am EDT
considering my tuesdays and thursdays i do literally nothing this will probably be a thing i do to keep me busy lol thanks

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:30am EDT
you just sign up

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:30am EDT
hook up your bank account

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:30am EDT

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:31am EDT

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:31am EDT
and internet searches

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:31am EDT
filling out papers

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:31am EDT
maybe reviewing websites or writing an article

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:31am EDT
simple stuff

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:34am EDT
and its all like legit

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:34am EDT
yes

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:34am EDT
completely

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:35am EDT
i mean you'd be making less than minimum wage most likely if yu tried it as a full time thing

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:35am EDT
but you could easily make a hundred or two per month

Steph Dudak May 31, 2013 at 1:36am EDT
definitely like i said it's something to keep me busy if i feel like it so

Nick Devlin May 31, 2013 at 1:36am EDT
yeah but its totally legit

Steph Dudak June 8, 2013 at 10:00am EDT
that is indeed a thing haha

Nick Devlin June 8, 2013 at 10:02am EDT
This is soooo weird i am on facebook... sorta but i have no wifi is this what other phones are like?

Nick Devlin June 8, 2013 at 10:02am EDT

Nick Devlin June 8, 2013 at 10:09am EDT
Your face just popped up on my screen... that weird kissy face. It frightened me

Steph Dudak June 8, 2013 at 12:09pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 8, 2013 at 12:13pm EDT
Funfun

Nick Devlin June 8, 2013 at 12:14pm EDT

Nick Devlin June 8, 2013 at 12:21pm EDT
I know! So exciting but my mom left me here so im just waiting

Nick Devlin June 8, 2013 at 1:58pm EDT
So its at 3

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 12:58am EDT
so js i wish i started that mturk thing a little bit earlier since it holds whatever you make for a 10 day period

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 12:59am EDT
but that's okay

Nick Devlin June 9, 2013 at 1:07am EDT
Really? Didnt know that

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:09am EDT
yes it changes the status of things to like "accepted - payment pending" or whatever

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:09am EDT
but it holds it for 10 active days. you need to submit 3 hits a day for 10 unique days

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:10am EDT
luckily i just submitted one, and it counted for the 8th >:D cause i only submitted two lol

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:10am EDT
but i have $4.33 pending, woo! haha. some of these surveys are kind of interesting some are super irritating

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:10am EDT
but i did them anyway cause i already started it

Nick Devlin June 9, 2013 at 1:11am EDT
Pretty much how it works

Nick Devlin June 9, 2013 at 1:11am EDT
Some are just really weird

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:14am EDT
i took this one today oh jesus okay so

Nick Devlin June 9, 2013 at 1:16am EDT
Were you cut off or still writing?

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:16am EDT
it was this "family feud" thing right. so it starts off with like dumb questions. then it's like OKAY! family feud practice rounds! one you have barely any time, the other you'll have more time. answer whatchu can! (it was like a. i don't remember how much it paid but you get entered for a chance to win a $25 amazon giftcard so i was like meh why not whatev family feud). so you do those. and it's like whatever. THEN AFTER. it gives me a super nonsensical paragraph, in which i need to click all the "e"s. after 3 mins the next button would appear. it was more than one paragraph actually. i only did the first like paragraph after WANTING TO KILL MYSELF

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:16am EDT
AND THEN AFTER THAT

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:16am EDT
IT GAVE ME ANOTHER, BUT THIS ONE HAD RULES

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:17am EDT
1) don't press the "e"s with vowels right after them (ie bear) 2) don't press the "e"s with vowels two letters before it (ie vowel)

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:17am EDT
BUT THIS TIME

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:17am EDT
it was SEVEN MINUTES TIL THE NEXT BUTTON APPEARED

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:17am EDT
AND I WANTED TO DIE and it was like lolol testing u NOW HERE'S A FIVE MINUTE BREAK PERIOD

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:17am EDT
WHICH I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO SKIP

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I HAD TO DO FOR THAT "BREAK"?

Nick Devlin June 9, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
Ahahaha Sounds awesome. Was it one of those psych test tjings

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
they put up NATURE PICTURES

Nick Devlin June 9, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
Ahahaha Sounds awesome. Was it one of those psych test tjings

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
for like 10 seconds each

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
THEN IT ASKED ME IF I LIKED THEM AND I SAID NO OUT OF SPITE

Nick Devlin June 9, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
To sooth your minf

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
and then it was like yeah did that break help you? and i'm like no

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
i don't want a break

Nick Devlin June 9, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
Destress

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
it was boring

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
i just want to go through the rest of this thing

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:19am EDT
and it asked more questions like that and it was like

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:19am EDT
this is the best part

Nick Devlin June 9, 2013 at 1:19am EDT
Cant wait

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:19am EDT
so we basically wanted to test you and your patience and basically see if you'd actually finish this because you are not going to actually be playing family feud, even though right before the break we told you that you were going to be playing a time rich version of it CONGRATULATIONS

Nick Devlin June 9, 2013 at 1:20am EDT
Ahahahaha totally a psych test

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:20am EDT
but yeah it was a cognitive test

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:20am EDT
and it was just like ._.

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:20am EDT
what breaks when you drop it on the ground? Glass Lightbulb really lightbulb hm wow great

Nick Devlin June 9, 2013 at 1:20am EDT
Sounds awesome how much was it? Like moniez

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:21am EDT
lol like 50 cents + the maybe chance at a $25 giftcard

Nick Devlin June 9, 2013 at 1:21am EDT
Fifty cents is pretty decent

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:22am EDT
i've done a couple pretty decent ones like

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:22am EDT
i did maybe 4 or so, give or take idk that were like $1, one was 1.92 and like 50, 80 cents. and some 30

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:22am EDT
it adds up once it's approved and i'm not doing things anyway so i figured why not

Nick Devlin June 9, 2013 at 1:23am EDT

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:24am EDT

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:24am EDT

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:24am EDT
well

Nick Devlin June 9, 2013 at 1:24am EDT
Its fumny you say that because i found this site from a subreddit called beermoney

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:25am EDT
i need to get a 20x20 frame, cause i'm gonna give him my concept drawing. with the triangles and such

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:25am EDT
beermoney? lol

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:25am EDT
and i wanted to get him a pair of philau sweatpants bc 1) he wants a pair and has no sweatpants and theyre comfy

Nick Devlin June 9, 2013 at 1:25am EDT
Yeah kust easy ways to make a little money when bored

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:25am EDT

Nick Devlin June 9, 2013 at 1:26am EDT
pants sound fun i like the triangle thing though

Nick Devlin June 9, 2013 at 1:26am EDT
Yes you d

Nick Devlin June 9, 2013 at 1:26am EDT
Did

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:26am EDT
he called dibs on it after i drew it and i told him he could have it but idk if he remembers that lol

Nick Devlin June 9, 2013 at 1:26am EDT
Possible

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:26am EDT
yes i want to get these ones i think http://www.amazon.com/Necklaces-Double-Lucky-Black-Crystals/dp/B002V4XQRM/ref=pd_sbs_jw_2/176-1265683-8593048 instead of the ones that have the silver ying yang things on the top

Nick Devlin June 9, 2013 at 1:27am EDT
Those are amazing

Nick Devlin June 9, 2013 at 1:27am EDT
If you dont get them i totally am

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:27am EDT

so many cool things

Nick Devlin June 9, 2013 at 1:28am EDT
I will be browsing through

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:29am EDT
i was kind of iffy on getting necklaces because i know he always has that coin one on. like he never takes it off. so i dunno that he'd wear it often. but it's still nice and i'm sure he would wear it at some point since it's still ~manly~ and it's for both of us and i know he'd appreciate it so there's still winning lol

Nick Devlin June 9, 2013 at 1:30am EDT
It sounds like a good idea to me

Nick Devlin June 9, 2013 at 1:30am EDT
And i know rich is so concerned about his manly aura

Nick Devlin June 9, 2013 at 1:31am EDT
So good you took it into account

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:31am EDT
well you know what i mean :P. It's not a girly necklace

Nick Devlin June 9, 2013 at 1:31am EDT

Steph Dudak June 9, 2013 at 1:33am EDT

Nick Devlin July 7, 2013 at 8:39pm EDT
I thought it might

Nick Devlin July 7, 2013 at 8:41pm EDT
How was your day?

Steph Dudak July 7, 2013 at 8:43pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 7, 2013 at 8:46pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 7, 2013 at 8:46pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 7, 2013 at 8:47pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 7, 2013 at 8:49pm EDT
Don't tell Sara.i want to wait until i break it to her gently

Steph Dudak July 7, 2013 at 8:50pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 7, 2013 at 8:51pm EDT

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 6:20pm EDT
i need to rant to you when youre online

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 8:04pm EDT
I am here to be ranted to

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 8:29pm EDT
ARE YOU STILL HERE?

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 8:30pm EDT
COME BACK

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 10:12pm EDT
I'm sorry!

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 10:13pm EDT
I tried!

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:13pm EDT
okay

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:13pm EDT
youre here now

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 10:13pm EDT
I am

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:13pm EDT
so you know how i'm rooming with alayna and her friend olivia next semester

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 10:14pm EDT
I do know that

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:14pm EDT
well some random got thrown into our place because we only had 3/4 people since this girl sophia that was originally there transferred

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:14pm EDT
some girl named kaleelah amahd or something

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:14pm EDT
who is 24 irrelevant

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 10:14pm EDT
Okay

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:15pm EDT
the things that are important though: she's a rather light sleeper, she goes to bed at 12 the latest, and wakes up at like 7 am, according to her profile thing

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:16pm EDT
so. originally, alayna and olivia were going to share a room, and i was in a single and so was the 4th person. the 4th person leaves, and olivia and alayna don't want to be in a room with empty furniture. so, being 3 people, i'm like alright fine i'll take the double room. Now we have the 4th person. so alayna asks me if i'd be okay with being in the double room with this other girl.

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 10:17pm EDT
Hmm

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:17pm EDT
so

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:18pm EDT
not wanting to be like "nah i don't want to" i respond with i mean i dunno how okay she'd be with when i have rich over / if my side of the room gets kind of messy because i'm mostly in studio so sometimes my supplies pile up a bit. if you and olivia really don't want to room together / room with her though i don't care oh that was another thing. the way she keeps her room and stuff. always neat. cleans super often

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:18pm EDT
i don't have time to clean that much, because studio. also as a result, my area of whatever room tends to get a little messy. just with supplies and stuff.

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:19pm EDT
so what does alayna respond to me with, you ask? i'll tell you

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:19pm EDT
well me and liv really planned on having our rooms. if thats okay with you. Im sure she will be fine with Rich coming and if she isn't then she can go in the living room. I think its going to be better this year because like we aren't just limited to one room. you know

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 10:19pm EDT
Mhmm

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 10:21pm EDT
You are rooming with the new girl t that is nice and super clean and sleeps at appropriate hours

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:21pm EDT
so alright lets see. when i roomed with abbie, she was always in the room whenever rich visited. rarely had time to ourselves. i didn't mention this. even though alayna knew this already. also "liv and i really planned on having our own rooms" really? so did i. weird. and it's not so much being limited to one room it's perhaps i want to be doing homework in my room at 3 in the morning rather than in the kitchen. okay. didn't say that either cause stil trying to not be an asshole

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 10:22pm EDT
And are afraid of being annoying to her?

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:23pm EDT
i will send you the rest

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 10:23pm EDT
Funfun

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:23pm EDT
yeah i also was really planning on that lol but it's also the fact that she gets up early and goes to bed early and is a rather light sleeper. none of my classes start til like 9:30 or later i'm pretty sure and being that i'll rarely be going to bed before 2am, i kind of try to hold on to all the sleep i can get. i just feel like it's more trouble. but it doesn't really matter. if you two really want your own rooms it's fine. it was your space in the first place so i can room with her i don't want to compromise anything i mean lol like compromise the living conditions not like "i dont want to make a compromise" BECAUSE STILL NOT BEING A DOUCHEBAG

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 10:23pm EDT
I'm gonna need to like draw diagrams to keep up

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:24pm EDT
tell me when you're ready

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:28pm EDT
okay ill assume you are youre a fast reader

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 10:28pm EDT
I am

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:28pm EDT
so then she says hahah i got it lol and thanks so much! I think it will all work out and like I said we aren't just limited to our rooms so we can do homework in the living room and kitchen! and who knows this girl may never be in the room! lol and I don't want this to cause an issue either so it will all work out i think! I just emailed that lady asking if she can give me that girls email

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:29pm EDT
alright so basically i should've just said "no i'm not" in the beginning cause fuck me right

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:30pm EDT
okay i'm sure she will be whenever i'm there if she goes to bed and wakes up when she says she does lol. i'm just saying now though that if i get woken up at 7 in the morning often, i'm going to be cranky as hell a lot so don't be surprised. i'm not trying to sound like an asshole lol at least with abbie we ran on the same schedule since we were in the same major and had mostly the same classes. But if you get her email let me know. that way i can talk to her because still being not an asshole so

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:32pm EDT
i get to be the one thrown with a random person because she and olivia "really planned on having their own rooms" while, on the rez life portal, it's set up so her and olivia are in the double, because they also run on similar fucking schedules and decided it, and me and whoever else are by ourselves. i understand that we can go in other rooms and stuff

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:32pm EDT
but isn't it a little ridiculous that when ALL OF YOU PEOPLE GO TO BED AT DECENT HOURS AND WAKE UP AT FAIRLY DECENT HOURS

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:34pm EDT
AND ALL CLEAN REGULARLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE TIME AND NONE OF YOU HAVE BOYFRIENDS THAT ARE VISITING EVERY SO OFTEN AND YOURE JAHGKLDHG am i wrong to be a little bit mad? i know i didn't say "no i don't want to do that" but would anyone really have said just flat out no when they havent met the person or whatever or thought everyone else would be pissed off abou tit

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 10:35pm EDT
You should be pissed

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 10:36pm EDT
None of this should have even happened or makes any sense

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:36pm EDT
i just think it's rude especially since their only reason is "wow we really planned on having our own room" But... you and olivia.. were planning on rooming together in the first place??? you are like best friends??? and work on similar schedules im sure???/

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:37pm EDT
and have similar interests

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:37pm EDT
listen to similar music

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:37pm EDT
and all she says is I think it will be fine! lol don't stress! and yea i will deff send you her email!

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:38pm EDT
so i better get this girls email so i can talk to her because her input matters too

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:38pm EDT
i dunno it's just kind of stupid

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 10:38pm EDT
Yeah that sounds awful

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 10:39pm EDT
Why aren't you rooming with Amy

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:39pm EDT
amy lives off campus

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:39pm EDT
she commutes

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:39pm EDT
otherwise we would be living together

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 10:39pm EDT
Just wondering. that's annoying

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 10:40pm EDT
Like yeah I'm really sorry. I hope that getsstraighten

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:40pm EDT
it's okay. i just don't know what to do now cause i know i'm going to be stuck with that girl.

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:44pm EDT
either way i'm inconvenienced because i only said yes to living with them in the first place because they needed a fourth person in order to get into IP. basically from there i should've just said nope and lived in schollar. but whatever

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 10:47pm EDT
Maybe the girl will be super nice

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 10:48pm EDT
I think that would make things easier

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 10:48pm EDT
She sound like she is. But living with people is different than most situations

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 10:49pm EDT
Yeah i think i would keep trying to get Olivia and Alayna back together in a room

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:50pm EDT
like i said i'm going to try to get in touch with the girl and talk to her because her input matters as well. and she could very well rather not room with me and want to be alone, and alayna and olivia can't just be like "no."

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 10:50pm EDT
That sounds like the easiest course if action

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:55pm EDT
i messaged her on the portal thing and asked her to email me so now we wait to see if she sees it

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 10:56pm EDT
Yeah hopefully she does soon before Alayna and Oliva get super attached to their rooms

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:57pm EDT
i just can't believe that's the only reason she gave me.

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:57pm EDT
i think that's what pissed me off the most

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 10:57pm EDT
Yeah i would not be happy

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:57pm EDT
like if i had no reason to not room with the other girl, then i would just be like yeah sure

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:58pm EDT
but the fact that it has a possibility of conflicting with my life in general more than anyone elses

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:58pm EDT
YES

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 10:58pm EDT
SHE ANSWERED BACK

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 10:58pm EDT
Yay!

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 11:07pm EDT
okay

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 11:07pm EDT
so

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 11:07pm EDT
i have this right onw

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 11:07pm EDT
now (

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 11:07pm EDT
*** *gjdgh

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 11:07pm EDT
Hey! Just our rooms for next semester. The situation on the reslife portal is that you and I are in separate rooms and Alayna and Olivia are in a double together. (I know Alayna from high school, but she and Olivia are quite good friends.) Well, being that Sophia transferred and left it just the three of us, they were planning to move into the two single rooms and me in the double by myself. Now that you'll be living us, Alayna's asked if it's okay that you and I stay in the double room together. I wanted to ask you your input on this just because I'm not sure what your major is and I don't want things to conflict. (It seems the arrangements on the reslife portal would be favorable, but that's just my opinion lol). So I just wanted to tell you a little bit about myself! I'm an architecture major and to be honest, I rarely get back in/go to bed before 2am because of studio and such. (As a result it's also rare that I wake up very early :P). Yeah, I'm not exactly the best at time management. Being that I'm in studio so much, I'm often in and out of the room and whatever is on my side of the room tends to get kind of disorganized for a while (I don't leave garbage around or anything, just project supplies and such! This wasn't a problem with my last roommate because we were both architecture majors and we ran on pretty much the exact same schedule. So I never had to worry about being woken up or waking her up by coming in too late nor did we have to worry about project messes because it was a mutual understanding, though we tried to keep it as contained as possible.) I also have a boyfriend of a year now who will be visiting every 2 weeks (on weekends) or so and spending nights with me. He lives here at home in NJ so while I'm at school that's the only time we get to see each other and spend time together. I'm not sure what your take on this is, but I wanted to have your input as well before it was decided who was being placed where.

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 11:07pm EDT
...

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 11:08pm EDT
(oh right she asked what id like to discuss)

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 11:09pm EDT
i also don't want to come off as rude

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 11:09pm EDT
but want to kind of hint that we should not be in the same room yet happy that she'll be joining us

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 11:10pm EDT
That seemed pretty good to me

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 11:12pm EDT
should i just send that?

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 11:12pm EDT
Yes i think so

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 11:13pm EDT
cool

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 11:13pm EDT
sent

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 11:13pm EDT
hopefully she DOESNT WANT TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM AS ME

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 11:14pm EDT
Hopefully.

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 11:14pm EDT
Maybe as you talk try to stress how really okay you are with going to original arrangement

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 11:15pm EDT
yeah i did throw that in that the reslife arrangements (the original) are favorable in my opinion lol

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 11:15pm EDT
we shall see

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 11:15pm EDT
fingers crossed

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 11:15pm EDT
You got this

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 11:15pm EDT
ive lost every game of candy crush i played today as well as mario party so please let this go in my favor

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 11:16pm EDT
I think you deserve this

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 11:16pm EDT
thank you nicholas

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 11:25pm EDT
HEH

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 11:25pm EDT
>:D

Steph Dudak July 8, 2013 at 11:25pm EDT
I appreciate your letting me know. I plan on living in the single room I was assigned to by ResLife. It's really non-negotiable. I'm sorry for the other two girls, but the single room housing situation was/is a stipulation of my living on campus. I hope the girls aren't too disappointed. Pls let them have my email if they want to contact me. On another note, you sound pretty cool to me. I'm a Law & Society major & I am a senior. I had been living off campus before & this will be my first year on campus. I'm looking forward to it. Also look forward to getting to know you. I'm confident we'll get alone. I'm fairly chill. As long as stuff gets done, ppl are responsible & respectful, I'm totally chill about everything else. Oh and I'm for Northern CA, the Bay Area. Best, K

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 11:27pm EDT
Ahahaga awesome

Nick Devlin July 8, 2013 at 11:28pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 10, 2013 at 9:42pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 10, 2013 at 9:42pm EDT
I talked to her yesterday

Nick Devlin July 10, 2013 at 9:43pm EDT
She said she saw the group message but didn't get a chance to answer she agrees that we need to hang out though

Steph Dudak July 10, 2013 at 9:46pm EDT
well that's good at least

Nick Devlin July 10, 2013 at 9:46pm EDT
I am appreciative of your concurrence on the topic of nonsensical breathing hindrances

Steph Dudak July 10, 2013 at 9:46pm EDT
it's really weird when i have dreams in which i'm smoking that happens sometimes and it doesn't make sense

Nick Devlin July 10, 2013 at 9:47pm EDT
For some reason i can see you smoking

Nick Devlin July 10, 2013 at 9:47pm EDT
Like rich could never look normal smoking

Steph Dudak July 10, 2013 at 9:48pm EDT
He would look really funny lol

Nick Devlin July 10, 2013 at 9:48pm EDT
But you are like artsy and you remind me of like classic rock

Nick Devlin July 10, 2013 at 9:48pm EDT
So both those groups are known to smoke so it works

Nick Devlin July 10, 2013 at 9:51pm EDT
I am glad you don't though

Steph Dudak July 10, 2013 at 9:53pm EDT
yeah i'd probably die sooner than i already will

Steph Dudak July 10, 2013 at 9:53pm EDT
i dont need that

Nick Devlin July 10, 2013 at 9:54pm EDT
True

Nick Devlin July 10, 2013 at 9:55pm EDT
Dying us something I'd like to avoid

Steph Dudak July 11, 2013 at 2:01pm EDT
I got Rich to start playing wow with me because right now he doesnt have to pay for it >:D

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 2:47pm EDT
That poor boy

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 2:47pm EDT
You're evil

Steph Dudak July 11, 2013 at 2:47pm EDT
He wants to play again though he he he >:D

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 2:47pm EDT
That's the evil part!

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 2:48pm EDT
He's gonna get addicted and then what?

Steph Dudak July 11, 2013 at 2:48pm EDT
he plays enough mmos to know what he's getting himself into

Steph Dudak July 11, 2013 at 2:48pm EDT
don't worry

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 2:55pm EDT
I know he does

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 2:55pm EDT
But if you're there facilitating him

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 2:55pm EDT
Who knows what could happen

Steph Dudak July 11, 2013 at 3:55pm EDT
only good things

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 4:04pm EDT
That sounds about right

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 4:05pm EDT
You two can cosplay wow classes

Steph Dudak July 11, 2013 at 4:06pm EDT
I wish i were that talented People that cosplay are so awesome at making things

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 4:07pm EDT
It's kind of scary how good it is sometimes

Steph Dudak July 11, 2013 at 4:09pm EDT
it really is! That'd probably be a fun thing to pick up though, being able to do stuff like that. Talk about awesome halloween costumes too

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 4:11pm EDT
I do know how to sew now

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 4:12pm EDT
Totally should try something if i have time to breath

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 4:19pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 4:19pm EDT
Some kind of bibliomancer

Steph Dudak July 11, 2013 at 4:19pm EDT
You could totally do it

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 4:25pm EDT
Just scared the Shit out of a woodchuck

Steph Dudak July 11, 2013 at 4:38pm EDT
why would you do that

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 4:39pm EDT
Saw one lumbering down a hill

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 4:39pm EDT
Two actually

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 4:39pm EDT
Noticed that where they were going had no escape

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 4:40pm EDT
I didn't see many places for them to hide either so it seemed like a good opportunity to get a good look at them

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 4:40pm EDT
Turns out there was a tiny burrow

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 4:40pm EDT
And only one could fit inside

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 4:41pm EDT
So they fought over it and one tried to run but i was standing there so it went to the wall

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 4:44pm EDT
And just froze

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 4:44pm EDT
And it just froze. Hoping i would not see it i suppose

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 4:44pm EDT
Spam

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 4:44pm EDT
Ugh messages not sending

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 4:45pm EDT
There we go

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 4:46pm EDT
Anyway. I eventually decided that i gave it enough trauma and let him go

Steph Dudak July 11, 2013 at 4:47pm EDT
as long as youre not traumatizing woodchucks as a new hobby or anything

Nick Devlin July 11, 2013 at 4:49pm EDT
Nah i just thought they looked cute so pudgy

Nick Devlin July 21, 2013 at 7:23pm EDT
I just realized i coud write code that automatically reorganizes our movie group list

Nick Devlin July 21, 2013 at 7:23pm EDT
that wouldve been awesome, I think i'll write it

Steph Dudak July 21, 2013 at 7:27pm EDT
you go nick devlin

Steph Dudak July 28, 2013 at 12:49pm EDT
Just out of curiosity, was it you that added Becca to the movie group?

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 12:50pm EDT
Yeah i added her after Kerry invited her to that last day

Steph Dudak July 28, 2013 at 12:50pm EDT
Okie doke

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 12:51pm EDT
Porque? Should i not have?

Steph Dudak July 28, 2013 at 12:52pm EDT
I was just wondering, I didn't know who had. I don't suppose there's any issue with it, Becca's nice and everything. I just don't know her so well myself haha

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 12:53pm EDT
I was talking to her at school one day and she said me and her needed to hang out some time with like kerry and other people

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 12:54pm EDT
i asked who else she would invite and everyone she said was from the movie group

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 12:54pm EDT
so i was like well why not see if she would go to movie day and asked kerry

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 12:55pm EDT
i feel like we should invite like 1 person per year

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 12:55pm EDT
like some secret society

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 12:55pm EDT
like the stone masons

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 12:55pm EDT
but with movies

Steph Dudak July 28, 2013 at 12:55pm EDT
I wouldn't go that far lol we don't ever have that much space BUt I don't oppose the addition of Becca

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 12:55pm EDT
funfun

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 12:55pm EDT
true our houses arent that big

Steph Dudak July 28, 2013 at 12:56pm EDT
We can hardly fit us most of the tim ehahaha

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 12:56pm EDT
maybe when we are all rich artists and engineers

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 12:56pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 12:56pm EDT
and architect and business person

Steph Dudak July 28, 2013 at 12:56pm EDT
We'll still be at Laurie's house, cause she'll be the one with a fancy home theatre lol

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 12:56pm EDT
or maybe aja

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 12:56pm EDT
if she inherits her dad's stuff

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 12:57pm EDT
she has like a sanctum

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 12:57pm EDT
Laurie's theatre will be pretty cool i'm sure

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 12:57pm EDT
But my library will be the best!

Steph Dudak July 28, 2013 at 12:57pm EDT
I'll just have lots of cool staircases and hidden passageways

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 12:58pm EDT
ughhh you gotta install some of those into my lirary

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 12:58pm EDT
those are the coolest

Steph Dudak July 28, 2013 at 12:58pm EDT
I'd be disappointed if you didn't have an extravagant library in your home WILL DO

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 12:58pm EDT
good!

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 12:59pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 1:00pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 1:01pm EDT

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 1:01pm EDT
with a very well tended outside property

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 1:03pm EDT
and i would have a garbage outside, but once you got inside it had ton sof cool stuff everywhere

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 1:03pm EDT
like a mixture of east meets west, a library, and a tech store

Steph Dudak July 28, 2013 at 1:06pm EDT
I expect us all to eventually have pretty cool houses

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 1:06pm EDT
or we all just end up homeless

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 1:07pm EDT
go big or go hom--

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 1:07pm EDT

Steph Dudak July 28, 2013 at 1:07pm EDT
i don't quite know how obtaining houses work

Steph Dudak July 28, 2013 at 1:07pm EDT
hopefully that's a thing i find out

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 1:08pm EDT
i feel like thats a thing you should study as an architect

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 1:08pm EDT
well i suppose it depends on what kind of architect

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 1:08pm EDT
but still

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 1:09pm EDT
you basically just call a real estate agent, tell them what you want. They show you a bunch of houses, you pick one you like. You get a loan from a bank, then you pay it off for a few decades

Steph Dudak July 28, 2013 at 1:10pm EDT
loans for life

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 1:10pm EDT
thats how our economy works

Nick Devlin July 28, 2013 at 1:10pm EDT
