Nick DevlinThursday, December 1, 2011 at 12:00am EST

Nick DevlinThursday, December 1, 2011 at 12:00am EST
but if I want to write

Nick DevlinThursday, December 1, 2011 at 12:00am EST
I need to have control of my brain

Nick DevlinThursday, December 1, 2011 at 12:00am EST
which isn't really likely this late

Steph DudakThursday, December 1, 2011 at 12:01am EST
Well I'd hope you would be the one controlling it

Nick DevlinThursday, December 1, 2011 at 12:01am EST
well I have an influence

Nick DevlinThursday, December 1, 2011 at 12:01am EST
but it seems to have a mind of its own

Steph DudakThursday, December 1, 2011 at 12:01am EST
Ooooooooorly

Nick DevlinThursday, December 1, 2011 at 12:02am EST
you didn't space

Nick DevlinThursday, December 1, 2011 at 12:02am EST
it discombobulated me

Nick DevlinThursday, December 1, 2011 at 12:02am EST
orly

Nick DevlinThursday, December 1, 2011 at 12:02am EST
oorly

Nick DevlinThursday, December 1, 2011 at 12:06am EST
yeah this is why I'm not writing right now, I'm going to sleep now

Nick DevlinThursday, December 1, 2011 at 12:07am EST
because I keep writing stupid things

Nick DevlinThursday, December 1, 2011 at 12:07am EST
which I suppose isn't much different from normally

Nick DevlinThursday, December 1, 2011 at 12:07am EST

i ne yo helpz

Nick DevlinThursday, December 1, 2011 at 5:20pm EST
i am trying to be polite and not shout as you can see by my lack of caps

Nick DevlinThursday, December 1, 2011 at 5:20pm EST
During my first years of High School I took a class called Intro to Computer Graphics and Design. I had always liked to draw on the computer so it seemed like a fun course to take. When the course started however, we weren’t even allowed access on the computers. We were given paper and pencils, then shown how to draw circles and lines; of course rulers and compasses were more forbidden that were not to be mentioned. Only after we had proven we were able to draw straight lines and round circle were we given permission to start our first project. On paper. I was beginning to think that although the drawing techniques we were learning were interesting, this class was kind of missing the point of the Computer graphics aspect. Surprisingly it turns out that I had no clue what I was doing and the teacher did. Without all the preparation from drawing and learning the feel of our designs it would have made drawing on the computer useless. I learned a sense of proportion and how things all fit on a paper, along with the layout of the paper and other things that I would never have learned solely on the computer. I loved all the different things that went into making projects look right, the colors and shapes that defined it. I’ve been trying to take as many art and computer classes that can fit into my schedule since then. Somehow I have only this year been able to find a way to fit the Advanced Computer Graphics and Design Course into my schedule, and I’m ecstatic that I have been able to. So far this year my projects have been frustrating and seem like they will go well, but in the end I’m always proud of how they turn out. I love computers and design is one of the most enjoyable things I like to do so I sincerely hope that I am able to make it a bigger part of my life.

Nick DevlinThursday, December 1, 2011 at 5:20pm EST
My drexel essay

Steph DudakThursday, December 1, 2011 at 5:24pm EST
One sec

Nick DevlinThursday, December 1, 2011 at 5:24pm EST
whenever you got time

Nick DevlinThursday, December 1, 2011 at 5:25pm EST
i'm starting another essay right now

Steph DudakThursday, December 1, 2011 at 5:32pm EST
Introduction And access TO the computers. "of course rulers and compasses were more forbidden that were not to be mentioned" I don't get what you're saying here Round circles* not circle take out point in "... This class was kind of missing the point of the computer graphics aspect" also do not capitalize computer Surprisingly, Add a comma Turned out not turns out. "I learned a sense of proportion and how things all fit on a paper" take out all or reword it bc it sounds awkward how you have it there in my opinion Reword that somehow sentence. Blahblahblah but I am ecstatic instead of and So far the projects have been frustrating and seem like they will go well? Will not go well? I mean if they're frustrating. One of the most enjoyable things I do. Not like to do. Or um no that still sounds a little weird. But like to do us redundant

Steph DudakThursday, December 1, 2011 at 5:32pm EST
Otherwise it's fine

Steph DudakThursday, December 1, 2011 at 5:32pm EST
Just grammatical things and whatnot

Steph DudakThursday, December 1, 2011 at 5:35pm EST

World affairs project = due in a week. Seven sections, 15 slides each, the entire thing needs to have music. Rofl I should just put on octavarium for the entire thing. 20 minute song, 6-12 min presentation bam. Anyway I didn't even start yet. Well I'll get like 15 slides done in a few mins bc I have a list of dead people. Physics test Thursday which makes me want to cry. Art projects on Wednesday. Barely have one started.... That's the main thing. I need to do pre calc and lit hw right now still cause I decided to not finish yesterday and help decorate my house. The only upside to this week is I get out of gym and lit on Wednesday bc I'm giving blood. Otherwise this week sucks. Omg that's awful ): I hate colds. They ruin everything basically. Cept I had one the last time I took my SATs and I got a much better score on that one so.

Nick DevlinSunday, December 4, 2011 at 10:08pm EST
That's wuite a bit, Kerry or I could get you into to TV21 afterschool to do your project probly

Nick DevlinSunday, December 4, 2011 at 10:09pm EST
and they won't fricking let me give blood because I don't have a lcense I'm pretty pissed about it

Nick DevlinSunday, December 4, 2011 at 10:09pm EST
I am gonna find who is in charge and ask them for another way

Nick DevlinSunday, December 4, 2011 at 10:09pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, December 4, 2011 at 10:11pm EST
Oh thanks but that won't be necessary. I think I'll be able to do it at home. I plan to get on it tomorrow as soon as I get home , lol, and then do art project stuff, and then start studying for physics

Steph DudakSunday, December 4, 2011 at 10:11pm EST

damn livin on the edge

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:08pm EST
friends that live too far away from me to have a normal friendship with

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:09pm EST
i should totally mock you and make yu define normal friendship

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:09pm EST
but i'm not

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:09pm EST
-.-

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:09pm EST
thank you

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:09pm EST
lol

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:10pm EST
for not being a douchebag for once

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:10pm EST
for once?!

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:10pm EST
you howw no idea how often i restrain myself from douchebaggery

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:10pm EST
i howw

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:10pm EST
totally was hoping that was a word

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:10pm EST
but its not

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:10pm EST
i HAVE

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:11pm EST
douchebaggery might as well be a word

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:11pm EST
it'll be added in like 2 years if its not already

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:12pm EST
for sure

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:12pm EST
so i have barely any of my history project done

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:12pm EST
i hate

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:12pm EST
having to do

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:12pm EST
like movie/powerpoint presentations

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:13pm EST
and i hate the time restriction

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:13pm EST
bc

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:13pm EST
we need 7 sections, 15 slides each, a song for each section, and the entire thing needs to be between 6 and 12 minutes

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:13pm EST
so then i gotta cut the songs and everything

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:13pm EST
and

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:13pm EST
whatnot

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:13pm EST
exciting

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:13pm EST
NO

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:13pm EST
unexciting

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:14pm EST
yes

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:14pm EST
cause im not having fun

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:14pm EST
and will be spending my entire weekend doing this

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:16pm EST
now imma try to burn these 16 slides to a blank dvd that way i can test it in class tomorrow to see if itll work when i have to actually go for my project

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:17pm EST
always a good idea

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:19pm EST
orrrr

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:19pm EST
test it on the first day

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:19pm EST
test*

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:19pm EST
no

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:19pm EST
if it doesnt work itll be a grade down

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:19pm EST
then you get an extra day to do it

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:20pm EST
that douche

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:20pm EST
we've had a month to do this project though. that's what this week is for really. and he's said 483746 times come in whenever and test to make sure it works just in case

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:20pm EST
grr

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:20pm EST
i could never take that class

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:22pm EST
mr knight

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:22pm EST
someone once gave him an empty flashdrive

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:22pm EST
as their video project

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:22pm EST
they got a B

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:23pm EST
nothing was ever mentioned about how it was empty

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:24pm EST
thats the history teacher who you should have

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:24pm EST
how did that even happen

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:24pm EST
x.x

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:26pm EST
my group didnt even show ours in class lol. jen recorded the moviemaker project cause she couldnt get it onto the flash drive or something dumb like that and we just showed him on her camera and he was like k cool A

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:29pm EST
at least they had something

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:34pm EST
I just hate video projects lol

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:35pm EST
they're usually not fun unless you're into it

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:35pm EST
since they take so much damn work

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:39pm EST
Exactly

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:39pm EST
I could be spending my time doing other things

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:40pm EST
Like all the other hw I have to do. And my art projects. I really wish I didn't need to take all these bs classes that idc about

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:40pm EST
yeah well it'll probly turn out better for you in the end

Steph DudakWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:40pm EST
It better

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 7, 2011 at 10:41pm EST
or else

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:11pm EST
this whole physics thing

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:11pm EST
if you do

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:12pm EST
1.3829 = 2pv.48/g what do you get.

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:12pm EST
is that a pi symbol?

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:12pm EST
yes

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:13pm EST
where's the variable?

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:13pm EST
the g?

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:13pm EST
yeah solve for g

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:14pm EST
the square root goes completely over the .48/g right?

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:14pm EST
yes

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:17pm EST
umm

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:17pm EST
the g stands for gravity, so the number should be close to 9.8

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:17pm EST
and i'm not getting anything near that at all

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:17pm EST
do you really want to wait for me to do this?

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:17pm EST
but that was the equation peck gave us sooo

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:17pm EST
if you're willing to do it

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:17pm EST
this lab isn't due or anything soon

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:18pm EST
i don't hand these in til the end of the marking period and brenna just asked me a question about it which compelled me to attempt to solve it but i failed

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:18pm EST
yeah, I am trying but I don't remember all the ways to solve equations

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:18pm EST
first you divide the 2 pi right?

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:18pm EST
then sqare both sides

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:19pm EST
that's what i tried doing

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:19pm EST
okay ready

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:19pm EST
hold on

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:21pm EST
1.3829 = 2pv.48/g 0.220095371 = v.48/g .048441972 = .48/g and if you multiply or divide by .48 you get a tiny tiny number

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:21pm EST
pretty much

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:22pm EST
wait

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:22pm EST
no

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:22pm EST
so obviously im doin somethin wrong

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:23pm EST
maybe somethin with the squaring?

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:23pm EST
I have no clue

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:24pm EST
I am getting the same answers as you

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:25pm EST
exactly! but you need to square both sides to undo a radical, but if you square a small number like that then you get an even smaller number

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:25pm EST
even doing .48/.048

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
gets like 12.blablabla

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
even if you were completely ignoring the rules of math

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
yeah i tried doing that!

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
then i tried testing the equation with other numbers

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
like

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:27pm EST
4 = 2v16/x

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:27pm EST
x has to equal 4 there

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:28pm EST
but that doesn't help me at all

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:32pm EST
not really

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:33pm EST
i mean that makes x like 4

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:33pm EST
which is kind of irrelevant

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:37pm EST
I'm not really much help here sorry

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:37pm EST
try kevin

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:38pm EST
i'll pass. but it's okay thank you lol

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:38pm EST
ah well

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:50pm EST
oh puns

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:50pm EST
I need to use them more

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:50pm EST
embrace the puns

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:50pm EST
i'm going to start tagging the puns i reblog on tumblr

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:50pm EST
bc apparently i don't have a pun tag

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:50pm EST
which is absurd

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:53pm EST
i can't believe i forgot to make that one of the tags that show up on my page

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:58pm EST
i can't believe it either

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:58pm EST
-shakes head-

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 5:59pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:07pm EST
totally found a better thing

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:07pm EST
than telling puns all the time

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:08pm EST
NOT telling puns all the time

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:08pm EST
then saying No pun intended after random sentences

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:14pm EST
sdjkhgrh

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:15pm EST
a man submitted ten puns to a contest hoping one of them would win. no pun in ten did.

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:15pm EST
I don

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:16pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:16pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:16pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:16pm EST
i'd go with option one

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:16pm EST
that kind of fails if you're just telling it in person though, apparently

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:18pm EST

what caused you to point out his stupidity?

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:20pm EST
and i guess I'll find out now

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:21pm EST
rofl this is exactly how he sent it actually. talk about awful grammar. but you get the idea. "Kira!! Ok, so if there only 2 people alive on the world. You and a random hobo, would save help repopulate the world or no?"

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:21pm EST
so i said

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:21pm EST
i'll read the rest once i stop laughing

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:24pm EST
but in doig that, like. wouldnt the children have to repopulate with each other as well? so wouldnt that cause some genetic issues. well either way i probably wouldn't. well good bye human race genetic mutations jan, might as well just die off with everyone else >_> just sayinnnn so you'll just let the human race die. mutation can be good in some ways. we huans have mutated and evolved over centuries. or it can get worse and worse and worse so you won't take the risk? wuss personally i don't care to take care of a bunch of kids, have my daughter marry my son, have kids, then have my granddaughter have kids with my other son laaaazy ...Lol it's not lazy. you do realize it's just one giant family that's marrying into each other over and over and over again. i'm not what good that'll do. surely you can't expect the majority of them to be without significant defects

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:26pm EST
Steph how could you be so self centered

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:26pm EST
what if the hobo was really hot?

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:26pm EST
THAT'S WHAT KERRY SAID

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:26pm EST
"WHAT IF THE HOBO WAS REALLY HOT?"

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:26pm EST
then i mentioned birth defects and whatnot and she's like o true

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:27pm EST
pshh it takes at least 4-5 generations before anything really bad happens

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:27pm EST
even still

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:27pm EST
if the hobo is really attractive

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:28pm EST
we'll have one kid

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:28pm EST
no we won't

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:28pm EST
because

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:28pm EST
there are no doctors around or anything. one of us would end up giving birth to my child

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:28pm EST
and what if something goes wrong

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
he sure as hell won't be able to fix it

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
and architecture doesn't help in those situations

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
NOTHING GOOD CAN COME OUT OF IT

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
...and you can build a house on your own?

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:30pm EST
by cutting down the wood

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:30pm EST
and creating the glass

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:30pm EST
after collecting and purifying the sand

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:30pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:30pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:30pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:30pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:30pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
so i can fly myself to other countries before i die

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
so you can steal a plane and go wherever the hell you want once the apocalypse leaves you alone

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
then the hobo won't be a hobo anymore either

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
he'll be able to shower and wear actual clothes

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
along with hobos being a class in society

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:33pm EST
and without society

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:33pm EST
he's just a human

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:33pm EST
a very rare species

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:39pm EST
you know one time i was playing super smash brothers

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:39pm EST
speaking of relevant

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:40pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:40pm EST
i was with my cousins and whatever. and when the first one died, i said "You are the Weakest Link, goodbye."

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:40pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:41pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:41pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:50pm EST
uggh i wish you hadn't seen the irrelephant one like 10 minutes ago

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:50pm EST
or i would totally have used it

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:50pm EST
doubtful you would have mentioned it

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:50pm EST
but still

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:51pm EST
that would've been perfect, that's a shame

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:52pm EST
ahh well

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:59pm EST
wanna help me think of questions to ask for my debate tomorrow?

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:59pm EST
of course

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 6:59pm EST
love debate

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:00pm EST
http://www.idebate.org/debatabase/topic_details.php?topicID=55 this is just one of the things i'm working from

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:01pm EST
ahh that one is a pretty common debate topic

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:01pm EST
i'm guessing you didn't get to choose your ow

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:01pm EST
n

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:01pm EST
no we do

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:01pm EST
but i need something that people can actually talk about

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:01pm EST
tiff and i have to run it tomorrow

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:01pm EST
but

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:02pm EST
i was thinking of doing one on like. religion as a basis for morality. but we talk about religion a lot in our debates in general

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:03pm EST
religion gets kind used a lot as well

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:03pm EST
mostly beause its so easy to debate

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:03pm EST
well the point is that these topics should be easy to debate

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:03pm EST
cause if no one talks we get a bad grade

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:03pm EST
SO NICHOLAS

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:03pm EST
if you would refer to the first question i asked you

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:03pm EST
i can think of a few

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:04pm EST
if you would help me think of questions to ask

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:04pm EST
that'd be swell

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:04pm EST
all right generic things to ask would be the obvious ones about What if the person has a 100% chance of living the rest of life in pain

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:05pm EST
I know they already have ways to have people deny people the right to save their lives

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:06pm EST
You could say that is a form of assisted suicide

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:06pm EST
These questions are to keep the conversation up if it dies down right?

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:07pm EST
yes

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:07pm EST
of course i need questions to start off with you know

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:07pm EST
hmm other things might be to discuss coma patients

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:08pm EST
and how long they should be kept alive

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:08pm EST
etc

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:09pm EST
another thing might be to discuss humane ways of killing someone

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:09pm EST
if you really wanted you could bring up the subject of the death penalty and tie that in somehow

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:09pm EST
well

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:11pm EST
i mean normally they're administered a lethal injection that would end their life painlessly so

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:12pm EST
just thinking outloud

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:12pm EST
...in text

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:12pm EST
whatever

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:12pm EST
umm

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:12pm EST
an easy way to bring more conversaton might be to bring up the religious taboo of suicide

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:12pm EST
idk

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:13pm EST
that could kinda go along with asking peoples opinions on if it's right or wrong. and why they think that i suppose.

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:14pm EST
yep

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:14pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:25pm EST
TREATMENTS YOU CAN REFUSE Cardiopulmonary Resucitation (CPR) Mechanical or artificial ventilation Artificial nutrition and hydration Antibiotics TREATMENTS YOU CANNOT REFUSE Food and water Pain relief Advance Decisions do not allow people to refuse basic care, which includes comfort, personal hygiene and pain relief. The people who care for you will do everything to keep you comfortable and pain-free at the end of your life.

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:27pm EST
those sort of make sense

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:38pm EST
Currently, 34 STATES have statutes explicitly criminalizing assisted suicide : Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin NINE states criminalize assisted suicide through common law: Alabama, Idaho, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, South Carolina, Vermont, West Virginia THREE states have abolished the common law of crimes and do not have statutes criminalizing assisted suicide : North Carolina, Utah, Wyoming In Ohio, that state's supreme court ruled in October 1996 that assisted suicide is not a crime. In Virginia, there is no real clear case law on assisted suicide , nor is there is a statute criminalizing the act, although there is a statute which imposes civil sanctions on persons assisting in a suicide. Only the states of Oregon and Washington permit physician-assisted suicide. not that you care for any of this lol

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 7:39pm EST
need somewhere to copy?

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 8:25pm EST
yes i am

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 8:25pm EST
the format

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 8:25pm EST
it's so ugly

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 8:25pm EST
The only four places that today openly and legally, authorize active assistance in dying of patients, are: Oregon (since l997, physician-assisted suicide only); Switzerland (1941, physician and non-physician assisted suicide only); Belgium (2002, permits 'euthanasia' but does not define the method; Netherlands (voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide lawful since April 2002 but permitted by the courts since l984). WHY WASN'T THIS AT THE TOP OF THE LIST

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 8:25pm EST
jesus christ

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 8:27pm EST
because life is stupid

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 8:27pm EST
why didn't you use wikipedia?

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 8:28pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 8:28pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 8:32pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 8:33pm EST
Legality Main article: Legality of euthanasia Assisted-suicide is legal in several jurisdictions, including Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland and three American states (Oregon, Washington, and Montana).

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 8:33pm EST
how easy was that

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 8:33pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 8:34pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 8:35pm EST

google: is assisted suicide legal in montana

Nick DevlinThursday, December 8, 2011 at 8:43pm EST
google is always the greatest aid

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 8:43pm EST
Physicians in Montana should not fear criminal prosecution when writing lethal prescriptions for mentally competent patients with terminal illnesses, the state's supreme court said in a 4-2 decision issued Dec. 31, 2009. Because patients consent to their own deaths and administer the lethal medications themselves, physicians would be shielded from homicide liability under state law, the court said in its decision in the case of Baxter v. Montana. The ruling makes Montana the third state, after Oregon and Washington, where physician-assisted suicide is legal.

Steph DudakThursday, December 8, 2011 at 8:51pm EST

Nick DevlinSaturday, December 10, 2011 at 10:52pm EST
but in relation what you are actually doing doesn't seem as bad

Steph DudakSaturday, December 10, 2011 at 10:53pm EST
the only thing that makes it so bad is that it's time consuming

Steph DudakSaturday, December 10, 2011 at 10:53pm EST
it looks pretty damn good as well

Steph DudakSaturday, December 10, 2011 at 10:54pm EST
like there's actual effort put into it

Steph DudakSaturday, December 10, 2011 at 10:54pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, December 11, 2011 at 4:12pm EST
it's not really stupid ?

Steph DudakSunday, December 11, 2011 at 4:12pm EST
it's stupid that each of these sections has to have a minimum of 15 slides

Steph DudakSunday, December 11, 2011 at 4:12pm EST
but i guess it has to have a lot since you're covering a whole year

Nick DevlinSunday, December 11, 2011 at 4:15pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, December 11, 2011 at 4:15pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, December 11, 2011 at 4:21pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, December 11, 2011 at 8:05pm EST

Nick DevlinMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:28pm EST
did you pick more emotions?

Steph DudakMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:29pm EST
well i had like little ideas

Steph DudakMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:30pm EST
like

Steph DudakMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:30pm EST
confusion

Steph DudakMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:30pm EST
and

Steph DudakMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:30pm EST
agony

Steph DudakMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:30pm EST
though the one for agony is obviously not pleasant,

Steph DudakMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:30pm EST
i don't think i'll be able to actually put what's in my head onto paper

Nick DevlinMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:30pm EST
i like confusion, pain I have no clue about

Steph DudakMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:31pm EST
confusion i'd have to decide what i want to do

Steph DudakMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:31pm EST
the first thing that came into my mind was a person made up of a buncha arrows going in every possible direction lol

Steph DudakMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:31pm EST
of course

Steph DudakMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:31pm EST
lame

Nick DevlinMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:32pm EST
do you have ideas for agony?

Steph DudakMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:33pm EST
kinda. it's more like a monster ripping out of someone and then attaching itself to the person. the only way i can describe parts of the ~monster would be stringy. but not stringy. idk how to explain it ok. but then i was like. i dunno if that's even possible, i dunno what id do it in, (lol colored pencil wut else)

Steph DudakMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:34pm EST
i need to kind of push the idea of control of emotions and keep it actually interesting

Nick DevlinMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
The way you describe it sounds like its planting roots

Nick DevlinMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
into the person

Nick DevlinMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
and growing out of hey're chest

Nick DevlinMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
THEY ATE THE WATERMELON SEED

Nick DevlinMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
I always knew that's what happened

Nick DevlinMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
wrong their -.-

Nick DevlinMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:36pm EST
hate when that happens

Steph DudakMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:36pm EST
kinda like that yeah

Steph DudakMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:36pm EST
and yeah that general vicinity

Nick DevlinMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
are you gonna have their face showing the pain

Nick DevlinMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
cause that seems very difficult

Steph DudakMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
the way it is in my head

Steph DudakMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
exactly

Steph DudakMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
that's why i need to think of an alternative

Steph DudakMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
bc i'm not really good at drawing people in general

Steph DudakMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
and

Steph DudakMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
the person would have to be like

Nick DevlinMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:38pm EST
another way to show pain might just to be making it as gory as possible

Steph DudakMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:38pm EST
thrown back. like their head with their face up and their arms back

Steph DudakMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:38pm EST

Nick DevlinMonday, December 12, 2011 at 9:51pm EST

Gaiman’s First Law: Picking up your first copy of a book you wrote, if there’s one typo, it will be on the page that your new book falls open to the first time you pick it up.

Nick DevlinMonday, December 12, 2011 at 10:25pm EST
it applies to everything

Nick DevlinMonday, December 12, 2011 at 10:25pm EST
you can never fix it

Nick DevlinMonday, December 12, 2011 at 10:26pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, December 12, 2011 at 10:28pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, December 12, 2011 at 10:56pm EST
this britney spears song doesnt really fit for entertainment

Nick DevlinMonday, December 12, 2011 at 10:58pm EST
cause the beginning is irrelevent

Nick DevlinMonday, December 12, 2011 at 10:58pm EST
but the song is good for entertainment

Steph DudakMonday, December 12, 2011 at 11:00pm EST

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 14, 2011 at 10:53pm EST

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 14, 2011 at 10:53pm EST
but whenever you're on fcebook again

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 14, 2011 at 10:53pm EST
if you could

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 14, 2011 at 10:53pm EST
Running couldn’t help her, hiding would be even worse. No one would answer a cry for help on a night like this, in a town like hers; even if she did have the breath to try screaming. There was no escape. She desperately dashed down alleys, looking for something, anything that could prove her fears wrong. He followed closely behind, enjoying the chase, not willing to let things end so quickly. She ran for what felt like hours until, finally, she found something to give her a glimmer of hope. At the edge of a path, on the outskirts of an open field lay a shovel, half buried in the grassy soil. Perhaps she could defend herself and fight back, there was little chance of her winning, but a slim chance was better than none. She rapidly struggled to pull the shovel up out of the earth, but it was caught on something. There was no time to dig it up. She started to give up her last desperate attempt, and begin to just run until she collapsed, but the shovel suddenly came free, along with the arm of its previous owner. The owner soon followed out of the ground. She was too stunned to move. The man chasing did not even react to this new competitor opposing him in the game of terrifying the woman. He simply slowed down preparing to end the hunt. As he drew closer, so too did the owner of the shovel. Far too, late the hunter realized he was one rung lower on the food chain than he thought, as he was battered senseless with the shovel. The decaying face turned towards the man’s prey, its moldering countenance showing no emotion as it brought down the shovel’s blade over her skull. The corpses immediately began sinking down in the muck, while the shovel and its owner returned to the earth to join both predator and prey in the realm of the ultimate hunter.

Short horror stor

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 14, 2011 at 10:54pm EST

Steph DudakWednesday, December 14, 2011 at 10:54pm EST
Will do

Steph DudakWednesday, December 14, 2011 at 11:00pm EST
She was too stunned to move. It's not that this doesn't make sense. I just don't really like the word stunned here that much. Far too, late Why is there a comma? But I like it

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 14, 2011 at 11:02pm EST
hmm stunned can be changed

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 14, 2011 at 11:02pm EST
i like the word petrified

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 14, 2011 at 11:02pm EST

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 14, 2011 at 11:02pm EST
but I need a completely different sentence

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 14, 2011 at 11:02pm EST

Steph DudakWednesday, December 14, 2011 at 11:03pm EST
Something along the lines of being petrified just by the sight of him

Steph DudakWednesday, December 14, 2011 at 11:03pm EST
Idk

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 14, 2011 at 11:07pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, December 15, 2011 at 4:23pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, December 15, 2011 at 4:25pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, December 15, 2011 at 4:25pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, December 15, 2011 at 4:25pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, December 15, 2011 at 4:25pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, December 15, 2011 at 4:27pm EST
Duh

Nick DevlinThursday, December 15, 2011 at 4:27pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, December 15, 2011 at 4:28pm EST
It was entirely sarcastic

Nick DevlinThursday, December 15, 2011 at 4:28pm EST
you said

Nick DevlinThursday, December 15, 2011 at 4:28pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, December 15, 2011 at 4:28pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:32pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:39pm EST
yes there were two letters

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:39pm EST
...

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:39pm EST
how did that happen askdglsfjhf

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:39pm EST
why?

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:40pm EST
because i didn't do it on purpose

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:40pm EST
that's odd

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:42pm EST
i know right

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:42pm EST
that guy is a lovely narrator btw

and the twin thing is already known

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:48pm EST
but still interesting

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:49pm EST
i'm not really sure why i sent that one lol

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:49pm EST
probably the expression on the white kids face

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
that is worth reblogging

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:55pm EST
how do you suppose

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:55pm EST
i'd be able to achieve a hollow person through a drawing

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:55pm EST
make it transparent

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:55pm EST
or a cutout

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:56pm EST
i was thinking of doing something like that for lonliness

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:56pm EST
maybe a blank facial expression. or you know, no facial features at all

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:56pm EST
and either you can see into the person, kinda like the brain one, or part of em is open

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:56pm EST
idk

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:57pm EST
have something with the eyes

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:57pm EST
or

http://www.usgs.gov/visitors/images/earthshells.gif

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:57pm EST
i was thinking that

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:57pm EST
but it wouldn't work with loneliness

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:58pm EST
Maybe you could use the environment to help depict this emotion

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:58pm EST
none of your previous ones really included anything but the main subject

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:59pm EST
i don't think it should be a generic barren landscape or something

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:59pm EST
but using something besides the actually person makes loneliness seem feasible

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 4:59pm EST
I always say actually instead of actual

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:00pm EST
i don't know why

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:00pm EST
but it always happens

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:00pm EST
i know

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:00pm EST
but

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:00pm EST
idk. i'm not really sure how i'd do that. cause like thinking about loneliness, it's easy for very generic things to come to mind

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:01pm EST
i'm not gonna do like a person curled up in a ball around a tree

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:01pm EST
what do you think of that is lonely?

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:01pm EST
annnnd loneliness has to control the person

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:01pm EST
I tend to think of space

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:01pm EST
yeah

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:01pm EST
like giant black holes and shit

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:01pm EST
and it is controlling the person

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:01pm EST
your environment pretty much makes up like 80% of who you are

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:02pm EST
and a lack of people in your environment

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:02pm EST
etc, you can explain away the controlling thing

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:03pm EST

http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lr0r33VZca1qgvwk9o1_500.jpg this is just really cool i love my art tag on tumblr i'm so happy i decided to start doing that

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:11pm EST
what if the person faded into the background

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:11pm EST
like they'd be all open and empty and not happy and stuff

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:11pm EST
and going toward the bottom they started to fade

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:12pm EST
ahh idea almost in my head

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:12pm EST
ummm

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:12pm EST
there are lost of people in some area

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:12pm EST
but his head is completely empty

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:13pm EST
the entire thing forms his body

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:13pm EST
like to show that he looks like he is involved but even with tons of people his mind is still lonely

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:21pm EST
Wait the people form the person what

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:25pm EST
sorry

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
let me elaborate

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
You know how you can have like scenes of a city or something

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
that form a larger picuter

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
of someones face or an animal or something

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:27pm EST
well you'd have that

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:27pm EST
but he persons body would be full of people

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:27pm EST
and the head would be empty and desolate

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:28pm EST
hm

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:28pm EST
i understand the idea

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:29pm EST
but i feel like i wouldn't want people in it. like in the person and then just have the head be empty.

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:30pm EST
if the people surrounded the person or made an outline of a person, i feel like the idea would get across better, but idk how i'd make that work well either. like without being really lame

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:30pm EST
but also

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:30pm EST
what if i did like an environment without an actual environment...

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:31pm EST
like, have the sense of people being all around this empty person in the background, & maybe make eyes obvious or something. but then have this person without open eyes, and you can see the emptiness inside of them

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:31pm EST
i'd want the person to lack color and the background to be colorful but i feel like that'd make you focus on the background a lot more kinda. but then again that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing depending on how it's executed

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:32pm EST
especially if i went with that fading into the background thing but idk about that

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:32pm EST
i like that idea

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:32pm EST
cause that might work, plus it'd be easier for me to do and probably allow me to get it done with the time restraint i have cause i've been uninspired all weekend sooooo :p

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:33pm EST
plan made

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:33pm EST
time to execute

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:33pm EST
then constantly doubt yourself

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:33pm EST
because your crazy

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:33pm EST
hahaha you know me so well

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:33pm EST
i love that you put up with me

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:35pm EST
haha put up with you?

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:35pm EST
I'm suprised you even talk to me to tell the truth, but if that's how you see it

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:35pm EST
then your very welcome for me being such an awesome person

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:35pm EST
to put up with you

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:36pm EST
oh nicholas. you're a nut job

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:36pm EST
so face or no face

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:37pm EST
manekin face

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:37pm EST
lik,e this

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:38pm EST
ugh can't find link

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:39pm EST
http://i551.photobucket.com/albums/ii472/dravarian26/darkmonocleman-1.jpg

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:39pm EST
there it is

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:39pm EST
without tophat and moncle

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:39pm EST
obviously

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:39pm EST
but have the eyes like shadowed

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:39pm EST
but not actually there

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:40pm EST
yeahh that's exactly what i meant

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:42pm EST
i'm suprised i have that picture online actually

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:42pm EST
glad it finally came in useful

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:44pm EST
fabulous

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:44pm EST
so colored background or no? cause i kinda wanna do it colored

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:44pm EST
just cause i like color

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:47pm EST
I think it should be very colourful

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:47pm EST
then become muted as it gets nearer him

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:47pm EST
that way it can still stand out somewhat

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:47pm EST
http://img3.cdn.crunchyroll.com/i/spire2/b18ef4dc0dc96926699a6e7d58924f221239591538_full.jpg

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:47pm EST
better pic of faceless guy

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:57pm EST
nice

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:57pm EST
& hmm alright

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:57pm EST
as in like

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 5:57pm EST
hold on

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:01pm EST
http://i39.tinypic.com/34dlxc2.png like that? lol that's an awful representation. like the outsides are really colorful and it gets less colorful as it goes in oor

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:01pm EST
THAT

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:01pm EST
turn it in

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:01pm EST
do it

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:02pm EST
don't even add anything else

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:02pm EST
its perfect

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:02pm EST
XD

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:03pm EST
or?

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:03pm EST
the oor was if that was not what you were talking about

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:04pm EST
well not as big as that obviously, I almost feel like it'd be interesting to make som other people more central

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:04pm EST
as in size

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:04pm EST
but have the colour leech away around him so he's still noticed

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:10pm EST
here

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:11pm EST
http://i551.photobucket.com/albums/ii472/dravarian26/loneliness.png

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:11pm EST
i made it in your style

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:12pm EST
hahahaha

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:13pm EST
i was gonna say

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:13pm EST
it'd make more sense for the lonely person to be the focal point

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:13pm EST
but

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:13pm EST
it would also make sense for the person to be more offset

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:13pm EST
reinforces the emotion

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:13pm EST
thats what i was thinking

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:15pm EST
that's if i put actual people in

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:15pm EST
damn it

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:15pm EST
i'd have to actually draw people

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:16pm EST
i was wondering when we'd hit that roadblock

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:16pm EST
maybe

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:16pm EST
you could

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:16pm EST
make them very... blurry?

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:16pm EST
i mean colorful and vibrant

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:16pm EST
but with no detail

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:16pm EST
but obviously there

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:16pm EST
like how the lonely man must see them

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:17pm EST
YES

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:17pm EST
you are a genius

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:17pm EST
hm... should i do this partially in chalk pastel then?

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:18pm EST
like the lonely person can be in pencil... the people could be in chalk pastel... and then maybe colored pencil as well? oh my head hold on

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:19pm EST
now i have to picture all this colored and such

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:21pm EST
should the basic background be black then

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:22pm EST
i have no idea

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:22pm EST
cause then i can have the colored blurry people

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:22pm EST
the grey lonely person

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:22pm EST
also fading into that black background

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:22pm EST
oh my goodness gracious i hope i can execute this properly

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:22pm EST
it could be really awesome

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:23pm EST
or really not awesome

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:23pm EST
sounds pretty awesome to me

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:24pm EST
ah it always SOUNDS awesome

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:24pm EST
now comes the challenge of making it look awesome

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:24pm EST
but that's one project down!

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:24pm EST
basically

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:25pm EST
now i gotta try to think of another one and maybe try to work simultaneously on them (lolol)

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:26pm EST
rage, SERENITY

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:26pm EST
okay i had an idea for that the other day

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:26pm EST
idk if i wrote it down in my sketch book

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:26pm EST
all i know is it'd be purple and blue

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:26pm EST
you want both of those?

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:28pm EST
not in the same piece

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:28pm EST
serenity for one, rage for another

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
hmm i'm thinking serenity might need a contrasting background as well

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
to emphasize the actual emotion

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
i can also do like

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
focus on a design aspect of that one

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
unless you can think of a way

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
more patterns?

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
curcy wavy stuff

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
the only thing that is currently coming to mind is kind of like

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
yes

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
swirly

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
pretty calm patterns

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:30pm EST
i can see that

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:30pm EST
but like the piece itself is like ~already been done. what's in my head. one sec

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
right so the first idea that just pops into my head is someone meditating. maybe around trees and stuff. but everything would have a design

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
but i feel like that's kinda like

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
oh

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
yeah

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
person meditating. serenity. derp.

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
that's where the contrasting background might help maybe?

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
have someone doing something peaceful

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
chaos

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
in the background

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
meditating gardening

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
and yes

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
have there be like a storm looming

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
with crazy patterned clouds and lighting

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
and harsh rain

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:35pm EST
with an aura of calm around them

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:35pm EST
This time the person in your drawing actual is controlling their emotion instead of the other way around

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:37pm EST
hmmmmmmm

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:38pm EST
that'd still fit the theme technically cause if you look at it from the emotion controlling the person perspective, it's like. no matter what's going on, that's still what you're feeling. it's taking over you and you're not worrying about other things that are going on

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:38pm EST
~ so deep

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:38pm EST
exactly

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:46pm EST
my god

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:46pm EST
now i know why i tag most of the things i reblog

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:48pm EST
i was trying to find this really awesome picture of a tree. it was like a drawing or painting. but it was made up of these colorful swirly patterns and such. either in september or october i reblogged it. but i didn't tag it! so i can't find it and safari decided to refresh the page while i was goin through the sept archive

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 6:48pm EST
that's annoying

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 7:02pm EST
http://owni.eu/files/2011/12/xkcd_map_projection.png

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 7:02pm EST
hahaha

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 7:02pm EST
I feel like i'm gonna get into maps now

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 7:03pm EST
My iPod isn't letting me zoom up on that

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 7:03pm EST
that sucks its pretty funny

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 7:07pm EST
I'll look at it eventually.

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 7:07pm EST
So fen hasn't emailed me back

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 7:12pm EST
annoying

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 7:31pm EST
I know! Ugh

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 7:47pm EST
You should stalk her on facebook then track down her house

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 7:47pm EST
knock on her door

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 7:47pm EST
then hand her the letter

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 7:47pm EST
orr

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 7:47pm EST
just ask for her real adress and mail it

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 7:47pm EST
either one

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 7:49pm EST
._.

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 7:53pm EST
How quickly do you suppose mrs Applegate could get a letter done lol fuck me man

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 7:54pm EST
maybe before the end of the week if you give it to her tomorrow

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 7:55pm EST
That'd be perfect. RPI wants a letter preferably from a math or science teacher that ~knows you well and i can't wait on mrs fenwick

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
I am not positive about that of course but it seems reasonable

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 7:57pm EST
If I ask her to try to get it done really really soon maybe lol

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 7:59pm EST
maybe

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 7:59pm EST
maybe if you went to juggling club more often

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 7:59pm EST
she'd get it done sooner

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 8:00pm EST
I should start going to those lol I'm sorry. I just never have a way of getting home

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 8:01pm EST
you don't have a late bus?

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 8:02pm EST
I've never taken the late bus o.o

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 8:03pm EST
because?

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 8:07pm EST
Idk cause I haven't ever

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 8:08pm EST
well thats a good readon

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 8:08pm EST
and julie or kerry show up sometimes

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 8:08pm EST
they give rides

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 8:09pm EST
Yeah but I constantly depend on them for rides and I'm not aware of when they stay after

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 8:12pm EST
yeah, I have the option (shitty option) to walk when they aren't there. Along with being acquaintances with 80% of the people that drive makes it easier to get rides

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 8:12pm EST
you should try sucking up to more people

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 8:12pm EST
especially people with cars

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 11:10pm EST
your tumblr friend said he likes my sugar glider

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 11:10pm EST
Which one

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 11:10pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 11:11pm EST
He also knows people with weird names

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 11:11pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 11:14pm EST
Like the fuck who is naming these people

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 11:14pm EST
Genevieve I don't find weird

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 11:14pm EST
I've heard it before and it's like French do

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 11:14pm EST
So

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 11:15pm EST
its still an uncommon name

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 11:16pm EST
josh, laura, becca, ashley, anthony, kevin

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 11:16pm EST
i don't know people with weird names like that

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 11:16pm EST
at least not in the first ten people on facebook

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 11:17pm EST
Touché

Steph DudakSunday, December 18, 2011 at 11:17pm EST
Normal named people live here

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 11:18pm EST
I'm still trying to find people with weird names

Nick DevlinSunday, December 18, 2011 at 11:18pm EST

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:32pm EST
yes

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:32pm EST
or actually sleeping

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:32pm EST
oh

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:32pm EST
you gotta be pretty specific

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:33pm EST
you obviously just proved my point that lack of energy is a very controlling feeling

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:33pm EST
i'm actually getting sicker i think, now i have this awful cough but anyway

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:33pm EST
yes

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:33pm EST
exactly

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:33pm EST
look at that, personal experience portrayed through artwork somehow

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:34pm EST
that should be your next few projects

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:34pm EST
My art is Laziness

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:34pm EST
I'll didn't actually start it

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:34pm EST
but I think it's much more apt that way

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:34pm EST
A+ please

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:35pm EST
my concentration is the progression of an ambitious lazy person

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:36pm EST
it starts off alright, tons of ideas, but then

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:36pm EST
life

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:36pm EST
can't be bothered to force myself to be creative

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:36pm EST
thus can't think of not lame ideas

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:36pm EST
therefore nothing gets put onto paper,

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:36pm EST
and i leave things til the last minute --- > procrasination

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:37pm EST
which leads to some awful scribbles and even less sleep

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:37pm EST
which ultimately results in my downfall

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:37pm EST
autobiography or what you're project will be?

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:38pm EST
partially my autobiography and my entire concentration for art

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:38pm EST
#winning

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:38pm EST
nice multitasking there

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:39pm EST
so a project on tiredness

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:39pm EST
there is definately a word for that that I can't think of

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:39pm EST
not lazy

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:39pm EST
by without energy

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:39pm EST
irrelevant

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:40pm EST
do something with a dream bubble

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:40pm EST
some guy dreaming of cleaning his room

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:40pm EST
while in his pigsty of a room

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:40pm EST
or something equally ridiculous

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:41pm EST
i"iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:41pm EST
sorry

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:41pm EST
ignore that

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:41pm EST
that never happened

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:41pm EST
i will

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:41pm EST
what never happened?

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:41pm EST
good kid

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:43pm EST
any ideas?

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:43pm EST
the only thing i relate tired with

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:43pm EST
is near death

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:44pm EST
these days anyways, especially this week

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:46pm EST
eyes just falling outta sockets, the skin underneath them sagging. swaying side to side, mouth slightly open, probably drooling. that's basically somewhere in between the transition of human to zombie

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:47pm EST
you should make your teme human anatomy or something

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:47pm EST
that's what you always seem to go for

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:48pm EST
or at least the disfiguration of it

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:49pm EST
the only thing that's keeping me from my concentration being that is the specific things

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:50pm EST
going on in the picture. like i can't really explain it

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:50pm EST
the pieces kind of have to include that stuff if it's control of emotion/feeling over a person.

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:50pm EST
depending on what's actually going on, having them disfigured makes it potentially more effective

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:51pm EST
i'd love to do an actual anatomy study though

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:51pm EST
eventually

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:51pm EST
I suppose it certainely makes them more noticeable

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:51pm EST
and anatomy is interesting

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:51pm EST
I'd like to learn how to scientifically draw nature stuff

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:52pm EST
animals and plants and junk

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:52pm EST
i suppose that include humans

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:53pm EST
i think also

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:53pm EST
if i had a better understanding of human anatomy, it'd be easier to distort it

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:53pm EST
you have to know the rules in order to break them

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:55pm EST
exactly. unfortunately it takes a bit of time to learn those rules

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:56pm EST
not enough time to do that and get your projects done

Steph DudakFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:56pm EST
exactly

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:57pm EST
I feel the same about coding, its just that I do have the time

Nick DevlinFriday, December 23, 2011 at 11:57pm EST
I just waste it

Steph DudakSaturday, December 24, 2011 at 12:00am EST
i don't know where time goes

Nick DevlinSaturday, December 24, 2011 at 12:00am EST
nowhere it stays where it is

Nick DevlinSaturday, December 24, 2011 at 12:00am EST
we just keep passing through it

Steph DudakSaturday, December 24, 2011 at 12:10am EST
that we do

Nick DevlinSaturday, December 24, 2011 at 12:15am EST
maybe i shouldn't wish peple happy birthday at midnight

Nick DevlinSaturday, December 24, 2011 at 12:15am EST
Escher is awesome

Nick DevlinSaturday, December 24, 2011 at 12:16am EST
and people who can draw like that with a pencil are using witchcraft

Nick DevlinSaturday, December 24, 2011 at 12:16am EST
and must be burned

Steph DudakSaturday, December 24, 2011 at 12:20am EST
if i could do that with colored pencils. granted i even gave myself proper amounts of time to get things done. my god

Nick DevlinSaturday, December 24, 2011 at 12:22am EST
life would be a lot more fun

Steph DudakSaturday, December 24, 2011 at 12:23am EST
life would be great

Nick DevlinSaturday, December 24, 2011 at 12:24am EST
it would be fantastic if this game I am playing had a save button

Nick DevlinSaturday, December 24, 2011 at 12:24am EST
but it does not

Nick DevlinSaturday, December 24, 2011 at 12:24am EST
so the past 4 hours

Nick DevlinSaturday, December 24, 2011 at 12:24am EST
are meaningless

Nick DevlinSunday, December 25, 2011 at 9:04pm EST
apparently the only way to win an argument

Nick DevlinSunday, December 25, 2011 at 9:04pm EST
is to point out the win or loss of that persons football team

Nick DevlinSunday, December 25, 2011 at 9:05pm EST
regardless of the topic

Nick DevlinSunday, December 25, 2011 at 9:05pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, December 25, 2011 at 9:05pm EST
"want something to eat?

Steph DudakSunday, December 25, 2011 at 10:37pm EST
fuck

Steph DudakSunday, December 25, 2011 at 10:38pm EST
hold on imma try to make it short

Nick DevlinSunday, December 25, 2011 at 10:38pm EST
go as much exposition as you need

Steph DudakSunday, December 25, 2011 at 10:42pm EST
so. basically this kid mason (that i am NOW no longer friends with). like i was friends with him last year starting like two summers ago k. basically what had happened was some stuff happened, we hit this ridiculous fucking bullshit patch during spring break last year. and he basically ended our friendship right there. i tell you about that? well either way, i was pretty upset. but then i got over it. and like a month or so later he texted me all i miss my best friend blahblahblah. because i'm not a complete asshole, i was like. yo. i never went anywhere i offered to stay friends with you and you never answered me. but yeah so we kinda became friends again but it was kinda awkward at the same time. he doesn't even fucking live here man. but anyway. so. yeah and he's very ~pity me.

Steph DudakSunday, December 25, 2011 at 10:42pm EST
one of those kinds of people. and doesn't listen to me when i try to give him advice so eventually i gave up. but we didn't talk nearly as often as we used to. so he also has this thing where. he and his girlfriend are pretty trashy people. and he can get away with goin like "hey skank" to her and she'll say whatever back. but shit like that does not fly with me. not at all. i find it rude and annoying, don't care if you're kidding or not. like if it's random once in a while, whatever. but if it's like all the time. fuck you. so he tries to get away with talking to me like that. but recently we haven't been like bad or anything. so there's a little back story which leads up to today.

Steph DudakSunday, December 25, 2011 at 10:43pm EST
this morning. i texted a buncha people merry christmas cause. idk thats just what i do. so at about 9 am i texted mason merry christmas. wanna know how the conversation went? it's a really great conversation, really.

Nick DevlinSunday, December 25, 2011 at 10:43pm EST
i am interested

Nick DevlinSunday, December 25, 2011 at 10:43pm EST
continue

Steph DudakSunday, December 25, 2011 at 10:45pm EST
so it started off with me being all Merry Christmas! and then he goes Fuck off Okay asshole I hate Christmas so much. Omg. That doesn't give you an excuse to be a douchebag. Hope you have a good day anyway, bye. K so like i said that was at about 9AM. At about 9PM he texted me back and goes Sorry bout earlier. Its whatever

Steph DudakSunday, December 25, 2011 at 10:45pm EST
---- and i hate when people say that to me. so i only say that when i'm kinda pissed off myself. so he goes.. Don't get pissy I didn't mean anything by it DON'T GET PISSY?! DON'T FUCKING GET PISSY. LOL. OK. So I texted him back saying I think I have the right to be a little pissy. How did you expect me to react? And what do you mean you didn't mean anything by it? Idk if your friends let you talk to them like that, but I don't deal with that bullshit. Being nasty to me and telling me to fuck off just cause i said merry christmas to you does not fucking fly. I'm not gonna be treated like that. So don't tell me not to get pissy~.

Steph DudakSunday, December 25, 2011 at 10:45pm EST
So he replies. Shut up So i'm like lol k i'm done. fuck you, don't fucking talk to me anymore. "Cool story." ALRIGHT. Like what the fuck ? sorry i said merry christmas to you like .... are you fucking kidding me right now? NEVER in my entire life has anyone been so rude and disrespectful. never. so i'm done. he's completely officially deleted out of my life, this time for good, cause i shouldn't have to deal with that bullshit.

Nick DevlinSunday, December 25, 2011 at 10:47pm EST
sounds like a douche

Nick DevlinSunday, December 25, 2011 at 10:47pm EST
but at least you knew to just delete him from everything

Nick DevlinSunday, December 25, 2011 at 10:48pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:34pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:34pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:34pm EST
Good plan

Steph DudakThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:34pm EST
Caught me at a good time

Steph DudakThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:34pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:34pm EST
My back hurts like a bitch haha

Nick DevlinThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:34pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:35pm EST
Yessir!

Steph DudakThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:35pm EST
It's amazing. Idk how I've lived without this thing

Steph DudakThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:35pm EST
My desk is covvvvered with stuff

Steph DudakThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:35pm EST
And my eraser hasn't gotten lost XD

Nick DevlinThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:35pm EST
that is unheard of!

Steph DudakThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:36pm EST
It really is. Mind you I have like three erasers on my desk rn but if I was working on my bed, I'd be searching every other second

Nick DevlinThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:36pm EST
efficiency

Nick DevlinThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:37pm EST
My desk is useless I mainly use it as a massive storage area.

Nick DevlinThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:38pm EST
the surface is wood so you can write on it cause the pencil gets cause in the grain

Nick DevlinThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:38pm EST
-.-

Nick DevlinThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:38pm EST
annoying

Steph DudakThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:38pm EST
Ugh that's awful I hate that

Steph DudakThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:38pm EST
Lol currently

Nick DevlinThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:39pm EST
i can't imagine having the patience to make multiple drafts of something without it being on the computer

Steph DudakThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:40pm EST
Truthfully idk how I did it

Steph DudakThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:40pm EST
But I had to practice

Steph DudakThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:40pm EST
It had to be perfect on the final paper

Nick DevlinThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:40pm EST
did you look up stained glass patterns for reference?

Nick DevlinThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:40pm EST
or just make a cool design?

Steph DudakThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:41pm EST
I just did those myself lol. I looked up stained glass sculptures for reference for the frame. Didn't work too well. So I just said screw it and outlined everything in black

Steph DudakThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:42pm EST
I also decided against the shattering glass bc it's extremely difficult to duplicate and it looks better this way

Nick DevlinThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:43pm EST
yeah I can imagine

Nick DevlinThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:43pm EST
any ideas on the background?

Steph DudakThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:43pm EST
I was hoping that'd eventually come to me. I have no clue

Steph DudakThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:44pm EST
When do I ever lol

Nick DevlinThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:44pm EST
pattern/ design or a scene?

Nick DevlinThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:44pm EST
I don't think you've made any pieces with scenes

Steph DudakThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:45pm EST
I have not

Nick DevlinThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:45pm EST
so making one for this might seem out of place?

Steph DudakThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:45pm EST
Actually they're all plain

Steph DudakThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:45pm EST
Minus the heart which I've yet to do

Nick DevlinThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:55pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, December 29, 2011 at 11:57pm EST

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 12:23am EST

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 12:23am EST
its close enough to not being real work

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 12:23am EST

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 12:24am EST
Do your work Nicholas

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 12:24am EST

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 12:25am EST
Hahahaha

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:12pm EST
STEPH

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:12pm EST
I ALMOST did work

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:12pm EST
I came like THIS CLOSE

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:12pm EST
then I stopped

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:15pm EST
some essay for a scholarship

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:15pm EST
The world of my generation revolves around technology. Every facet of our lives from education to entertainment has technology embedded in it. I love the influence technology has had on the way people do things. Its facilitates tasks in ways that were unimaginable just a few decades ago. This does not mean that current technology is perfect. One of the biggest issues people have with new devices is figuring out how to work them. How often do you here people complain about how they can’t understand a new website they found, or that they cannot figure out how to work their new cell phone? Although technology can drastically improve the storage and transport of information the messages sent are often miscommunicated. I love to find new ways to communicate a message or idea through different mediumLater this will be done I swear

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:33pm EST
Sec

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:37pm EST
It* facilitates tasks. However, this doesn't mean blahblahblah. It's not completely necessary but I think it flows better with however. How often do you hear* people complain Add a comma after ... And transport of information*,* Good start I think though. But I feel like that last sentence should be the beginning of a new paragraph or something

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:38pm EST
yeah i just wrote for 5 minutes

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:38pm EST
then got so excited that i wrote something

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:39pm EST
that i stopped

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:39pm EST
Don't you love when that happens. I gotta start my art projects. Every time I get ready to do something, my dad tells me to clean the kitchen

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:40pm EST
Then I realized I had to eat. So I made a sandwich. Ik great story. I'm hesitant to start working but ik I have to. Gotta get more ideas out tho

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:41pm EST
what are you working on now?

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:43pm EST
Idk I haven't started yet! I still have the other two things. The loneliness and serenity ones. I wanna do what we talked about for the lonely one but I know how difficult it's gonna be and I'm pressed for time. I need to make these like. Not necessarily simple, but things i know I can accomplish. I suppose I'll be working on both or one of those today

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:44pm EST
The main deal for the serenity is the background. Then I gotta think of a few more things for other pieces

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:44pm EST
you're doing the faceless guy for loneliness right?

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:44pm EST
Yessir

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:44pm EST
I wanted to have him like opening himself Like superman lol but I feel like its kinda been done

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:45pm EST
well yeah

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:45pm EST
I mean there wouldn't be anything there. Maybe I could make it look like some weird swirling vortex of nothing

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:45pm EST
also done a looks cool

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:45pm EST
i really like the color sapping idea

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:45pm EST
but that would take a while

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:46pm EST
I like how all my projects are done in the same medium lol. I've done all of these in colored pencil minus the brain

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:46pm EST
the color sapping would work with something chlaky

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:46pm EST
or pastel

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:46pm EST
one of those smeary mediums

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:47pm EST
Chalk pastels..?

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:47pm EST
lol

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:47pm EST
nah that sounds completely irrelvant

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:47pm EST
What is color sapping

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:48pm EST
the lonely guy in black and white

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:48pm EST
with all the colorful people around him

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:49pm EST
and anthing near him loses its vitality

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:49pm EST
Well

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:50pm EST
What if I put him on the edge of the page

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:52pm EST
Annnd. Cause the other ideas are difficult to um I can't think of the word But so I wouldn't need to worry about it. The background would be the shapes of people. Almost like its transitioning to him. Like the left side starts off all colorful annnd as you go to the right it just gets duller and greyer til it's him. They wouldn't be aligned with him exactly but do yk what I mean? That's the only way I can get it to really work.

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:53pm EST
that sounds like it'd work

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:53pm EST
kind of like a scale

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:53pm EST
unless you want to just be all out lazy

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:53pm EST
and draw a happy scene

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:53pm EST
then just say

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:53pm EST
the lonely guy is at home cause he has no friends

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:54pm EST
Hahahaha genius

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:54pm EST
That'd actually be more work

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:54pm EST
This requires no facial features

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:54pm EST
No defined like muscles and stuff of the people

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:54pm EST
Just general shapes

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:54pm EST
Like auras

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:55pm EST
He's shedding his aura of happiness

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:55pm EST
Cause underneath he's depressed and lonely as hell

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:55pm EST
Boom.

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:56pm EST
gold

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:56pm EST
go do it

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:58pm EST
Ok ok I will. Look at this first tho I found it funny Off to art!

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 3:59pm EST
I love those

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 4:06pm EST
I still gotta think of a background for the one I did last night too don't let me forget

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 4:07pm EST
I'll pester you about it with multiple random ideas to you like one of them or think of one better

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 4:07pm EST
whenever you finish the section you are doing now

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 4:11pm EST
I appreciate that, thank you

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:15pm EST
I'm SORRY

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:15pm EST
what have you done?

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:16pm EST
Hold on

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:17pm EST
Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:18pm EST
if his face is featureless

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:18pm EST
you defined the eye too much

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:19pm EST
I don't know how to fix it. If I should just lighten the dark parts or make the eye shape that's in there darker

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:19pm EST
Right now it looks like a closed eye

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:19pm EST
lighten the dark parts

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:19pm EST
i know

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:19pm EST
that's why i said too defined

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:20pm EST
I know

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:20pm EST
Womp. Would that make it look more like there wasn't an eye there idk.

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:21pm EST
http://www.mcbrideslaw.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Faceless-politicians-be.jpg

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:21pm EST
When I was doing the mouth and nose and stuff. I kinda just erased the lines and smudged the graphite a lot till it looked like stuff could be there

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:21pm EST
featureless faces are easy

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:21pm EST
you only need like 2 smudgy spots

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:21pm EST
Underneath the eye

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:22pm EST
There shouldn't be much

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:22pm EST
no

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:22pm EST
there shouldn't

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:22pm EST
http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/image/planetary/mars/face.jpg

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:22pm EST
people see what they want to see

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:23pm EST
If I take away most of what is underneath and lighten up the top it would work a little better I think.

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:23pm EST
yep

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:25pm EST
Should I more or less take out that line for the side of the nose then

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:26pm EST
all you really should need

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:26pm EST
is a smudge under the nose

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:27pm EST
but if that isn't enough

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:27pm EST
shade half of the nose

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:27pm EST
in a shadow

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:28pm EST
I'll figure it out somehow

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:28pm EST
Thank you

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:28pm EST
there's tons of things online of faceless people

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:28pm EST
and no problem

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
good luck

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
I feel like for me it's difficult because it's simple

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
yeah it is

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
I don't do a lot of simple things. This kind of moves away from what I've been doing

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
i think you feel like simple is bad

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
like you didn't put enough effort into it

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
because you're insane like that

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:30pm EST
Subconsciously, that's probably exactly what I think lmao

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
just finish your faceless face -.-

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:36pm EST
WHAT IF I DID

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:36pm EST
One min

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 6:37pm EST
Think I'll redraw this one too. I'll be sending pictures later.

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:28pm EST
okay

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:29pm EST
Yeah this isn't working

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:30pm EST
well alright then

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:30pm EST
I just spent another hour and it came out worse the second time. Idk how that's even possible.

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:41pm EST
how long have you been working on this stuff today?

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:41pm EST
3 hours

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:42pm EST
acceptable

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:44pm EST
I might just scrap this idea in general. If I spend three hours and end up nowhere besides aggravated... I should've just left it how it was the first time and like. I don't even know. It still wouldntve come out very well. I suppose I'll go force some sort of creative ideas now. Talk to you later

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:45pm EST
good luck forcing creativity

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:45pm EST
i'm sure that will work out well

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:45pm EST
just ask if you need help with anything

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:45pm EST
Basically what AP art requires

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:46pm EST
or you want ideas for the background of your stained glass thing

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:46pm EST
They didn't mention that in the prerequisite though

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:46pm EST
that's always annoyin

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:47pm EST
I don't even want to give that a background. I'll probably give it a solid color otherwise there'll be too much going on

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:55pm EST
yeah i can see that

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
Not that ik what color to use

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
I can't use black

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
that's why i didn't ask

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
you've already used most of the palette

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
i think like blue is like

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
left*

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
Grey? I used that on the other green one

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:57pm EST
The colors of the hand contrast that of the butterfly. So I can't go with that idea

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:58pm EST
yeah i know

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:59pm EST
what is this one representing?

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:59pm EST
pain?

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 7:59pm EST
or did you change the theme

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:01pm EST
The hand one? Fragility. That's what it always was. And that's why the hand was gonna shatter but that's another thing that didn't work out. Bc of that my concentration has broadened to feelings I suppose instead of just emotion

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:01pm EST
yeah okay, i remember the shattering and how that was supposed to relate to the pain

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:01pm EST
but since you changed it to whole

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:01pm EST
i wondered what the idea was

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:02pm EST
and feelings does open up things enough

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:02pm EST
the only background i can see would be like a forest scene

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:03pm EST
Still couldn't be green

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:03pm EST
That requires more detail as well

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:03pm EST
i know

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:03pm EST
WHY DON"T YOU HAVE MORE TIME

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:04pm EST
your lack of time is messing up all my ideas!!

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:04pm EST
i'm gonna yell at your art teacher

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:04pm EST
/cry You should

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:04pm EST

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:04pm EST

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:07pm EST

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:08pm EST

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:08pm EST

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:41pm EST
mhmm

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:44pm EST
Laurie mentioned that and how I could do something like that. A lonely silhouette with the colors all around. Then I had an idea to do the background up real big. So it'd be really colorful and swirly and pretty but where the silhouette is, it'd be grey. Then I thought, the grey part could just form the shape of a person in this pretty background BUT I dunno how well it'd work. Like of it'd just get lost yk? Cause I was thinking about it along the lines of the brain. How it's obvious, but not completely obvious

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:45pm EST
I really just think itd look cool more than anything But it'd have to fit

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:46pm EST
make a grey background

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:46pm EST
then outline a silloute

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:46pm EST
put in somewhere on paper

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:46pm EST
then drawin colorful pretty paterns to your hearts content

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:46pm EST
and remove the paper leving grey person behind

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:47pm EST
So like

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:47pm EST
Just a plain grey figure

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:47pm EST
Amongst pretty stuff

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
mhmm

Steph DudakFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
Hm

Nick DevlinFriday, December 30, 2011 at 8:50pm EST
