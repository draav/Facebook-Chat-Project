Steph DudakTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
I've yet to start any college stuff

Steph DudakTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
Well I'm gonna use this essay for my Drexel application

Steph DudakTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:20pm EDT
Emerson is such a quotable guy.

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:20pm EDT
essay?

Steph DudakTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:20pm EDT
It's awesome.

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:20pm EDT
i thought you didn't need one?

Steph DudakTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:20pm EDT
Well it's a 250-500 word thing

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:20pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
what quote are you using?

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
the one you just posted?

Steph DudakTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
Idk yet lol

Steph DudakTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
Cause it needs to be relevant but

Steph DudakTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
Hold on

Steph DudakTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:25pm EDT
To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. Make the most of yourself, for that is all there is of you. Every wall is a door. All life is an experiment. The more experiments you make, the better. Always do what you are afraid to do. Nobody can bring you peace but yourself. This is just like a few I've accumulated. But in my draft I mean. It's kind of like why I'm interested in studying architecture. Or like how it began. So yeah like why. I never finished my draft. But then again, my draft was just written to hand something in for lit

Steph DudakTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
I wasn't happy with it lol

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
well i don't think i've seen you happy with anything you've ever handed in for lit

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
but those quotes are awesome

Steph DudakTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
Touché. Btw I still didn't get my epic story back. Ahclahf.

Steph DudakTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
And aren't they!

Steph DudakTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
I particularly like the first one

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
I like 4 & 5

Steph DudakTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
I wrote these out on paper. And it made me want to do an art project including them somehow.

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
but they're all good

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
that why I did my project on John green!

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
just for the quote

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
my two favorites of his are "…because nerds like us are allowed to be unironically enthusiastic about stuff… Nerds are allowed to love stuff, like jump-up-and-down-in-the-chair-can’t-control-yourself love it. Hank, when people call people nerds, mostly what they’re saying is ‘you like stuff.’ Which is just not a good insult at all. Like, ‘you are too enthusiastic about the miracle of human consciousness’." ~ John Green "Maybe our favorite quotations say more about us than about the stories and people we're quoting." ~

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
you already saw the first

Steph DudakTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
I like the second one

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
yeah me too

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
but i feel like the first applies to me a lot more

Steph DudakTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
It definitely does. Lol what's kind of ironic is there's a quote by Emerson that's like. I hate quotations, tell me what you know.

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
and he's like the most quotable guy ever

Steph DudakTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
Exactly

Steph DudakTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
I think I read two of his essays last year. I definitely read one

Steph DudakTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
On education

Steph DudakTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
Idk where I was going with that

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, November 1, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 8:54pm EDT
it sounds like it lol

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 8:54pm EDT
its mostly because I just can't remember what work I have to do

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 8:54pm EDT
and am assuming that I have none

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 8:55pm EDT
therefore free time i now possess

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 8:55pm EDT
that's great!

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 8:55pm EDT
i'm pretty sure the only hw i have to do today was my final draft for my college essay

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 8:55pm EDT
which i've yet to write

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
well that won't be hard whenever you get around to it

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
probably not

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
i'm just not in the mood to do work

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
when am i tho

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 8:59pm EDT
the getting around to it part will probably be more difficult than actually writing it

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 9:01pm EDT
yes

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 9:01pm EDT
it absolutely will lol

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 9:01pm EDT
i have to type it

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
i was going to hand write it first

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
that way i could just get it done. but i didn't feel like it

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
so here i am

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
wasting my own time lol

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
but of course answering 80 questions on mblr

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
is no problem

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
102

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
same difference

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
it's a purposeful distraction from things i'm supposed to be doing

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 9:03pm EDT
i also wasn't expecting to answer all 102 of those..

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 9:04pm EDT
well i am at 80 now

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 9:05pm EDT
and done

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 9:07pm EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 9:07pm EDT
lmao

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 9:07pm EDT
reading those things is interesting i think

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 9:08pm EDT
regardless if i know the person or not

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 9:08pm EDT
" "

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 9:08pm EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 9:27pm EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 9:27pm EDT
10 minutes wasted

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 9:27pm EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
particularly black, red, and sky blue.

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 10:39pm EDT
btw

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT
and i was quite amused during some of it. i like how you answer questions lol probably because when i read things you write, i can actually hear you saying them in my head. is that weird? it doesn't really matter.

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT
thats just how i write

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT
its useful for spoken essays

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 10:45pm EDT
you write how you talk as well i notice now, I just tend to read everything in a dramatic announcing voice

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 10:45pm EDT
cause its more fun that way

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
i like reading boring things like that

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
really dramatically. so they're less boring

Steph DudakWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
or reading boring things out loud in accents

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
yep like that

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
except with everythin

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 2, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
mayybbeee

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:02pm EDT

...don't

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:06pm EDT
well my original plan had been to major in graphic design. in which case...

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:06pm EDT
i still wouldn't be prepared lmao

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:08pm EDT
i wish computer design didn't seem so boring

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:09pm EDT
and more than like 2 colleges had it as a major

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:09pm EDT
thatd be cool

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:10pm EDT
but ah well, maybe i'll suddenly gain artistic talent

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:10pm EDT
or you know,

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:10pm EDT
not

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:10pm EDT
practice practice

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:10pm EDT
you don't need to be able to like

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:10pm EDT
draw stuff

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:10pm EDT
like actual stuff

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:11pm EDT
mrs calicchio told me the other day that i don't have to draw STUFF. i can just do the weird shit i've recently started doing

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:11pm EDT
working on a 2d portfolio

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:11pm EDT
yeah i need to force myself to draw daily

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:11pm EDT
i used to in like middle school

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:11pm EDT
but now

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:12pm EDT
not so muc

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:12pm EDT
h

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:12pm EDT
i don't ever want to draw anymore

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:12pm EDT
well not so much that i dont want to

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:12pm EDT
i just dont have any ideas

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:12pm EDT
and the ones i do have i can't properly execute

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:12pm EDT
i feel like minecraft sort of counts though from the amount of work i put into the projects

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:12pm EDT
and i love minecraft because I can execute them

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:13pm EDT
like that portal cube

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:13pm EDT
i could never draw that

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:13pm EDT
and ideas are easy

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:13pm EDT
as long as you don't mind 99% of them being ridiculous

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:14pm EDT
they're not though

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:14pm EDT
mine are

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:14pm EDT
i can't draw people

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:14pm EDT
i wish i could. it'd make my life easy

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:15pm EDT
i need to practice hands and stuff. i wanted to do a project that included like a persons arm. but the focus would be on their hand because they'd be holding a human heart

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:15pm EDT
not so much holding as nearly squeezing it

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:15pm EDT
but i wanted to use like patterns in it

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:16pm EDT
plesase continue writing for me to read later

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:16pm EDT
i am late for band

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:16pm EDT
okay! have fun

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:16pm EDT
so

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:16pm EDT
see ya

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:20pm EDT
yk how i've been doing it. the heart being made of a more delicate design, while the hand and arm made of a more rough design. but as you get to the end of the arm, it gets back to being more delicate. and then the background would be this really crazy design that's like. idek how to describe it. not a mess, but that conveys the idea of a mess in your head. then of course i'd use like reds, purples, blacks, greys, and blues and you'd be able to tell where there's blood on the hand from the heart. generally it's symbolizing someone literally ripping your heart out of your chest. so yk when that happens metaphorically, you're not very happy. that's where the background comes in. everythings all nuts. and the heart would have a delicate design because well it's fragile. the rougher design on the hands would represent that too.. and like. itd also be representative of hurt. but i dunno if i will be able to put this all out onto paper. and with this other thing. like i started another thing but i dunno where i'm going with it. i'll have to send you a picture

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 4:21pm EDT
i kinda just drew it last night. so it's like. this thing that's just there and idk what's gonna happen with it

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
why does the design turn delicate again when you reach the tops of the arms?

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
i understand the arms being rough and the soft heart and the chaotic background just not the "but as you get to the end of the arm, it gets back to being more delicate."

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
it's not going to

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
i changed my mind

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
changed your mind to

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
?

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
nothing

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
ill explain in aminute

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
k

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
more than a minute

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
okay so

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
like

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT
a bit more

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT
you know how like

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT
when people hurt you, it's not really the people you expect? so it's like they seem fine and nice and blahblahblah

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
if you expect the person to hurt you it doesn't really hurt, so yeah

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
it's a more complex idea and if i were to go back in to a delicate kind of pattern, it'd have to be like... a full body thing. but even then it wouldn't be portrayed correctly

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
mmhmmm

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
so i just ignored the idea

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
ignored

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
as if i drew it all up already

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
am going to ignore

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
and now?

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
now what

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
do you have another idea?

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
to fix it?

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
or just scrapped completely

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
no i still wanna go do that whole thing, just the arm and hand will be one thing, it's not gonna go back to some sort of delicate design. it'd look weird.

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
but

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
another thing in doing that

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
isss finding out what the designs on each thing will actually be. like i'll need an

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
um

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
outline

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
of the general thing i suppose

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
did any of that even make sense

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
what direction is the arm coming from?

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
yes

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
sorta

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
sorry not really paying attention to what i'm saying lol

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
but

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
askjhgf

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
i think

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
i'm gonna have the paper horizontal

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
OR

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
i could have it vertical and have it like

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
hold on, i'll show you

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
this positioning?

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
something like that, but not exactly

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
the wrist would be at an angle

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
only ttalking about the direction

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
possibly yeah. if i were to do it vertically

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
having it come down would look odd it think

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
well i mean as opposed to horizontally

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
which would look like?

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
no

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
that'd be interesting though

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
i'm not sure

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
try sketching a bunch of them

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
see which one is best

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
i was gonna try to show you what i was thinking

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
but trynna do something like that on the computer

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
is not working lol

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
not that it has to be detailed

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
just use paint

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
i know

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
but there's like

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
i cant even explain it

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:30pm EDT
lololol hold on

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:30pm EDT
holding

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
http://i41.tinypic.com/axudh.png this is a good drawing.... anyway, obviously there'd be fingers. that are like around the heart. but it wouldn't be so straight on

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
i can't really translate it from my head

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
i cna sort of see it

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
the only thing

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
is i haven't really drawn hands. so like that's something else in itself

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:36pm EDT
sounds like you have a lot of hand drawing to practice

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:37pm EDT
i have

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:37pm EDT
a lot of stuff

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:37pm EDT
to do

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:37pm EDT
my artistic ability does not support my imagination.

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:37pm EDT
tumblr

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:37pm EDT
and is this what its sorta like?

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:37pm EDT
http://i551.photobucket.com/albums/ii472/dravarian26/heartthing.png

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:38pm EDT
nope

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:38pm EDT
think of

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:38pm EDT
didn't think so

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:38pm EDT
couldn't explain so i had to draw to ask

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:39pm EDT
thinking of

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:40pm EDT
wait

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:40pm EDT
i needed to screen shot the picture

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT
this is a horrid example

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT
http://i40.tinypic.com/35a5b7m.png thing of this but 1) with one hand 2) turned so the palm is facing you more 3) much much less gentle 4) more angular wrist wise

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
think

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
*

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:43pm EDT
so imagining she is standing on a turntable on the ground

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:44pm EDT
she is revolved so her back is pretty much to the front

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:44pm EDT
then her entire body except arm is removed?

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:44pm EDT
that kind of angle?

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:45pm EDT
or her body of removed the her wrist turns so that the palm is visible

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:45pm EDT
but the arm remains at that angle

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:46pm EDT
wish i just had a fake arm to move around to show

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:47pm EDT
ignore the body completely

Steph DudakFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:47pm EDT
give me another few minutes

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:49pm EDT
i grant you this time

Nick DevlinFriday, November 4, 2011 at 11:49pm EDT
use it well

Steph DudakSaturday, November 5, 2011 at 12:02am EDT
http://i43.tinypic.com/24kzjpt.png something similar to this perhaps. not exactly but you get the idea?

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 5, 2011 at 12:02am EDT
i get the idea

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 5, 2011 at 12:03am EDT
you should just get a red crumpled paper and turn that in as your project

Steph DudakSaturday, November 5, 2011 at 12:03am EDT
XD

Steph DudakSaturday, November 5, 2011 at 12:03am EDT
great idea

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 5, 2011 at 12:10am EDT
i thought so

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 5, 2011 at 12:17am EDT
so i now understand how you want to general outline to be, now you want the heart delicate, the arm rough, and how are you making the background?

Steph DudakSaturday, November 5, 2011 at 12:28am EDT
dunno yet

Steph DudakSaturday, November 5, 2011 at 12:28am EDT
it's gonna be some ridiculous thing though

Steph DudakSaturday, November 5, 2011 at 12:32am EDT
all crazy lookin and such

Steph DudakSaturday, November 5, 2011 at 12:32am EDT
like a maze

Steph DudakSaturday, November 5, 2011 at 12:32am EDT
but not really

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 5, 2011 at 12:34am EDT
lots of lines

Steph DudakSaturday, November 5, 2011 at 12:37am EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, November 5, 2011 at 12:54am EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, November 5, 2011 at 12:55am EDT

mornight!

Steph DudakSaturday, November 5, 2011 at 3:54pm EDT
you're not here again BUT. http://i44.tinypic.com/15ziko9.png this was the other art project idea. the second half i think would look better the way it's going. like have that shape a face instead of having random ones all over. anyway it's just a quick thing, and it's not really proportional. but even the final one if and when i do it, the features will be exaggerated purposely since i can't draw people normally. AND YOU SEE THE ONE LITTLE DROPLET COLORED: http://i42.tinypic.com/16kdi7s.png FUCK YES I AM SO EXCITED AND HAPPY.

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 1:06am EST
yes

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 1:06am EST
this is awesome

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 1:06am EST
the only problem

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 1:06am EST
is that you spelled coloured wrong :P

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 10:19am EST
Yaaay thanks lol & oh wah. I redrew this horizontally. Well I drew the eyes. This is proving to be a pain in the ass. I'll make it work somehow

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 12:17pm EST
well at least you know its a good idea now

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 12:18pm EST
otherwise you wouldn't have gone through the trouble of making it more awesome

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 12:53pm EST
This is true. I still have so much stuff to do lol wtf

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 12:53pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:46pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:47pm EST
and if she doesnt ill be sad

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:47pm EST
cause we've made plans for her to come down here like twice already over the summer before this but she wasn't able to

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:47pm EST
and slit your wrists and hang yourself?

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:47pm EST
and i haven't seen her in two years

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:47pm EST
YES

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:47pm EST
in an underwater cage

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:47pm EST
its a good thing your so goffik or you'd be dead by now

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:47pm EST
the cage would be filled with water

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:47pm EST
can you drown while trying to hang yourself?

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
doubtful

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
i guess you'd have to inhale a bunch of water at once and then hang yourself

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
you'd need some messed up gravity

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
or have a globe of water on your head

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
yeah

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
hehe

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
YEAH

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
hanging by fishbowl

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
now

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
skdhjkdh

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
well no

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
i kind of want to ......

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
you might get sent to a therapist

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
is that weird

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
do it anyway

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
there's a lot of things like that i wanna draw

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:49pm EST
but

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:49pm EST
no since I already started

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:49pm EST
i can't draw people

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:49pm EST
i wanted to do some sort of thing with someone like ripping out their insides. i'm not too familiar with human anatomy though. i should do an independent study or something.

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:49pm EST
and then learn how to draw all that stuff

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:49pm EST
and then just draw the most wretched weird things you'd ever see

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:49pm EST
i'd probably get sent to a therapist

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:50pm EST
my mother would question my sanity

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:50pm EST
make a 30 day challenge for yourself on tumblr

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:50pm EST
a human pose a day

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:50pm EST
best way I know to get something done

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:50pm EST
mom always asks what i'm drawing. "Hey what are you drawing?" "a girl hanging herself while slitting her wrists with a fish bowl on her head full of water in an attempt to drown herself through all of this."

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:50pm EST
that'd go over well..

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:51pm EST
why wouldn't it?

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:51pm EST
right? who doesn't think of things like that?

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:51pm EST
she asked me yesterday what i was drawing

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:51pm EST
i think i said i don't know

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:51pm EST
cause i didn't feel like explaining it was a person basically made out of her own tears.

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:52pm EST
yeah she might get a bit suspicious at that

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:52pm EST
a little bit

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:52pm EST
WHY ARE YOU DEPRESSED WHY ARE YOU SAD WHY ARE YOU DRAWING *THAT*

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:52pm EST
etc

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:52pm EST
etc

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:53pm EST
oh but imagine if i was drawing that other thing

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:53pm EST
askjhjkfhgf

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:53pm EST
that's why i don't draw downstairs on a desk

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:53pm EST
just say its ironic

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:53pm EST
cause then they ask questions

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:53pm EST
and questions are annoying

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:53pm EST
and i'm like uh yeah. i was not happy so i did this. WHY WERENT YOU HAPPY OMG WUT R U OK

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:53pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:56pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 8:56pm EST

stupid NJIT. i can't pick my better scores. i need to write down like a single test scored

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:16pm EST
score*

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:16pm EST
of course that'll be the last one i took. but that one was also the one i got the lowest score in the math section on

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:16pm EST
which is an important section for your major

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:16pm EST
the most important i think actually

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:16pm EST
oh well

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:16pm EST
more important than being able to correct sentences

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:17pm EST
and read passages

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:17pm EST
no clue why those are so heavily considered

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:17pm EST
i'm good at math though!! ;___; . i just need time sometimes..

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:17pm EST
it makes me mad. i went down in math every time i took that thing

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:17pm EST
i think the first time i got a 600, then a 560, then a 540. or something like that. like wtf.

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:18pm EST
maybe taking pre-calc or whatever you took this year is actually lowering yuor intelligence

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:18pm EST
oh wait

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:18pm EST
lol

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:18pm EST
not that low

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:18pm EST
600, 570, 560

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:18pm EST
but then went up in reading and writing or whatever

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:18pm EST
wtf

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:19pm EST
is it mean that i wished you got a 540

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:19pm EST
so it would decrease in order

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:19pm EST
reading; 530, 520, 600

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:19pm EST
lolol

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:19pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:19pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:19pm EST
and writing. 550, 580, 610

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:19pm EST
well at least those two went up

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:20pm EST
tthe reading by a ton

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:20pm EST
which was weird

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:20pm EST
i'm not complaining

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:20pm EST
but it's not like i did anything between tests

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:20pm EST
idk. so 1810, together. 1770, the last test i took. which isn't fantastic but it doesn't suck

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:21pm EST
completely.

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:21pm EST
not at all

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:21pm EST
when compared to average of people

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:21pm EST
which is depressingly low

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:21pm EST
yeah which is a lot less than that lol

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:21pm EST
and ik people who've gotten less than the average

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:21pm EST
i don't associate myself with people like that

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:21pm EST
jk

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:22pm EST
i know like 10

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:22pm EST
lmao

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:22pm EST
what the best you can get in a section?

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:22pm EST
800?

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:22pm EST
yeah

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:23pm EST
so if you get 800 in all three, you're perfect

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:24pm EST
.02% a year get perfect

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:24pm EST
o.O

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:24pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:25pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:25pm EST

Writing is worse than math it seems. I feel like I could do great on math if I didn't have to rush so much

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:29pm EST
Like you just have to know it

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:29pm EST
well i don't have math this year

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:29pm EST
I left quite a few blank I think

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:30pm EST
Like at the math league thing I couldn't even begin to guess how to answer

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:30pm EST
usually i'm fine

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:30pm EST
but this year i was like .... fffff

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:31pm EST
Lololol math league

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:31pm EST
Omg

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:31pm EST
I couldn't even like

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:31pm EST
I think I was able to actually answer one

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:31pm EST
Maybe two

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:31pm EST
Maybe

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:32pm EST
i understand 4or 5

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:32pm EST
i answer 3-4

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:32pm EST
i get 2-3 correct

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:32pm EST
Gotta stay after for that again in Tuesday.

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:32pm EST
this year

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:32pm EST
i understood like 1

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:32pm EST
yeah this tuesday

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:32pm EST
One of the last ones

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:32pm EST
My answer actually made sense.

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:33pm EST
I never learned permutations

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:33pm EST
Not that that's exactly relevant. But just felt like sharing. Fen went over it for literally five minutes

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:34pm EST
yeahh

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:34pm EST
5!

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:34pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:34pm EST
Yeah

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:34pm EST
I understood those fine

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
Idek where that button is on my calculator

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
i never used the butotn on the calculator

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
Just kidding

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
i usually typed it out

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
I know where it is

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
easier to comprehend

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:36pm EST
I think i understand why i didn't do well in writing

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:36pm EST
I am taking a practice test now

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:36pm EST
fuckin colons

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:39pm EST
Correcting the sentence stuff is fun

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:39pm EST
i think so, I hate when i make stupid errors though

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:44pm EST
Yeah generally that kinda sucks

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:45pm EST
Kinda like when you misplace the only pencil you have wtf

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:45pm EST
which is why i stockpile pencils that i steal from desks that people leave

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
It should be on my bed though

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
Then again my bed is a mess

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
monsters

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:46pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:46pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:47pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:47pm EST
Wait * rather

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:47pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:47pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:48pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:48pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:48pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:48pm EST
mystery solved

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:49pm EST
How'd you manage to do that

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:49pm EST
add an extra 0

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:49pm EST
when your defining the radius

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:50pm EST
of a sphere

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:50pm EST
tends to overload things a bit

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:51pm EST
x.x

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:51pm EST
Do you have a hole puncher?

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:51pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:52pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:52pm EST
Like something you could bring to school and let me use during lunch to put holes in some of my world affairs notes

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:52pm EST
yep

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:53pm EST
Yaaaay! I have a test Tuesday and I greatly underestimated the information I have to know

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:54pm EST
Looks like I'll be cramming massively tomorrow night

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:54pm EST
I better not get any actual homework that'll take me a million years to do

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:54pm EST
...art. And architecture. Well.

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:54pm EST
Shit.

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:55pm EST
i feel like one day i wll regret not having taken a schedule like yours

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:55pm EST
not today though

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:56pm EST
Definitely not today

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:57pm EST
Because today I want to cry in a corner. Time to make myself a schedule

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:57pm EST
Okay

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:57pm EST
Let's see.

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 9:58pm EST
looking

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 10:01pm EST
I can stay up for another hour. I gotta work on my art project. I only have one and I need two by Wednesday. Tomorrow I will go to school. During art I will work on my project. During architecture I will work on my plans. Hopefully getting the front elevation finished and get started on the side. Blahblahblah. During lunch. Eat. And work on my art project. Or go over my physics hw. I didn't answer one so I might have to make Kevin help me. Then imma go home. I'm going to not put on pjs bc then I'll be comfortable and want to sleep. I'll do any actual hw I have first. Then I'll study some physics and do some problems and somehow memorize my derivations. Then I'll study for world affairs. Then I'll have to eat dinner. Then I'll immediately come home. Work on art for a little bit. Study for physics, then study for world affairs. Lots of world affairs studying.

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 10:02pm EST
Tuesday. I'll take both those awful tests. Depending where I'm at in architecture, I might bring home that stuff and finish it. Everything's due Wednesday. Probably do the same thing during lunch Tuesday. Then I gotta stay after for math league. Go home. Eat. Study for pre calc, do actual homework, spend all night doing art projects and maybe architecture stuff

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 10:03pm EST
End up getting no sleep, take a test Wednesday morning, be brain dead for the rest of the day, go home and look forward to the weekend while looking back on the last three days wanting to cry because I handled it poorly

Steph DudakSunday, November 6, 2011 at 10:03pm EST
Sounds good.

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 10:04pm EST

The Brazilian government used Agent Orange to defoliate a large section of the Amazon rainforest so that Alcoa could build the Tucuruí dam to power mining operations.

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 10:20pm EST
those fucking bastards

Nick DevlinSunday, November 6, 2011 at 10:21pm EST
"The site, a former waste oil recycling storage facility, accepted waste oil from a number of companies, including Alcoa. The facility was improperly managed and operated and, as a result, soils on the York Oil Property and nearby wetlands sediments and groundwater were contaminated. "

Introduction

Steph DudakMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:23pm EST
Write the actual body of it then

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:23pm EST
the intro explains the article

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:24pm EST
this paper has a weird format

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:24pm EST
explain article, then critisize the article, then explain the them used for book and article

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:24pm EST
then explain book

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:24pm EST
I don't know why i am finding this so difficult

Steph DudakMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:27pm EST
Idk why either o.o

Steph DudakMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:28pm EST
It's basically just a paper on the book. Almost like an analysis but not so in depth going from what you just said

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:28pm EST
pretty much

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:28pm EST
we just compare a theme in a book and an article

Steph DudakMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:30pm EST
Nick

Steph DudakMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:30pm EST
It's so easy

Steph DudakMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:30pm EST
You don't even need to think

Steph DudakMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:30pm EST
Are you thinking? Maybe that's the problem

Steph DudakMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:30pm EST
Stop thinking. Write. Reread what you wrote and go from there.

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:31pm EST
i am always thinking

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:31pm EST
just of the wrong things

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:31pm EST

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:40pm EST
worst way to learn

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:40pm EST

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:40pm EST
but not a good way at all

Steph DudakMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:42pm EST

Declared 2012 Republican Presidential Candidate Jimmy McMillan The former mayoral, gubernatorial and senatorial candidate for the Rent Is Too Damn High Party announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination on December last year. Explaining his decision not to contest the Democratic nomination, a party he was formerly registered with, karate expert McMillan was quoted as saying "the rent is too damn high." The flamboyant Vietnam veteran also gave some words of advice to President Obama, “If you don’t do your job right, I am coming at you!"

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:53pm EST
it is meant to be read as

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:53pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:55pm EST
sounds about right

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:59pm EST
Since I've gotten home i've partially written my essay, found an article that actually relates to my topic, rewritten my essay partially to match new article, done work cited, and remembered that i have to rewrite abstract

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:59pm EST
only took hours

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 5:59pm EST
3

Steph DudakMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:00pm EST
.-.

Steph DudakMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:00pm EST
what if you were timed to do this

Steph DudakMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:01pm EST
like what if you only had an hour to do this or you'd die

Steph DudakMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:01pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:01pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:01pm EST
and edited

Steph DudakMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:01pm EST

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:07pm EST
hmmm

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:07pm EST
if it had to be perfect i might not make it

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:08pm EST

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:08pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:36pm EST
Cannot

Steph DudakMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:36pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:37pm EST
Words dumb

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:38pm EST

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:38pm EST
"words dumb, me like smash"

Steph DudakMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:40pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:41pm EST
Good one

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:42pm EST

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:42pm EST
Article Summary It is common for companies to cut corners concerning safety and environmental when behind on schedule, but the company BP (British Petroleum) had major issues in the Spring of 2010. The Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded due to numerous problems involving the instruments used, and environmental factors such as weather and currents. The Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations scrutinized the spill in order to determine if BP was at fault for the explosion. The investigations showed that despite multiple warnings from personnel regarding the safety issues of their plans, decisions were still made to use unsafe procedures. This led to many ignored malfunctions that eventually led up to the explosion “killing 11 crew and releasing an estimated 210,000 gallons of oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico” (Saxe). blablabla more stuff about article Critique (of Article) The article gives good details and explanation but is somewhat difficult to understand due to the jargon used along with boring format. It cannot be thoroughly understood prior knowledge of business and oil rig machinery.

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:44pm EST
my critique will be expanded upon but i just want to show how little i can get done in 3

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:44pm EST
4 hours

Steph DudakMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:48pm EST
It cannot be thoroughly understood without* prior knowledge of business and oil rig machinery. Is that what you meant? Or an I just not reading it right

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:50pm EST
no you're correct

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:50pm EST
thank you

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:51pm EST
I know its gotten bad that I consider reading the article my research paper is written about as wasting time

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:51pm EST
that-->when

Steph DudakMonday, November 7, 2011 at 6:52pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, November 7, 2011 at 8:02pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, November 7, 2011 at 8:02pm EST
Tears wtf

Steph DudakMonday, November 7, 2011 at 8:02pm EST

Nick DevlinMonday, November 7, 2011 at 8:07pm EST

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 7:35pm EST
it wasn't

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 7:35pm EST
Unicorn Unicorn hair generally produces the most consistent magic, and is least subject to fluctuations and blockages. Wands with unicorn cores are generally the most difficult to turn to the Dark Arts. They are the most faithful of all wands, and usually remain strongly attached to their first owner, irrespective of whether he or she was an accomplished witch or wizard. Minor disadvantages of unicorn hair are that they do not make the most powerful wands (although the wand wood may compensate) and that they are prone to melancholy if seriously mishandled, meaning that the hair may 'die' and need replacing. Dragon As a rule, dragon heartstrings produce wands with the most power, and which are capable of the most flamboyant spells. Dragon wands tend to learn more quickly than other types. While they can change allegiance if won from their original master, they always bond strongly with the current owner. The dragon wand tends to be easiest to turn to the Dark Arts, though it will not incline that way of its own accord. It is also the most prone of the three cores to accidents, being somewhat temperamental. Phoenix This is the rarest core type. Phoenix feathers are capable of the greatest range of magic, though they may take longer than either unicorn or dragon cores to reveal this. They show the most initiative, sometimes acting of their own accord, a quality that many witches and wizards dislike. Phoenix feather wands are always the pickiest when it comes to potential owners, for the creature from which they are taken is one of the most independent and detached in the world. These wands are the hardest to tame and to personalise, and their allegiance is usually hard won.

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 7:35pm EST
there we go

Steph DudakWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 7:37pm EST
oooo

Steph DudakWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 7:37pm EST
well that's pretty cool

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 7:37pm EST
theres entries for type of wood and wand length/flexibility as well

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 7:38pm EST
Cherry This very rare wand wood creates a wand of strange power, most highly prized by the wizarding students of the school of Mahoutokoro in Japan, where those who own cherry wands have special prestige. The Western wand-purchaser should dispel from their minds any notion that the pink blossom of the living tree makes for a frivolous or merely ornamental wand, for cherry wood often makes a wand that possesses truly lethal power, whatever the core, but if teamed with dragon heartstring, the wand ought never to be teamed with a wizard without exceptional self-control and strength of mind.

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 7:38pm EST
she made a description for EVERY type of wood

Steph DudakWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 7:38pm EST
O.O

Where wizards have been buried with wands of yew, the wand generally sprouts into a tree guarding the dead owner’s grave. What is certain, in my experience, is that the yew wand never chooses either a mediocre or a timid owner.

Steph DudakWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:09pm EST
that's pretty cool

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:09pm EST
Where wizards have been buried with wands of yew, the wand generally sprouts into a tree guarding the dead owner’s grave.

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:09pm EST
my favorite part

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:09pm EST
that would be awesome

Steph DudakWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:11pm EST
A sensitive wand, hazel often reflects its owner’s emotional state, and works best for a master who understands and can manage their own feelings.

Steph DudakWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:11pm EST
Others should be very careful handling a hazel wand if its owner has recently lost their temper, or suffered a serious disappointment, because the wand will absorb such energy and discharge it unpredictably.

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:11pm EST
well i lost my emotions a while bac

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:11pm EST
so i'm good

Steph DudakWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:11pm EST
that's good

Steph DudakWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:12pm EST
i definitely wouldn't end up with a wand like that

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:12pm EST
can you sign up for pottermore yet?

Steph DudakWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:12pm EST

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:14pm EST
you find little images in the picture to get info

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:14pm EST
there are little articles that you can click on the side

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:14pm EST
either give excerpts from the book

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:14pm EST
summaries of places or characters

most of it is just copied from the text of the books

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:15pm EST
but there is a lot of new info in some the articles

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:15pm EST
stuff that couldn't be fit into the books

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:15pm EST
like the backstory of petunia and vernon

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:15pm EST
how they got married and everything

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:16pm EST
you just keep going through more and more pictures and look for very obvious little objects in the images to click on

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:16pm EST
occasionally you have to take a quiz or something

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:16pm EST
and it will tell you your wand type

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:16pm EST
and sort you into a house

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:16pm EST
so like at chapter 4 or 5 or whatever when harry gets his wand

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:17pm EST

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:17pm EST
you click to get images of school supplies

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:17pm EST
and to get the wand

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:17pm EST
you take a quiz

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:17pm EST
thats pretty simplified i suppose

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:17pm EST
but easiest way i can explain

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:22pm EST
New things like this

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 8:22pm EST
Of the three approved animals permitted to students as pets at Hogwarts, the toad is, and has been for many years now, by far the least popular. Centuries ago, in blood-thirstier times, when young witches and wizards were expected to personally pop out the newt eyes they were using in potions, they routinely brought boxes of toads to school for use in potions and in other charms. Over time, as the Ministry of Magic introduced legislation regarding animal cruelty (sub-sections 13-29 inclusive relate to potion ingredients and their production) such practices were gradually outlawed. The toad, never much appreciated for its own personal appeal, gradually appeared (alive) less and less frequently at Hogwarts, unless hopping and swimming wild in the grounds. By the time Harry arrived at Hogwarts, possession of a pet toad conveyed neither cool nor status; indeed, it was something of an embarrassment. Trevor, Neville's toad, had nothing to commend him except a propensity for getting lost, and when he finally slipped off to join his brethren in the Hogwarts lake, both owner and pet felt a sense of relief.

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 9:06pm EST
now i get to read some letter

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 9:06pm EST
Congratulations! I’m Prefect Gemma Farley, and I’m delighted to welcome you to SLYTHERIN HOUSE. Our emblem is the serpent, the wisest of creatures; our house colours are emerald green and silver, and our common room lies behind a concealed entrance down in the dungeons. As you’ll see, its windows look out into the depths of the Hogwarts lake. We often see the giant squid swooshing by – and sometimes more interesting creatures. We like to feel that our hangout has the aura of a mysterious, underwater shipwreck. Now, there are a few things you should know about Slytherin – and a few you should forget. Firstly, let’s dispel a few myths. You might have heard rumours about Slytherin house – that we’re all into the Dark Arts, and will only talk to you if your great-grandfather was a famous wizard, and rubbish like that. Well, you don’t want to believe everything you hear from competing houses. I’m not denying that we’ve produced our share of Dark wizards, but so have the other three houses – they just don’t like admitting it. And yes, we have traditionally tended to take students who come from long lines of witches and wizards, but nowadays you’ll find plenty of people in Slytherin house who have at least one Muggle parent. Here’s a little-known fact that the other three houses don’t bring up much: Merlin was a Slytherin. Yes, Merlin himself, the most famous wizard in history! He learned all he knew in this very house! Do you want to follow in the footsteps of Merlin? Or would you rather sit at the old desk of that illustrious ex-Hufflepuff, Eglantine Puffett, inventor of the Self-Soaping Dishcloth? I didn’t think so. But that’s enough about what we’re not. Let’s talk about what we are, which is the coolest and edgiest house in this school. We play to win, because we care about the honour and traditions of Slytherin. We also get respect from our fellow students. Yes, some of that respect might be tinged with fear, because of our Dark reputation, but you know what? It can be fun, having a reputation for walking on the wild side. Chuck out a few hints that you’ve got access to a whole library of curses, and see whether anyone feels like nicking your pencil case. But we’re not bad people. We’re like our emblem, the snake: sleek, powerful, and frequently misunderstood. For instance, we Slytherins look after our own – which is more than you can say for Ravenclaw. Apart from being the biggest bunch of swots you ever met, Ravenclaws are famous for clambering over each other to get good marks, whereas we Slytherins are brothers. The corridors of Hogwarts can throw up surprises for the unwary, and you’ll be glad you’ve got the Serpents on your side as you move around the school. As far as we’re concerned, once you’ve become a snake, you’re one of ours – one of the elite. Because you know what Salazar Slytherin looked for in his chosen students? The seeds of greatness. You’ve been chosen by this house because you’ve got the potential to be great, in the true sense of the word. All right, you might see a couple of people hanging around the common room whom you might not think are destined for anything special. Well, keep that to yourself. If the Sorting Hat put them in here, there’s something great about them, and don’t you forget it. And talking of people who aren’t destined for greatness, I haven’t mentioned the Gryffindors. Now, a lot of people say that Slytherins and Gryffindors represent two sides of the same coin. Personally, I think Gryffindors are nothing more than wannabe Slytherins. Mind you, some people say that Salazar Slytherin and Godric Gryffindor prized the same kinds of students, so perhaps we are more similar than we like to think. But that doesn’t mean that we cosy up with Gryffindors. They like beating us only slightly less than we like beating them. A few more things you might need to know: our house ghost is the Bloody Baron. If you get on the right side of him he’ll sometimes agree to frighten people for you. Just don’t ask him how he got bloodstained; he doesn’t like it. The password to the common room changes every fortnight. Keep an eye on the noticeboard. Never bring anyone from another house into our common room or tell them our password. No outsider has entered it for more than seven centuries. Well, I think that’s all for now. I’m sure you’ll like our dormitories. We sleep in ancient four-posters with green silk hangings, and bedspreads embroidered with silver thread. Medieval tapestries depicting the adventures of famous Slytherins cover the walls, and silver lanterns hang from the ceilings. You’ll sleep well; it’s very soothing, listening to the lake water lapping against the windows at night.

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 9:10pm EST
all that is good that came out of this is that green is my favorite colour

Steph DudakWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 9:10pm EST

Steph DudakWednesday, November 9, 2011 at 9:12pm EST
Do you want to follow in the footsteps of Merlin? Or would you rather sit at the old desk of that illustrious ex-Hufflepuff, Eglantine Puffett, inventor of the Self-Soaping Dishcloth? hahaha

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:19pm EST
and my brain hates me today

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:19pm EST
a fictional story

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:20pm EST
no requirements besides <5

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:20pm EST
pages

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:21pm EST
o

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:21pm EST
so you can literally write about anything

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:21pm EST
yep

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:21pm EST
well

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:21pm EST
hell icould write a poem if i wanted

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:21pm EST
um

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:21pm EST
what do you want to write about? you dont know that do you

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:22pm EST
nope

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:22pm EST
i'm thinking it will be fantasy related somehow

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:22pm EST
since that is my favorite genre

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:22pm EST
but fantasy isn't a very good tpe for short stories

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:23pm EST
make up some sort of weird creature

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:24pm EST
that lives somewhere in the sky

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:24pm EST
on like an island or something. not just floating up there

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:24pm EST
a floating island?

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:24pm EST
sure

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:24pm EST
well you said in the sjy

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:24pm EST
sky*

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:25pm EST
yes so it would be implied that the island is floating

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:26pm EST
hmm

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:27pm EST
i'm thinking the creature should already exist in some story

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:27pm EST
but either be obscure enough for me to set my own rules for it

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:27pm EST
or have its rules be rewritten by be to be seen in a different way

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:28pm EST
because inventing a magical creature would take a very long time

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:28pm EST
time to pull out the encyclopias gathering dust on my shelves

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:31pm EST
not difficult. just combine existing animals. like in avatar

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:31pm EST
the story doesn't need to be about it really

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:31pm EST
but it can be included

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:32pm EST
well if I invent my own creature I will become too focuses on the animal and not the story about it

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:33pm EST
I just need a base to work aroun

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:33pm EST
d

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:33pm EST
and I kind of want the story to be based around the creature

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:33pm EST
not as like a character

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:33pm EST
major just as a plot point

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:33pm EST
like finding it or helping it

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:33pm EST
have someone go searching for the creature?

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:33pm EST
because

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:34pm EST
the person's looking for something else

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:34pm EST
but needs the creatures help to find it

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:34pm EST
idk

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:34pm EST
hmm

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:35pm EST
you know how in avatar, aang well. he accidentally finds that lion turtle thing? cause it looks like an island. and he helps him figure out how to defeat the fire lord without actually killing him

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:35pm EST
some sort of wise awesome creature

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:35pm EST
that's important and overlooked by most people

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:36pm EST
that might work

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:36pm EST
I could probably define everything better if I picked a more specific genre

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:36pm EST
should the style be more mythic

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:36pm EST
or urban fantasy

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:37pm EST
or high fantasy

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:37pm EST
sci fi

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:38pm EST
not high fantasy, too long

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:38pm EST
sci fi I'm not smart enough to write

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:43pm EST
Okay so i want a main character that need to find a magical beast in order to accomplish a goal

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:44pm EST
they need to find the creature

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:44pm EST
to gain knowledge or information of some kind

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:50pm EST
thanks for help Steph! talkto ya lter

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 12:50pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 9:45pm EST
mhmm

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 9:45pm EST
but i didn't even use my notes or anything except for the last question

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 9:45pm EST
and everything was fine. like. i don't understand why i did so bad on it in class. it's the same exact test.

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
so you're really annoyed that you got it all this time but not when you first took it?

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
yes.

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
exactly

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
now you are making sense

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
well i am making sense for you

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
close enough

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
furious really. because i could've gotten a really good grade on it.

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
and yes that is annoying as funk

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
with corrections i'll bring it up to like a C

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
but

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
jesus christ

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 9:53pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 9:53pm EST
yes

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 9:53pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 9:53pm EST
BUT NO

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 9:53pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 10:36pm EST
maybe

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 10:36pm EST
but i also dunno if that IS my concentration SO therein lies the issue

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 10:36pm EST
well it doesn't matter that much anyway, you should probly draw things you really like every once in a while even if they don realate to your concentration

Nick DevlinThursday, November 10, 2011 at 10:37pm EST
otherwise you will hate art as much as i hate programming

Steph DudakThursday, November 10, 2011 at 10:37pm EST

and here you are

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 7:31pm EST
with a literal scene

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 7:31pm EST
as opposed to aesthetic genius

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 7:31pm EST
-shakes head-

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 7:33pm EST
there was like one other guy who made an awesome tree thing

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 7:33pm EST

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 7:34pm EST

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 7:35pm EST
that logic kinda makes little sense

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 7:35pm EST

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 7:54pm EST
hopefully a day of rest will not utterly destroy your school work

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 7:55pm EST
oh it will

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 7:55pm EST
i regret nothing

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
good

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
regret is a terrible feeling to have

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
i'm sure

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
i wouldn't know though

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
never felt it?

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 7:57pm EST
nope

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 7:57pm EST
i regret nothing usually applies to my entire life

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 7:57pm EST
that's good

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 7:57pm EST
I've felt it on occasion

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 7:57pm EST
its not fun

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 7:58pm EST
especialy when you know you could still change what you regret doing or not doing

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 7:58pm EST
but you still ignore the problem

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:00pm EST
because i don't want to feel actual feelings of regret i choose not to do it, i think. because that doesn't mix well with the other emotional issues i have. so it's more so going through life with a shit happens attitude. never expecting too much, and realizing that especially if it's in the past, my decisions probably seemed right at the time

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:01pm EST
the rest of my being isn't so selective though

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:02pm EST
yeah, that way of thinking applies to some of my emotions for different reasons, like anger and joy are two big ones I never really use.

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:03pm EST
which are kind of important but meh

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:03pm EST
i can't apply it to any other emotions i have

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:03pm EST
i also can't pretend to be happy when i'm not

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:04pm EST
i kinda wish i could cause then i wouldn't need to worry about people being like wah whats wrong D:<< all the time

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:04pm EST
i can't fake emotions, but i can hide them with a shield of apathetic sarcasm

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:04pm EST
haha

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:04pm EST
look at the answer to this sat question

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:04pm EST
In the final sentence of Passage 2 ("I thought... in me"), the author expresses (A) exultation (B) vindication (C) pleasure (D) regret (E) guilt

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:04pm EST
Guess the correct answer

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:05pm EST

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:22pm EST
hahaha

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:22pm EST
glad to know you think so much like a pony

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:22pm EST
found a response

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:23pm EST
yes

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:23pm EST
exactly

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:26pm EST
i'm so screwed on the math section

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:26pm EST
like you have no idea

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:26pm EST
I can't even remember how people thought I was good at math

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:26pm EST
Here just as proof of my stupidity

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:26pm EST
The projected sales volume of a video game cartridge is given by the function where is the number of cartridges sold, in thousands; is the price per cartridge, in dollars; and is a constant. If according to the projections, cartridges are sold at per cartridge, how many cartridges will be sold at per cartridge?

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:27pm EST
the equation is http://sat.collegeboard.org/mathmlgen/content/question/practiceQuestion/multipleChoice/mathMCq3_1.png

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:27pm EST
my equation that i wrote after filling in the info

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:28pm EST
100,000(10)=3000/2(10)+a

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:29pm EST
is that not right

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:31pm EST
s(p)

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:31pm EST
only means y

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:31pm EST
so i don't put 10 in the parenthesis

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:31pm EST
i'm not really paying attention to the problem

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:31pm EST
oh yeah

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:31pm EST
i know that lol

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:32pm EST
its also given in thouasands so the number is 100 not 100,000

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:32pm EST
this is like 8th grade

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:32pm EST
it took me 10 minutes

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:32pm EST
x.x

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:33pm EST

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:34pm EST

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:35pm EST
no not 3rd period

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:35pm EST
idk

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:35pm EST
you should ask her

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:36pm EST
do you think she''l actually let me do it?

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:36pm EST
i've never even spoken to her

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:36pm EST
you can try lol. if you don't have any important classes anyway

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:36pm EST
don't you have a study hall?

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:37pm EST
2nd

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:37pm EST
right now in pre calc we're doing graphic inequalities though

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:38pm EST
boring

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:38pm EST
hate those

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:38pm EST
well

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:38pm EST
i lost my train of thought

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:38pm EST
um

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:38pm EST
yeah i dont even know

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:38pm EST
it's not awful though

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:40pm EST
i just need to remember stuff like

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:40pm EST
the square root of x can be rewritten as x to the power of -1/2

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:40pm EST
so i am able to solve equations

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:41pm EST
you can just like go in an ask her questions i guess. she's in there before school starts

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:41pm EST
i have a pass lol

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:41pm EST
its laminated

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:42pm EST
you must feel special

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:42pm EST
i guess i just need like a tutor

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:42pm EST
but i feel like all i'll be doing is asking stupid questions with answers I could easily look up on google

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:43pm EST
like how to solve equations when absolute value is involved

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:43pm EST
likee?

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:43pm EST
ninja'd

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:43pm EST
...

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:43pm EST
|x+3| = 6 equations like those

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:44pm EST
or |x+3|>6

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:44pm EST
|4x-7|=5 is the one i am on right now

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:44pm EST
equalities not inequalities

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:44pm EST
i remember some about flipping the sign for inequalities though

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:44pm EST
when you multiple by a negative

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:45pm EST
i think

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:45pm EST
idk

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:45pm EST
irrelevant though

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:46pm EST
Divide

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
dammit that was simple as hell

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
multiple other side by -1

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:48pm EST
completely forgot

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:55pm EST
Poor Nicholas

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:55pm EST
Should've taken a math this year

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:57pm EST
well i actually enjoy most of my classes

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 8:57pm EST
i think it was worth it

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 9:00pm EST
Let the function f be defined by (some long as equation) and (some other long ass equation), what is one possible value of t?

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 9:00pm EST
I had no clue how to solve

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 9:00pm EST
so i put 1 in the checkbox soit would help me know how to solve

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 9:00pm EST
i was correct

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 9:00pm EST
Lmao

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 9:00pm EST
by guessing 1 in the fill-ins, why doesn't this work on the real SAT's

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 9:01pm EST
Bc actual SATs suck

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 9:02pm EST
agreed

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 9:03pm EST
Yk what's funny?

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 9:04pm EST
I was sick the last time I took my SATs and thats the one I did best on

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 9:05pm EST
cuz you need to be out of you mind when you take them

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 9:05pm EST
sickness makes brain all messed up

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 9:06pm EST
so obviously that why i did so well last time

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 9:06pm EST
because although i rarely leave my house

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 9:06pm EST
i always stay out late with my brain

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 9:10pm EST
Sounds about right

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 9:12pm EST
judging by the prep test

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 9:13pm EST
every answer i give will be 1

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 9:13pm EST
i've guessed one about 4 times

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 9:13pm EST
and its always been right

Steph DudakFriday, November 11, 2011 at 9:16pm EST
Sounds like a perfect strategy

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 9:19pm EST
better than guessing c

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 9:19pm EST
which is my strategy on reading and writing

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 9:22pm EST
yeah i'm done with sat testing today

Nick DevlinFriday, November 11, 2011 at 9:22pm EST
i've have well and fully established that I am not gonna do well

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 8:47pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 8:48pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 8:54pm EST
Idek and idec

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 8:55pm EST
i thought that was the thing the chart was about

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 8:55pm EST
but i'm getting more of a vibe that its sayin i dont even know

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 8:55pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:01pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:01pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:01pm EST
look at me knowing my initialisms

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:05pm EST
Check you out

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:06pm EST
Do you think my art concentration could be like. Conveying emotions of a piece through the color and patterns used? I feel like that's what a lot of art generally is.. But I mean if my stuffs gonna be all design bases

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:06pm EST
Based*

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:06pm EST
hmm

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:07pm EST
Honestly I just don't know how to fit the things I wanna do into a concentration

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:12pm EST
yeah thats the best way I can think of to state a theme in which you could draw wahtever

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:22pm EST
Meeeeeh.

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:22pm EST
I should ask mrs. Calicchio shouldn't I

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:22pm EST
i feel like she might not accept that theme so yeah

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:23pm EST
I feel like if I wanted that as a basis she could help me shape it

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:23pm EST
But like. The pieces would reflect emotions themselves

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:24pm EST
Like I wouldn't be able to draw WHATEVER I wanted

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:24pm EST
sadness anger etc

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:24pm EST
I couldn't draw a castle

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:24pm EST
need an overall emotion for each

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:24pm EST
I was also trying to think of how to do one depictingjealousy

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:24pm EST
I just know itd be green

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:25pm EST
that's a difficult one

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:25pm EST
I'd love to figure out a way to do it without using people

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:26pm EST
I just thought of someone's shoulder with a little green monster thing sitting on it

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:26pm EST
Making the person green

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:27pm EST
thats first thing i thought of

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:27pm EST
but i dont know

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:27pm EST
seems generic

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:27pm EST
So the person would have to fade from grey to green

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:27pm EST
Yeah

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:27pm EST
But patterns and such

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:27pm EST
So so far that would be three things that use an actual person in it

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:27pm EST
I have a face An arm with a hand A shoulder Wtf

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:28pm EST
Idk how I'd make jealousy works

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:28pm EST
Without being generic and cheesy

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:29pm EST
hmm jealous is kind of an icky emotion

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:29pm EST
so with the green colout i'd say make everything kind of slimy looking

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:30pm EST
almost melting

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:30pm EST
no clue how you'd draw that texture

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:32pm EST
So like. Basically everything would be made out of alone

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:32pm EST
Wow

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:32pm EST
Really. Autocorrecting slime

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:32pm EST
As if it isn't a word

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:32pm EST
slime-->alone?

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:33pm EST
I can't even

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:33pm EST
So like

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:34pm EST
Idk how else to portray jealousy without using a person. But what I can see is this slimy little green thing on someones shoulder

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:34pm EST
Like an oozling

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:34pm EST
yes, like an oozling

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:34pm EST
and the slime could be infecting him

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
like where it touches him the person is turn grreen

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
Yk what I mean when I say that right. And like. It can be almost. Covering the person in slime. But you

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
Yeah

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
maybe it should be a monster

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
as much as like an infection disgusting blob

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:45pm EST
Well it can be a disgusting slimy monster

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
Like a green muk lol

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:46pm EST
yes

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:47pm EST
What if

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:47pm EST
It were multiple.

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:47pm EST
elaborate

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:47pm EST
Like a muk like thing and little oozlings

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:47pm EST
Kinda like

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:47pm EST
Embedding themselves

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:47pm EST
Into the person

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:47pm EST
a muk thing is behing the person

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:48pm EST
latching on little oozling

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:48pm EST
s

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:48pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:58pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 9:58pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 10:05pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 10:06pm EST
You should during lunch. You don't make a lot of sense online sometimes lol

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 10:07pm EST
sometimes?

Steph DudakSunday, November 13, 2011 at 10:07pm EST
Well most of the time I can eventually decipher what you actually mean

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 10:09pm EST
that doesn't mean i make sense

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 10:09pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 13, 2011 at 10:15pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, November 14, 2011 at 10:00pm EST
Nope lol. But at least your interrupts aren't blatant disregard for and ignoring everything I say.

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 2:49pm EST
>.<

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 2:49pm EST
guess there's no goin back now then

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 2:49pm EST
no

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 2:49pm EST
I really wouldn't be annoyed

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 2:49pm EST
but i'm getting back into this thing of losing/ forgetting everything

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 2:59pm EST
i'm sorry to hear that

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 2:59pm EST
did you write it down?

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 2:59pm EST
many many times

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 2:59pm EST
planner and calander

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 2:59pm EST
but oh well

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 2:59pm EST
its only the 3rd time i've forgotten

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 2:59pm EST
out of 3

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 2:59pm EST
so its fine

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:02pm EST

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:02pm EST
i'll just watch youtube and pretend i'm there

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:04pm EST
in case you were wondering

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:04pm EST
NICK???????????????????????? wat r u doing on fb???????????????????????????????

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:04pm EST
is why i dislike my sister

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:04pm EST
oh siblings

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:04pm EST
they're fantastic

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:05pm EST
oh well i guess she's done talking now

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:05pm EST
oo.....i got to go do my hw... do ur hw brother......i c u later..........

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:05pm EST
i wonder sometimes if she speaks english

isn't that cool?

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:08pm EST
yep

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:08pm EST
kinda looks like tree branches

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:09pm EST
looks mroe like roots to me

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:09pm EST
which pretty much look like tree branches

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:12pm EST
i wish i could obtain a human heart and i mean that in the most non creepy, sane way possible

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:12pm EST

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:25pm EST
Also awesome haha

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:25pm EST
well, I already reblogged the heart thing :P

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:28pm EST
I'm just saying! I mean recently lol like within the last hour

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:29pm EST
suuuree

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:30pm EST
Tais toi Nicholas

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:30pm EST
non

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:34pm EST
I wish it were an hour ago so I could take a nap and wake up soon

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:34pm EST
i wish it were two hours ago and i could remember to go to academic challenge

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:36pm EST
That'd be cool

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:36pm EST
i really need to get on that whole time travel thing

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:37pm EST
That'd be fun. And totally dangerous at the same time

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:37pm EST
Ah time travel

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:38pm EST
depends on how time travel works in our universe

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:38pm EST
i understood

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:39pm EST
I feel like you'd need to be really careful. Like if you really sit there and think about it, the TINIEST things can completely alter your life and other things

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:39pm EST
I mean certain things wouldn't be a big deal. But others

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:39pm EST
well it goes back to which way time travel works

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:39pm EST
if there is only one timeline

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:40pm EST
then yes very very dangerous

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:40pm EST
but if mulitple timelines are created

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:40pm EST
then its not as bad

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:40pm EST
especially if you can travel between them

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:40pm EST
also how far back you go is relevant

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:42pm EST
Yeah that's true. Imagine that though. No imagine if time travel were possible and open to everybody

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:42pm EST
Imagine how the world would be oh my god

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:42pm EST
that would cause unfun things

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:44pm EST
Lets say for arguments sake you go back in time and if you alter something, everything else gets changed. There'd be lots of careless people. And bringing new technology into an older time period. And. All sorts of things. That'd be so crazy

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:44pm EST
lets asume its a multitimeline situation

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:44pm EST
otherwise there would be so many paradoxes my brain would exploud

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:45pm EST
and assuming a timeline is static would be equally irrelevant since everything is on a preset course

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:45pm EST
In the multi time line theory

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:45pm EST
every time a decision is made that creates the possibility for a new timeline

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:46pm EST
decisions are any act of chance

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:46pm EST
which means billions of timelines

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:46pm EST
so technically by going into the past

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:47pm EST
you are going into a sperate timeline

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:47pm EST
leaving behind a copy where you decided not to go back in time

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:47pm EST
which could possibly be visited if you had the technology

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:48pm EST
of course if you interacted in any way that might cause another time split

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:48pm EST
the green light says you left

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:48pm EST
but idc i'm having fun

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:48pm EST
so interaction might be dependant on many things

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:48pm EST
Nope still here

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:48pm EST
facebook is a liar

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:49pm EST
Just listening (reading)

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:49pm EST
then i shall finish my jumbled thoughts

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:50pm EST
the annoying thing about that is where all the energy/matter came from to create all the alternate copies

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:50pm EST
which now that i think of it

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:50pm EST
might actually account for dark matter and energy

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:50pm EST
ohh mind blwon

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:50pm EST
if i seriously just theorized the existance of dark matter

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:50pm EST
i want a nobel proze

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:50pm EST
like now

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:50pm EST
Lmao

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:51pm EST
obviously not for literary achievement though, prize*

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:53pm EST
Obviously. That's nuts though. Basically if you time travel, no matter how it works, you're going to have some issues

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:53pm EST
Teleportation though

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:53pm EST
same issues

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:53pm EST
matter occupying the same space

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:53pm EST
well different issue

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:54pm EST
but just as bad

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:54pm EST
Elaborate.

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:54pm EST
well teleportation is basically just going somewhere without going through any space

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:55pm EST
inbetween your destination and your starting point

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:55pm EST
just thinking of a way that is possible is too complex for me to do

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:55pm EST
but imagining that you would survive however the process works

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:56pm EST
you'd be leaving a void in the space you exit

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:56pm EST
and trying to fill space that already contains matter at your arrival

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:56pm EST
normally things are just pushed around

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:57pm EST
dissapearing doesn't pose much of a problem

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:57pm EST
a vacuum is created that is just filled up by surrounding air

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:57pm EST
but reappearing

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:57pm EST
might cause problems

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:58pm EST
like where the matter in the space you are about to fill is going

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:58pm EST
that could be fixed by you appearance creating a minor burst pushing all air out

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:59pm EST
along with anything else in your way

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:59pm EST
but if it wasn't you might fuse with the particles causing serious health problems

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:59pm EST
or even worse

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 3:59pm EST
on the highly off chance that your atoms collide with anything

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:00pm EST
bad things would happen

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:00pm EST
it might cause a reaction that could kill you

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:00pm EST
hell if it reacted the right way it could kill everyone

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:00pm EST
by creating a black hole

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:01pm EST
That's the problem yes. not so much leaving as appearing. When you said imagining you would survive however the process works. It made me think of the fly, when he teleports the chimp or whatever and it dies. Black holes would be an even bigger issue.

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:03pm EST
black holes really might not happen

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:03pm EST
Little things -> big problems

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:03pm EST
like stepping on a bug

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:03pm EST
that might have been that bug that gave hitler malaria

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:03pm EST
saving millions of people

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:03pm EST
but what if one of those people

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:03pm EST
was worse than hitler

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:04pm EST
and would've killed billions

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:04pm EST
so technically you've saved lives

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:05pm EST
Are you comparing Squishing a bug to creating a black hole?

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:05pm EST
both are relevant to the butterfly effect

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:05pm EST
so yes

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:10pm EST
I suppose that makes sense sorta.. Cant black holes grow?

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:11pm EST
not sure

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:11pm EST
black holes are wierd

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:11pm EST
there are singularities

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:11pm EST
kind of like the only things in the universerve that are 1-dimensional

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:11pm EST
so their physics are really confusing

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:12pm EST
its been stated that nothing can escape a black hole

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:12pm EST
not even light

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:12pm EST
because the gravity is so immense

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:12pm EST
but there is research showing that a form of radiation is outputted by the black hole

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:13pm EST
but how would that be able to escape the effects of gravitiy?

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:13pm EST
perhaps some kind of superpowerful radiation

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:13pm EST
i mean the elecrtomagnetism of a fridge magnet

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:13pm EST
Yeah so I'm just saying if they can, depending on how they can, everything could go really downhill from there. Imagine the world getting engulfed in a black hole

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:14pm EST
well it wouldn't really grow per se

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:14pm EST
it would just absorb everything near it

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:14pm EST
but a black hole would destroy the earth

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:15pm EST
probly the solarsystem

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:15pm EST
or at least majorly fuck shit up

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:16pm EST
i mean its pretty doubtful that a black hole would be creted anyway

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:16pm EST
that takes the mass of a sun, much larger than our own to create

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:19pm EST
Not saying it would be, just saying imagine if. Interesting to think about

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:20pm EST
idk if black holes grow

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:20pm EST
Apparently they can grow.

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:20pm EST
maybe more mass absorbed creates larger ones?

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:20pm EST
It's not like

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:20pm EST
They don't just suck up everything in sight

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:22pm EST
After a black hole forms it can grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. And supermassive black holes can be created by absorbing other stars and like.

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:22pm EST
Merging with other black holes

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:22pm EST
I read that somewhere but I haven't done like a study on black holes so I'm not sure of the accuracy

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:23pm EST
But I mean

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:23pm EST
thats what I was thinking

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:23pm EST
Love google and Wikipedia

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:24pm EST
It says the same thing there

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:24pm EST
And also

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:24pm EST
A supermassive black hole is the largest type of black hole in a galaxy, in the order of hundreds of thousands to billions of solar masses. Most, and possibly all galaxies, including the Milky Way,[2] are believed to contain supermassive black holes at their centers.[3][4]

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:24pm EST
hahah I was in the middle of typing that there is a supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:26pm EST
Astronomers are confident that our own Milky Way galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center, 26,000 light-years from the Solar System, in a region called Sagittarius A*[10] because: The star S2 follows an elliptical orbit with a period of 15.2 years and a pericenter (closest distance) of 17 light hours (1.8×1013 m or 120 AU) from the center of the central object.[11] From the motion of star S2, the object's mass can be estimated as 4.1 million solar masses.[12] The radius of the central object must be significantly less than 17 light hours, because otherwise, S2 would either collide with it or be ripped apart by tidal forces. In fact, recent observations[13] indicate that the radius is no more than 6.25 light-hours, about the diameter of Uranus' orbit. Only a black hole is dense enough to contain 4.1 million solar masses in this volume of space.

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:26pm EST
That's really interesting

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:28pm EST
it almost makes me want to have a job involved with astrophysics

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:28pm EST
almost

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:28pm EST
Yeah almost

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:28pm EST
if you can

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:28pm EST
Kk one sec

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:33pm EST
Yep. I was going to say its really weird when you actually start to think about how things happen and how things work and how insignificant we actually are. That's a nice song, I like it.

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:35pm EST
ughh I used to think about these things every night

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:35pm EST
kind of made homewrk and school seem pointless

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:36pm EST
I occasionally get really melancholy thinking about things like that

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:36pm EST
actually

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:36pm EST
our debate next week is whether or not space exploration is worth it

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:36pm EST
in terms of money and profit and reasoning

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:44pm EST
I feel like I can't make sense of the world. Like. I can't make sense of the worth of money and things we find valuable. I understand it, but I can't make sense of it. At one point we're all going to die. That's life. Now how long our planet will be in existence is unknown as well. At some point in time I feel like everything is just going to become worthless and the entire human race will go extinct or something weird like that. Not that I mean that exactly, but that's the only example I can really give. Anyway I feel like it'd be awesome if like. Money wasn't an issue. Like it was just a thing. Do you know what I mean? Obviously that's a weird thing to say I suppose and at the same time makes no sense cause it's improbable and unlikely that such a thing can or would happen. Understandable. So just stating my opinion disregarding everything else like the issues that come with it, think space exploration is worth it. If we have the technology and can do something with it, we should put it to use. The universe is fucking big. To get to the point where we have is insane. What'd be more interesting is a discovery of some sort of life on some sort of other planet. Not necessarily life like ours or a planet like ours.

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:46pm EST
...did you write that?

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:46pm EST
I feel like life in general is strange. And the ideas humans have developed are strange

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:46pm EST
Yes

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:46pm EST
like in your own words?

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:46pm EST
Yes

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:46pm EST
enter it

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:46pm EST
in something

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:46pm EST
a competition for writing or something

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:47pm EST
i mean i'm sort of biased since that idea goes through my mind far too often

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:47pm EST
but much more well spoken than anyway I could ever elaborate upon

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:50pm EST
You are completely correct in your views by the way. Eventually everything will disappear

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:50pm EST
not just humans but all traces of human

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
the earth itself

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
our sun

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
the galaxy

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
Hahaha. Aside from my slight inability to completely say what I'm thinking but you get it right? Sometimes I really have no words to explain these things. But it's always something to think about.

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
Right?

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
I feel like we waste our time here.

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
its justlike so big

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
A lot of our time is wasted.

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
too much to think about without just realizing nothing is worth it

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
i mean even our goals seem meaningless

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:52pm EST
If you think about it on a larger scale, we live really short lives. THEY DO

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:52pm EST
What it is is we spend all this time worrying about school

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:52pm EST
Jobs

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:52pm EST
Money

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:52pm EST
like i should be finding a way to help the human race survive past the death of earth and our galaxy

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:52pm EST
Even when we do things we like

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:53pm EST
I just feel like. We should literally be able to do what we want. I don't mean that as in you know go kill people for fun bc that's you're hobby

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:53pm EST
And I'm not saying go back to old ways

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:54pm EST
But looking at it from a perspective of how people lived before our technology Before our knowledge Before money was an issue

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:54pm EST
Money and things didn't always exist

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:54pm EST
that is just innocence

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:54pm EST
Yeah

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:55pm EST
ignorance is bliss

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:55pm EST
but i would never choose ignorance over kowing

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:55pm EST
Like I said then thinking about it it's all improbable and kind of ridiculous

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:55pm EST
But recognizing it

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:56pm EST
And realizing time is sort of wasted when you only have one life to live, as far as we know

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:56pm EST
Is annoying

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:58pm EST
very

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:58pm EST
which is probly the big reason there is religion

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:58pm EST
still around

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:58pm EST
people have obviously realized these things

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:59pm EST
and is really hard to deal with every day without having some reason to keep going

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:59pm EST
religion gives people a reason

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:59pm EST
Absolutely. You know some people just can't stand the idea of just dying and having that be it.

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:59pm EST
i really don't like that very much either

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 4:59pm EST
just being a statistic

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:00pm EST
that people 3 generations from now won't even care about

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:00pm EST
or even realize existed

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:00pm EST
I mean it in the least apathetic/pessimistic way possible. But there's not like a reason for our existence really. Dying is another thing I can't grasp the concept of

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:00pm EST
Obviously cause in alive

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:00pm EST
I'm *

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:01pm EST
So to think that one day I'm going to stop functioning is weird to think about

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:01pm EST
Is weird. Minus to think about

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:01pm EST
Redundant.

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:04pm EST
think about thinking?

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:04pm EST
metacognition

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:05pm EST
found out that in one of my word rampages

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:06pm EST
looking up dozens of refelxive words that kind of blew my mind when i thought about them to much

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:06pm EST
That's what happens when I don't go back and check what I wrote before sending

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:09pm EST
know those nerdfighter things i tell you are awesome

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:09pm EST
Yep

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:12pm EST
here is an excerpt from a book one of the guys wrote

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:13pm EST
"There will come a time," I said, "when all of us are dead. All of us. There will come a time when there are no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything. There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra, let alone you. Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this"—I gestured encompassingly—"will have been for naught. Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not survive forever. There was time before organisms experienced consciousness, and there will be time after. And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you, I encourage you to ignore it. God knows that's what everyone else does."

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:15pm EST
And what's that book called?

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:15pm EST
the fault in our stars

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:20pm EST
That's interesting

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:20pm EST
I like that little exempt

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:20pm EST
Excerpt really got corrected

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:21pm EST
those two guys really have defined almost my entire outlook on life

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
my responses to most of these things would most likely have been something like mhmmm

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
interesting

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
that's cool

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
i guess

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:26pm EST
lol

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:27pm EST
which is why its so weird to think about how my life would have gone if i hadn't ever heard of them

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:29pm EST
Makes sense to me. Though in this case that's a positive thing. I have watched them before, just never like religiously or anything haha every now and then. But they're interesting Truthfully I can't stand when people answer me with things like that without anything else. I know people that will be like. Cool. Or like lol yeah. Needless to say I don't have very many conversations with those people. Carolyn is growing on me for that. She can actually have a conversation, no matter how odd the topic may be. I give her credit for that.

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:30pm EST
Most people don't actually go along with my rampages though lol very few do

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:31pm EST
And considering I've never been much of a talker anyway. Yeah

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:31pm EST
carolyn's good to talk to when you want to talk

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:31pm EST
but when you don't

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:32pm EST
she doesn't seem to realize

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:32pm EST
i have to say either she's gotten a lot better, or i'm just more tolerant

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:32pm EST
Little bit of both probably

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:33pm EST
i gotta say though, it was a pretty big chance that I ever saw vlogbrothers

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:33pm EST
my cousin

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:34pm EST
from scotland

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:34pm EST
visited for a like a week at my uncle's house, which I was visiting as well

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:34pm EST
and she showed me a video af them, something like 50 jokes in 4 minutes

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:34pm EST
then i watched them when i went home and never stopped

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:35pm EST
if my cousin hadn't hadn't been over

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:35pm EST
or i didn't go to my uncle's house

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:35pm EST
or if he didn't just get a new computer a month before

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:35pm EST
lots would be different

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:35pm EST
i've never talked to that cousin again btw

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:36pm EST
it's weird what turns out important and what is just forgotten

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:36pm EST
like alayna's traumatic moments

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:39pm EST
See!

Steph DudakTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:40pm EST
One little event. Changes your life forever

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 15, 2011 at 5:46pm EST
exactly

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 16, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
Concussions are fun

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 16, 2011 at 9:35pm EST
you should try getting one

Steph DudakWednesday, November 16, 2011 at 9:36pm EST
o.o

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 16, 2011 at 9:36pm EST
hyperbole

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 16, 2011 at 9:36pm EST
mixed with sarcasm

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 16, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
in case you thought any part of that statement was serious

Steph DudakWednesday, November 16, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
i didn't

Steph DudakWednesday, November 16, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
how'd you manage that?

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 16, 2011 at 9:37pm EST
throwing things I probably shouldn't try to throw

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 16, 2011 at 9:38pm EST
specifically 6 foot metal poles

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 16, 2011 at 9:39pm EST
more specifically doing a bottom cone

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 16, 2011 at 9:39pm EST
then throwing the flag straight up, silk down

Steph DudakWednesday, November 16, 2011 at 9:39pm EST
o.O

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 16, 2011 at 9:40pm EST
color guard things make head hurt

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 16, 2011 at 9:40pm EST
^simplified version

Steph DudakWednesday, November 16, 2011 at 9:40pm EST
you should be more careful

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 16, 2011 at 9:40pm EST
yeah i know

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 16, 2011 at 9:42pm EST
but in other news

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 16, 2011 at 9:42pm EST
we're stilll alive

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 16, 2011 at 9:42pm EST
so hopefully no one is messing with teleportation

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 16, 2011 at 9:42pm EST
and things will stay that way

Steph DudakWednesday, November 16, 2011 at 9:43pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, November 17, 2011 at 6:57pm EST
Oh?

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 6:57pm EST
i didn't suck on that practice test

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 6:58pm EST
for SAT

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 6:58pm EST
which is good

Steph DudakThursday, November 17, 2011 at 6:58pm EST
That's lovely

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 6:58pm EST
ikr?

Steph DudakThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:00pm EST
Then ya gotta take the real sat soon oooo

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:01pm EST
yeah i know, maybe they'll just let me have as much time as I need for the real ones as well

Steph DudakThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:03pm EST
You really should time yourself

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:04pm EST
it was timed

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:04pm EST
i went way over

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:04pm EST
for all of them

Steph DudakThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:04pm EST
You should stop when times up instead of going over

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:05pm EST
that would teach me nothing

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:05pm EST
once i understand concepts

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:05pm EST
i will try timing

Steph DudakThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:05pm EST
-.-

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:06pm EST
yeah i just really don't like timed tests

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:07pm EST
and i would only hve like 6 filled in if I actually stopped when the clock ran out -.-

Steph DudakThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:07pm EST
Well the SAT is a timed test so get on that lol

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:08pm EST
D,:

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:15pm EST
!

Steph DudakThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:15pm EST
! ?

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:15pm EST
I totally just found a major called computer graphics design

Steph DudakThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:15pm EST
Where and what's it say about it

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:16pm EST
at rochester

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:16pm EST
This internationally recognized program offers concentrations in interactive design for Web, DVD, and mobile devices; three-dimensional digital graphics; motion graphics; game art and design; and information visualization. The curriculum combines knowledge of design theory, methodology, and aesthetics with skills in two- and three-dimensional computer graphics, interactive techniques, and interface design. Students utilize cutting-edge technology to produce a vast array of dynamic work for the screen (computer, broadcast, mobile).

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:16pm EST
It's like a not boring Comp. graphics and design class

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:16pm EST
by boring i mean simple

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:23pm EST
o.o

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:23pm EST
you can get Ph. D in color

Steph DudakThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:23pm EST
Oh wait sorry hold on

Steph DudakThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:23pm EST
I need to read that still

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:23pm EST
holding

Steph DudakThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:24pm EST
That's pretty cool

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:24pm EST
its a master's

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:25pm EST
so like twice as much schoo

Steph DudakThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:26pm EST
Do it

Steph DudakThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:26pm EST
Yk apparently if I wanna apply to Syracuse I'll need a portfolio for architecture. Womp

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:27pm EST
like an architecture portfolio?

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:27pm EST
r a random shit portfolio?

Steph DudakThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:27pm EST
No not architecture necessarily. But it needs to be all sorts of stuff and it suggested it should include drawings from life

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:29pm EST
well you have tons of art stuff

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:29pm EST
and a bunch of architecture stuff as well

Steph DudakThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:29pm EST
None of its drawn from life

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:29pm EST
oh like look at a building

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:29pm EST
and recreate?

Steph DudakThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:29pm EST
And stuff drawn from photos and whatnot is not strong material for a portfolio

Steph DudakThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:30pm EST
Well I won't need to recreate it if I'm drawing a building that's in front of me lol

Steph DudakThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:32pm EST
I'm not that good at drawing from life though. Well I haven't really done much I guess you could say. I did that one painting at cattus but that's not really a legitimate depiction of the area , know what I mean? Idk so imma need to work on that. If I wanna apply there anyway

Steph DudakThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:32pm EST
The issue is the portfolio like. I can submit it online, but it's due January 15th

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:34pm EST
oh

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:34pm EST
that might be a bit more challenging i suppose

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:34pm EST
where is the school?

Steph DudakThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:36pm EST
In ny

Steph DudakThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:37pm EST
I'm pretty sure all the colleges I'm applying to are in PA. Then njit, and RPI and Syracuse are in NY

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:39pm EST
what else is in PA besides drexel?

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:39pm EST
and what is RPI?

Steph DudakThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:41pm EST
Philadelphia university. I actually haven't looked into that one as closely so idk if I've missed any deadlines. But RPI is rensselaer. Rensselaer polytechnic institute

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:42pm EST
that sounds like a fake name

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:42pm EST
so many big words

Steph DudakThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:48pm EST
Haha it's real though

Steph DudakThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:48pm EST
Annoying to try to pronounce

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:48pm EST
i would hope so

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:48pm EST
re-ne-se-li-ar?

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:48pm EST
nope

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:49pm EST
i added e's in extra places

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:49pm EST
i'll live just guessing

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:55pm EST
and college has now bored me

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:55pm EST
i'm gonna play flash games

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:55pm EST
just cuz

Steph DudakThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:57pm EST
Good idea

Steph DudakThursday, November 17, 2011 at 7:57pm EST
I should probably do the hw I didnt start yet

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 8:31pm EST
why didn't you mention that half an hour ago!

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 8:31pm EST
owait

Nick DevlinThursday, November 17, 2011 at 8:32pm EST

Nick DevlinFriday, November 18, 2011 at 5:10pm EST

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:28pm EST
RAWR. I'm working on an art project

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:29pm EST
that seems like a thing to be rawring about

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:30pm EST
yesss

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:30pm EST
it's actually coming along alright

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:30pm EST
well

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:30pm EST
i accidentally colored a line red on the mouth i wasnt suppsoed to

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
supposed

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
and i had a hard time covering it up, but i don't think it looks too bad

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
anyway. i'm kind of scared to like REALLY start coloring it

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
it looks amazing

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
like the skin really

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
colour it!

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
cause it's gonna be an actual skin color

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
thats different

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:31pm EST
BUT ANYWAY. i'm gonna send you a picture. of my progress. after i go back upstairs and wait for my food to be finished

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
i was gonna do it grey. but i tested that that & it would look weird.

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
then i was gonna do the whole thing monochromatic

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
but that was kinda weird too

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
then i decided to make the mouth red, and it looks really good with the greens i'm using

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:32pm EST
if this is the envy one then both of those sound odd

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:33pm EST
then i actually put together a normalish kinda good lookin skin tone color

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:33pm EST
so imma roll with it

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:33pm EST
exciting

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:33pm EST
and the idea is that envy is takin over the person. controlling it. so they haven't completely been taken over yet in the drawing obviously

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:33pm EST
judging by the slime randomly dripping

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
so it needs contrast

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
grey and monochrome don't really do that well

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
no no no

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
not those together

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
i was saying for the overall thing

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
like

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
her skin would've been grey

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
and the slime still green

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:34pm EST
but it looked ugly

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:35pm EST
so i'm not doing that

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:35pm EST
then i THOUGHT about doing it monochromatic but it wouldn't have looked as good if everything was green.

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:35pm EST
i don't think it gives the same effect

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:36pm EST
that way with normal skin, and red lips (which is the only facial feature you see, aside from the nose. and slime is pouring out of the mount) it looks more like a person. who's all dolled up

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:37pm EST
that sounds awesome

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:38pm EST
i know you must be thrilled to hear about this lol. how are you?

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:39pm EST
i am thrilled, i mean i do like half the work on these damn project Of course i want to see the end result of all my work :P

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:40pm EST
shut up lol

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:40pm EST
I ALSO DECIDED

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:41pm EST
?!?!?!

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:41pm EST
for the second one. the heart thing didnt make much sense if the emotions are controlling the person, so i think imma have the veins of the heart wrap around the persons arm and whatever

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:41pm EST
so much infection

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:41pm EST
i'm not sure what that really says

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:41pm EST
but

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:41pm EST
YEAH

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:43pm EST
i'm kind of excited about this now. but i also wanna find a way to do these without always using people in them. but idk if that'd work lol we'll see when the time comes

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:43pm EST
but yes

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:45pm EST
without people?

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:46pm EST
that's pretty difficult if your theme is centered on emotion

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:47pm EST
Yeah exactly. So idk. I don't usually draw people so this is odd to do, as I'm also sure my proportions are always since I don't properly draw them.

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:48pm EST
This persons head may be a little too small for her body but I don't really care about proportions to be quite honest, depending what's going on in the project

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:49pm EST
if you went really far out there you could use the weird proportions to relate to the emotion

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:49pm EST
obv is large head for ego

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:49pm EST
but you can expand into something actually creative

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:50pm EST
so this is the head in progress. The colors are much brighter in person and this is no where close to complete cause there's only one color in the slime and no skin color Yesss. That's a good idea though I was actually thinking about that for future things bc I didn't really take it into consideration in this one.

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:53pm EST
i like it

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:53pm EST
the blobs look cool

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:53pm EST
how are you gonna make it look all shiny

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:53pm EST
or is a different kind of slime

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:54pm EST
Once I get enough different colors in, itll look more slimeish. But I can always put in white or something in spots if it's not looking slimy enough

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:55pm EST
kk

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:55pm EST
just wondering

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:55pm EST
Yeah I'm gonna be using like four different greens

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:56pm EST
with your fancy new colourzz

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 6:56pm EST
I know :D. These are so great

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:04pm EST
whats your exact concentration?

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:04pm EST
have you found out yet?

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:06pm EST
Yeah I'm just gonna make it the control emotions have over people. It's more like the control people let their emotions take over them. Cause the people aren't struggling

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:07pm EST
But I'm stickin with the first explanation

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:09pm EST
more flexible

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:10pm EST
Exactly

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:10pm EST
Oh

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:10pm EST
I need to send you another picture hold on

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:10pm EST
?

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:10pm EST
holding

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:11pm EST
Idk if you'll be able to clearly see it though ugh

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:12pm EST
Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:12pm EST
Does that ooze all the way on the right of her shoulder look weird?

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:12pm EST
ye

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:12pm EST
s

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:13pm EST
I thought so too. Should I leave it empty though?

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:13pm EST
Cause I have the giant one on her other shoulder a

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:13pm EST
Nd then the other going down her neck

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:14pm EST
i think the one on the should is weird because it's unbalanced

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:14pm EST
like all the slime coming off it

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:14pm EST
is going to to one side

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:14pm EST
It's en route

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:14pm EST
ahhh

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:14pm EST
its climbing

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:14pm EST
All that slime is under and behind it

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:14pm EST
But

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:15pm EST
I still think its kind of awkward

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:15pm EST
i think its fine there

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:15pm EST
I don't want to make the ooze bigger though cause it'll look bad near the neck one

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:15pm EST
you just need to fix the slime trail

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:15pm EST
Maybe

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:15pm EST
Yeah

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:15pm EST
and making it smaller might help

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:15pm EST
I was gonna say maybe if I did that lol

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:16pm EST
Maybe I shouldn't make the slime go directly off the edge of the ooze

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:16pm EST
The front of it

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:17pm EST
I think that's making it kind of weird too. The other has like a sort of ring around the bottom of it yk

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:17pm EST
yeah idk

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:18pm EST
i'd say just mess with the trail and junk for a bit

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:18pm EST
and if you can't figure out

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 7:18pm EST
just delete it

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 8:12pm EST
It saddens me that the picture of this doesn't come out as bright as the drawing actually is

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 8:13pm EST
i always feel like coloured pencil never look as good in pictures

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 8:14pm EST
Changed the lighting to iridescent. Imma send you another progression picture, one sec!

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 8:15pm EST
Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 8:16pm EST
the slime ball you coloured so far looks really cool

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 8:17pm EST
Thanks :D. Hopefully I'll have this and part of the second one done Monday so I can show you in person

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 8:17pm EST
funfun

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 9:53pm EST

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 9:59pm EST
Scandals and corruption eventually pervaded his administration; one of his own cabinet and several of his appointees were eventually tried, convicted, and sent to prison for bribery or defrauding the federal government.

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 9:59pm EST
at least he wasn't a good one

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:01pm EST
Wasn't he assassinated

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:01pm EST
No

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:01pm EST

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:01pm EST

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:01pm EST
He was on my test

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:01pm EST
It took me like 20 mins to remember his name

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:03pm EST
wow

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:03pm EST

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:03pm EST

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:27pm EST
this is much more fun than animal names

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:28pm EST
You'll be a much happier person it you're miserable all the time It's more amusing if you know where that comes from

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:28pm EST
idk where its from

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:30pm EST
Have you ever watched totalbiscuit on YouTube? His channels actually total halibut wtf well it's one word obv. He used to cover wow stuff he does other games now. But he did a q and a video with Jesse cox from omfgcata. That's where he said it. Cause he's a pretty cynical guy. "the cynical Brit". And he was all cynicism is a very good thing Or something When he said that quote

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:31pm EST
It's like an hour long q and a video though. Id never be able to find it to show you lol. I found it pretty funny.

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:32pm EST
the name sounds familiar I doubt, I've ever followed him much though

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:33pm EST
if you ever find it I'd probly watch

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:33pm EST
that comma is very incorrectly placed in my first statement

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:33pm EST

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:35pm EST
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ylyd54rVS0&feature=youtube_gdata_player

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:35pm EST

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:35pm EST

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:38pm EST
You should

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:39pm EST
The bed is a bundle of paradoxes: we go to it with reluctance, yet we quit it with regret; we make up our minds every night to leave it early, but we make up our bodies every morning to keep it late.

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:39pm EST
fuck yeah

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:39pm EST
awesome quote

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:40pm EST
The big ooze didn't come out as good as the small one JSYK

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:40pm EST
Not happy

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:40pm EST
that is annoying

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:40pm EST
please don't be not happy

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:41pm EST
whatever the really word for that is

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:41pm EST
please be happy

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:41pm EST
please be not sad

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:41pm EST
or annoyed

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:41pm EST
depends on context

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:41pm EST
either way

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:41pm EST
meaning is the same

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:41pm EST
Too dark

Steph DudakSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:41pm EST
I'll make it not suck somehow

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:44pm EST

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 19, 2011 at 10:44pm EST

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:52pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:52pm EST
My second art project so far

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:52pm EST
yay!

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:52pm EST
That I most likely won't have done by tomorrow

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:52pm EST
probly

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:52pm EST
ya never know though

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:53pm EST
Well I still gotta do my lit stuff

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:53pm EST
This looks fucking good in pictures. Not as good in person imo lol. Skin is weird

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:54pm EST
it makes a lot more sense now than it did when i wsaw it at lunch

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:54pm EST
XD

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:54pm EST
I fixed the fingers

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:54pm EST
I don't like the middle one

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:55pm EST
it's bent incorrectly

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:55pm EST
Cause it's kind of awkward but yk. I'm really hesitant to color the rest of the heart though

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:55pm EST
but it looks kinda better crooked

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:55pm EST
makes it more painful looking

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:55pm EST
Yeeees

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:56pm EST
the heart

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:56pm EST
i feel like you should practice a few times with that one

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:56pm EST
the colors are gonna be all kinds of weird

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:56pm EST
I kinda wanna redraw this one but

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:56pm EST
Like I have colors I wanna use

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:57pm EST
It's just a matter of where to put them

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:57pm EST
Some parts need to be lighter but the heart isn't drawn like to scale with the picture I used

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:57pm EST
you have a couple references right?

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:57pm EST
Which is okay cause some of the parts were hard to place

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:58pm EST
The only thing is

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:58pm EST
Veins

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:58pm EST
& yeah

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:58pm EST
k good

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:58pm EST
what's wrong with veins?

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:58pm EST
See the colors there

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:59pm EST
It's just that this is the main picture im working from bc it's one of the best examples I can find. See how the veins are like bluish

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:59pm EST
they wouldn't look very vibrant

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 9:59pm EST
In some parts

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:00pm EST
Actually

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:00pm EST
They'll look fine. I can later colors easily

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:00pm EST
But it's more that I need to really watch it and make it not look weird

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:00pm EST
Cause the majority of this is reds and pinks and then you have this bit of blue

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:01pm EST
yeah

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:01pm EST
you'll just have to test it out

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:02pm EST
is this a rough draft

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:02pm EST
or first try or whatever

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:02pm EST
or final copy

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:03pm EST
Well I mean I'm turning it in. But depending on how it comes out when I finish it, i might try to redraw it

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:03pm EST
I also don't like what I just did with this red line on the hand algiejfb whatever

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:05pm EST
just draw!

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:05pm EST
looks fine so far

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:06pm EST
its not like you'll mess up and destroy the entire thing

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:06pm EST
or least i hope not

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:06pm EST
O.O

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:06pm EST
:D

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:06pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:07pm EST

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:07pm EST
i think i will

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:07pm EST
It's not like you'll be making people carefully watch every move they make after that

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:07pm EST
nope

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:08pm EST
they'll be carefree and totally pumped

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:08pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:15pm EST
You're a crackhead lol yes that is a very lovely status

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:15pm EST

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:16pm EST

Nick DevlinMonday, November 21, 2011 at 10:16pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:30am EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:30am EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:30am EST
alllrighty!

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:44am EST
so I showed up here like 20 minutes early

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:44am EST
Which is better than 20 late i suppose

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:48am EST
Well yes I suppose so lol

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:50am EST
Wanna see my heart drawing so far? That I'm kind of starting to dislike now that the whole things colored in

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:50am EST
-_- yes i want to see it, and you're not allowed to not like it

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:51am EST
._. Fine

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:51am EST
much better

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:51am EST
But some actual input would be nice. I haven't used my blender yet though, waiting til I'm completely finished to do do

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:52am EST
So *

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:52am EST
Idk why it corrects so. So is a word.

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:53am EST
heh you said doo doo

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:53am EST
and input would be it looks very much like a heart

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:53am EST
the blood trickle is a bit off

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:53am EST
it should be more emphasized

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:54am EST
I haven't worked on the hand yet lol

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:54am EST
Fixing that is next cause there's that and a spot by the finger that looks weird

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:55am EST
That I need to make not weird

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:55am EST
Then I gotta do the arm

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:55am EST
I see a couple tiny capillaries on the biggest vien looking thing, the top left part of heart the way it is oriented in that picture

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:55am EST
I feel like there should be more

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:55am EST
not like covered but 3 or 4 placed around might look more noticeable

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:57am EST
Alrighty

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:57am EST
idk I feel like you can just add tniny details that make it seem more gross and heartlike, nothing big

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:58am EST
I wonder if

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:58am EST
I could make it look more

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:58am EST
Not slimy looking

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 11:58am EST
But yk

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:00pm EST
do you want it too look slimy? Or do you want a different texture to the heart?

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:01pm EST
I want it to look like it was literally just ripped out of someone's chest

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:01pm EST
If I can make that work

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:01pm EST
Then you want slimy and wet

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:01pm EST
it should be dripping a lot as well

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:01pm EST
See all the wet shiny parts

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:01pm EST
Yes

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:02pm EST
more high lites, more completely white parts

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:03pm EST
and the texture should be a lot smoother for the red parts

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:03pm EST
burnishing i think its called?

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:03pm EST
whatever makes the colors look more solid

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:03pm EST
and less like colored pencil

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:03pm EST
Yeah

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:04pm EST
It'll also look smoother once I go over it with the marker but that'll help too

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:06pm EST
ohh marker, expanding your medium

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:07pm EST
No the blending marker lol

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:07pm EST
I should learn how to use actual markers though

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:07pm EST
markers are fun

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:08pm EST
especially sharpies

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:11pm EST
Yes very

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:11pm EST
Hm

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:12pm EST
I still need to think about what I'm gonna do for my next few projects. I wonder if I could do something in sharpie. Just black sharpie. Well I mean I literally could.

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:13pm EST
what emotion would go with that?

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:13pm EST
The project would have to be design based though. I have no idea

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:13pm EST
Oh

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:13pm EST
Um

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:13pm EST
I'd tell you if I could think of the name

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:13pm EST
describe it

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:15pm EST
Not really an emotion. Insanity maybe?

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:15pm EST
that sounds fun

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:15pm EST
and you would finally be able to do something without a person in it

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:16pm EST
Maaaybe

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:16pm EST
The whole ideas control of emotions right. I can have like

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:16pm EST
Hm

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:17pm EST
ohhh

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:17pm EST
These weird cracked out designs of some sort forming into something

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:17pm EST
Just a shape of a person

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:17pm EST
outline of a head with the chaos insde

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:17pm EST
Nothing too like

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:17pm EST
Yeah perhaps

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:18pm EST
Or an open head

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:18pm EST
With the chaos spewing out

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:18pm EST
and everything spilling out

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:18pm EST
Attaching itself to the person

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:18pm EST
And flying out

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:18pm EST
you like things attaching to people, slime hearts, chaos

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:19pm EST
Omg the designs could be like

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:19pm EST
Little people. But not people

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:19pm EST
Crazy little things

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:19pm EST
Attacking lol

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:19pm EST
Like Unknown but not.

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:20pm EST
Yk what I mean

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:20pm EST
It's fun from an animated perspective XD

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:21pm EST
These little things jumping all over a person, latching onto them, biting them, causing chaos, etc

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:21pm EST
tha'sfun sounding

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:21pm EST
what kind of little people?

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:21pm EST
monster looking things

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:21pm EST
stick people

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:22pm EST
normal people with torxches and pitchforkls

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:22pm EST
Yeah like stick things LOL ONG ACTUAL STICK PEOPLE.

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:22pm EST
Omg

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:22pm EST
But nah they'd be like

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:22pm EST
Well kinda like stick people but more distorted and have some sort of design to them

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:23pm EST
The person would have to look serene and pleasant.

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:23pm EST
And then start to have these ridiculous little things take over that really need to look like insanity

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:23pm EST
ugh time for actual church talk again later

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:23pm EST
keep brainstorming with yourself

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 12:24pm EST
Womp okay have fun

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 3:50pm EST
you gonna make this an animation?

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 3:50pm EST
the way you describe it makes it sounds like it

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:20pm EST
no i'm not. i'm just saying it looks fun from that perspective.

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:20pm EST
you should learn stop motion then animate it

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:20pm EST
wouldn't be THAt much work

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:20pm EST
psht naaah

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:20pm EST
i'd totally have time

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:21pm EST
omg that'd be so cool though

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:21pm EST
one afternoon at most it'd take

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:21pm EST
THAT'D BE SO COOL. I COULD MAKE LITTLE WEIRD LOOKIN FIGURINE THINGS AND USE REAL PEOPLE. but i couldn't have their head open

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:21pm EST
unless i get a figure of dr. finklestein. his head opens

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:22pm EST
you should do it one day

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:23pm EST
stop motion is so cool

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:23pm EST
that'd be cool if i had the time to do it

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:25pm EST
Stop motion is fun to watch, there's lots of cool things to do if you have enough time

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:25pm EST
i should get back into using photoshop.

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:25pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:26pm EST
nevermind

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:26pm EST
the problem is i have no idea what's going on with this guinevere section of this book (which apparently has three sections in it but it DOESN'T)

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:26pm EST
i don't hae time

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:26pm EST
guinevere?

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:26pm EST
arthurs chick that lancelot steals?

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:27pm EST
I don't remember much of those stories

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:27pm EST
yeah from some blahblahg of the king od camelot

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:27pm EST
yep

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:27pm EST
i was reading it

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:27pm EST
and i really have no idea what's going on

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:27pm EST
i wasn't retaining anything i read

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:27pm EST
then i fell asleep

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:27pm EST
this was like a little over an hour ago

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:27pm EST
Those books are fun

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:27pm EST
but the essa

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:27pm EST
y

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:27pm EST
is on

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:28pm EST
"max 3 page essay using close reading of the guinevere sections and close reading of morte d'arthur showing the thematic and stylistic differences." well from one section of guinevere. she said one of the three sections

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:28pm EST
but again

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:28pm EST
all i'm seeing is one giant seection

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:28pm EST
not three

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:28pm EST
and it's a million pages

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:29pm EST
and becca and tiff are not answering me sooooooooooooo

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:29pm EST
i'm receiving no help or answers to my questions.

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:30pm EST
if you're comparing thematic and style difference its not like you actually need to read

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:30pm EST
just compare the format and setting and generic stuff

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:30pm EST
hm yeah

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:30pm EST
you have a point actualy.

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:30pm EST
cause the book is written in like

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:31pm EST
it's written like a poem. morte d'arthur is written as just a regular story

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:31pm EST
also the dialogue is different in both. there's names for it that i have to look at my notes to remember. but morte d'arthur doesn't use quotations when people speak

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:31pm EST
this thing does

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:31pm EST
there ya go already started a section

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:32pm EST
but then the story itself i don't really know what's going on

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:32pm EST
does it ask about story?

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:34pm EST
well i don't mean it like i need to write about the story

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:34pm EST
but understanding it would help

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:34pm EST
to pick up on things that might be similar in morte d'arthur as far as character set up, etc

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:35pm EST
yeah probly, just skim it. then go on sparknotex for details

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:36pm EST
yeah might need to do that

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:36pm EST
i can totally do this right?

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:36pm EST
yeah i can

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:36pm EST
MAX 3 page

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:36pm EST
it can be less

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:36pm EST
ftw

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:36pm EST
i wrote a 9 page paper in like one day pretty much. i got this

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:38pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:38pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:39pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 4:47pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 8:20pm EST
My goal is to get shit done and be ~happier. Starting Monday. AP lit will ruin that I'm sure (there's the pessimism speaking) but I'll make it work I think

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 8:21pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 8:28pm EST
you're right

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 8:28pm EST
only people that use that stuff

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 8:28pm EST
are like humans

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 8:28pm EST
and who would want to be one of those

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 8:28pm EST
Obviously that was a subliminal message saying go study some basic math after you stop wasting time, distracting yourself, and do your homework.

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 8:29pm EST
Idk I'm not human

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 8:29pm EST
thanks for making it less subliminal

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 8:29pm EST
But I use basic math all the time

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 8:30pm EST
Everyone uses basic math all the time

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 8:31pm EST
school has actually understood that math is a useful topic to learn

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 8:31pm EST
and life is much easier when you know it

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 8:31pm EST
I wouldn't be able to do miecraft if I didn't know exponents

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 8:31pm EST
:D

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 8:31pm EST
I love being able to apply things like algebra and stuff to normal every day situations

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 8:32pm EST
i rarely use equations but fractions are fun to play with when I need real things done

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 8:33pm EST
Proportions

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 8:34pm EST
cooking and supplies

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 8:34pm EST
Math is a wonderful thing

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 8:35pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 8:38pm EST
Oh it can't just be like a normal name

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 8:38pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 8:39pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:27pm EST
I mean what

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:27pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:28pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:28pm EST
I like how I said Morgan

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:30pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:30pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:31pm EST
-___-

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:31pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:31pm EST
Is is not difficult

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:31pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:32pm EST
i need to know

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:32pm EST
i have the same problem

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:33pm EST
Jerkoff. My first paragraph is basically saying how Arthur is written in paragraph form like a story and Guinevere in stanzas like a poem. And Arthur's dialogue is in free direct speech and Guinevere is in direct speech

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:33pm EST
I feel like I should say like the purpose of those like techniques or whatever

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:33pm EST
But I dont really know the effects of them and don't personally find them important

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:33pm EST
you could explain the different time periods they were written in defined their structure

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:42pm EST
but i can't help with more more than that. unless there is text online of both your stories

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:42pm EST
Icould find a couple points as long as its your work

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:42pm EST
if it was my homework i would never be able to find shit

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:42pm EST
The definitely is of Guinevere

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:42pm EST
But the thing is

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:43pm EST
She said to use out close reading of Arthur and such to do this

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:43pm EST
close reading?

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:43pm EST
Yeah picking apart every little thing in a story basically

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:43pm EST
I don't really know what's going on in Guinevere though

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:43pm EST
But

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:44pm EST
Max three page using close reading of section of Guinevere and of Arthur showing the thematic and stylistic differences

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:47pm EST
yeah, you wont be having afun time with that

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:48pm EST
well i doubt you have been

Steph DudakSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:48pm EST
Tu as raison -.-

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:49pm EST
only when I don't want to be

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:50pm EST
ugh, I need to sleep tonight. I hope you find a way to get all your stuff done

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:51pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 27, 2011 at 10:51pm EST

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:25pm EST

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:26pm EST
glad to be of use

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:29pm EST

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:29pm EST
-.-

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:29pm EST
weren't you supposed to have that downloaded like over the summer?

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:29pm EST

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:32pm EST
sigh

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:32pm EST
only 2% of my life so far

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:32pm EST
calm down

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:32pm EST
2.9%

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:33pm EST
i am calm lol

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:35pm EST
well for the most part

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:35pm EST
but it's not concerning you so it's ok

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:35pm EST
what aren't you calm about?

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:40pm EST
"I wave my right to review or access letters and statements of recommendation on my behalf." is that something i should check off

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:41pm EST
ye

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:41pm EST
i went and asked guidance about it

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:41pm EST
they helped in absolutely no way

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:42pm EST
They couldn't explain what the hell it meant

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:42pm EST
alrighty

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:42pm EST
annnd

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:42pm EST
what if

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:43pm EST
oh

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:43pm EST
nevermind again

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:43pm EST
mkay

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:43pm EST
apparently i can't read

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:44pm EST
well i beg to differ

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:44pm EST
and if you disagree then i am correct

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:44pm EST
otherwise you have introduced a paradox

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:44pm EST
sklhjf;sh

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:44pm EST
then again

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:44pm EST
maybe you cant read

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:45pm EST
so did you send in your sat scores through collegeboard? is that required? cause there's a thing on this blue sheet that says "I would like my test scores mailed with my application" I hope you don't mind me bombarding you with questions

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:45pm EST
its fine

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:46pm EST
I am sending my stuff through collegeboard

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:46pm EST
i don't trust the school

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:46pm EST
lol

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:46pm EST
yeah my only concern is that it's a pain in the ass since sending through collegeboard you need to pay $10.50

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:46pm EST
i hate money i hate school

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:47pm EST
2 of the biggest reasons I am procastinating so much

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:48pm EST
like ugh

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:48pm EST
I keep hoping I'll find a way for everything to get done for free

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:48pm EST
but I doubt that will happen

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:48pm EST
i had to pay to take tests i don't wanna take. i have to pay to apply to college. i need to pay to have my SAT scores sent to them.

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:48pm EST
if i get accepted and go there i need to pay to go there.

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:48pm EST
fun stuff

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:49pm EST
assuming i'd get accepted, i should just go to njit. yeah. cool

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:49pm EST
don't forget paying all that money just so you can apply to get a job

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:49pm EST
omg

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:49pm EST
yeah

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:49pm EST
i should become a nomad

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:50pm EST
and live off the land?

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:50pm EST
and become one with nature

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:50pm EST
well there isn;t much of that left

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:50pm EST
that either

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:50pm EST
yeah

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:50pm EST
i'll build my own cottage. chop down my own trees and stuff. or something.

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:50pm EST
just kidding

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:50pm EST
that won't happen

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
i'll just spend all of this money and go to college anyway

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
and then have to pay off all this debt

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 4:51pm EST
then go be a nomad

No New Essay Required ... It’s not required but, if you’d like, copy or send to us one of your best essays or stories. Or tell us about an achievement or an ability not reflected in this application. >:|

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:00pm EST
i feel like thats a trick. like i should do that

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:00pm EST
just do it

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:00pm EST
don't write a new one if you've already made a good one

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:03pm EST
i haven't made a good one

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:03pm EST
so i shall write one soon

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:04pm EST
i wish i could copy and paste from this website. rawr.: physical science - a solid background, including physics; in the spring semester of the 1st year, architecture students take physics. prior experience with the subject matter is beneficial

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:04pm EST
love physics

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:05pm EST
i actually probably would like physics if i understood it better. did i tell you. i didn't. he decided to hand out notes this time. so i'll have to rewrite them so a) i can read them and b) i actually retain some of the information before i go back to study it again

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:05pm EST
and again

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:09pm EST
physics is really cool

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:09pm EST
i only like the theory though

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:09pm EST
not the math

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:09pm EST
although the math might be fun if i had an awesome teacher

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:10pm EST
but i don't think those are too common

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:10pm EST
not reallly

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:11pm EST
I still watch lots of videos and tv shows about physics and astrophysics

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:15pm EST
because that's an acceptable qualification for college

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:16pm EST
i'd like to think so

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:16pm EST
XD

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:18pm EST
fun fact

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:18pm EST
syracuse is about 5 hours away from my house

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:18pm EST
that is a fun fact

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:18pm EST
you can make it

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:18pm EST
RPI is about 4

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:19pm EST

fun fact

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:21pm EST
rochsester is about 7 hours

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:21pm EST

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:21pm EST
it cost 700 for a plane there

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:21pm EST
unles

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:21pm EST
i drive to philly and get a plane ride from that airport

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:21pm EST
in which case

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:21pm EST
it is 300

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:21pm EST
which makes sense

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:21pm EST
woah

ugh good question

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:28pm EST
i probably should

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:28pm EST
simply because they are so far away and i am unfamiliar with the area they are in. RPI is actually pretty close to where my friend alex lives

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:28pm EST

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:28pm EST

The Albert Dorman Honors College The Albert Dorman Honors College offers an engaging learning environment for students seeking intellectual challenge beyond NJIT's standard curriculum. Students in the Dorman Honors College will have opportunities to conduct research, study abroad and participate in co-ops & internships above and beyond the exceptional opportunities offered to all students at NJIT. Students admitted to the Dorman Honors College typically receive a merit scholarship package covering tuition expenses and have SAT scores above 1300 (critical reading + math) and rank in the top 10% of their graduating class. You'll be provided a link to the Albert Dorman Honors application once you submit your Highlander Priority Application.

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:38pm EST

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:40pm EST

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:43pm EST

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:43pm EST
this may be a dumb question but are letters of recommendations general? like if you need em sent for a few colleges is it just like one sent out multiple times or am i going to need to get different letters written each time i apply to some place.

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:44pm EST
no, you should get letters from people that are relevant to your major

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:45pm EST
as long as you are taking the same major at each school

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:45pm EST
you use the same letteres

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:45pm EST

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:46pm EST

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:46pm EST

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
The Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) is a state funded program for New Jersey students who are educationally and economically challenged and who are greatly underrepresented in science and technological fields.

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:56pm EST
greatly underrepresented?

Steph DudakTuesday, November 29, 2011 at 7:57pm EST
New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) was among the earliest higher education institutions in the State to accept the challenge posed by the New Jersey Department of Higher Education to "identify, recruit and provide financial assistance to needy students who are residents of this State in order that they may be able to attend institutions of higher education." In response to this challenge, the Engineering Opportunity Program was established in 1968. It was renamed the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) in 1975 to reflect its broader mission of providing access to other areas of study at the university, including architecture, science, and business. From an initial enrollment of 19 students, EOP has grown to over 650 currently enrolled. The university has consistently displayed strong commitment to and support for EOP, and provides adequate resources to assure the Program's success.
