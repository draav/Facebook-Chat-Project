Steph DudakSaturday, June 8, 2013 at 12:09pm EDT

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 8, 2013 at 12:13pm EDT

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 8, 2013 at 12:14pm EDT

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 8, 2013 at 12:14pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, June 8, 2013 at 12:20pm EDT

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 8, 2013 at 12:21pm EDT
I know! So exciting but my mom left me here so im just waiting

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 8, 2013 at 1:58pm EDT
So its at 3

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 12:58am EDT
so js i wish i started that mturk thing a little bit earlier since it holds whatever you make for a 10 day period

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 12:59am EDT
but that's okay

Nick DevlinSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:07am EDT
Really? Didnt know that

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:09am EDT
yes it changes the status of things to like "accepted - payment pending" or whatever

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:09am EDT
but it holds it for 10 active days. you need to submit 3 hits a day for 10 unique days

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:10am EDT
luckily i just submitted one, and it counted for the 8th >:D cause i only submitted two lol

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:10am EDT
but i have $4.33 pending, woo! haha. some of these surveys are kind of interesting some are super irritating

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:10am EDT
but i did them anyway cause i already started it

Nick DevlinSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:11am EDT
Pretty much how it works

Nick DevlinSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:11am EDT
Some are just really weird

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:14am EDT
i took this one today oh jesus okay so

Nick DevlinSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:16am EDT
Were you cut off or still writing?

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:16am EDT
it was this "family feud" thing right. so it starts off with like dumb questions. then it's like OKAY! family feud practice rounds! one you have barely any time, the other you'll have more time. answer whatchu can! (it was like a. i don't remember how much it paid but you get entered for a chance to win a $25 amazon giftcard so i was like meh why not whatev family feud). so you do those. and it's like whatever. THEN AFTER. it gives me a super nonsensical paragraph, in which i need to click all the "e"s. after 3 mins the next button would appear. it was more than one paragraph actually. i only did the first like paragraph after WANTING TO KILL MYSELF

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:16am EDT
AND THEN AFTER THAT

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:16am EDT
IT GAVE ME ANOTHER, BUT THIS ONE HAD RULES

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:17am EDT
1) don't press the "e"s with vowels right after them (ie bear) 2) don't press the "e"s with vowels two letters before it (ie vowel)

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:17am EDT
BUT THIS TIME

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:17am EDT
it was SEVEN MINUTES TIL THE NEXT BUTTON APPEARED

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:17am EDT
AND I WANTED TO DIE and it was like lolol testing u NOW HERE'S A FIVE MINUTE BREAK PERIOD

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:17am EDT
WHICH I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO SKIP

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I HAD TO DO FOR THAT "BREAK"?

Nick DevlinSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
Ahahaha Sounds awesome. Was it one of those psych test tjings

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
they put up NATURE PICTURES

Nick DevlinSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
Ahahaha Sounds awesome. Was it one of those psych test tjings

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
for like 10 seconds each

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
THEN IT ASKED ME IF I LIKED THEM AND I SAID NO OUT OF SPITE

Nick DevlinSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
To sooth your minf

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
and then it was like yeah did that break help you? and i'm like no

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
i don't want a break

Nick DevlinSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
Destress

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
it was boring

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
i just want to go through the rest of this thing

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:19am EDT
and it asked more questions like that and it was like

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:19am EDT
this is the best part

Nick DevlinSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:19am EDT
Cant wait

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:19am EDT
so we basically wanted to test you and your patience and basically see if you'd actually finish this because you are not going to actually be playing family feud, even though right before the break we told you that you were going to be playing a time rich version of it CONGRATULATIONS

Nick DevlinSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:20am EDT
Ahahahaha totally a psych test

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:20am EDT
but yeah it was a cognitive test

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:20am EDT
and it was just like ._.

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:20am EDT
what breaks when you drop it on the ground? Glass Lightbulb really lightbulb hm wow great

Nick DevlinSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:20am EDT
Sounds awesome how much was it? Like moniez

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:21am EDT
lol like 50 cents + the maybe chance at a $25 giftcard

Nick DevlinSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:21am EDT
Fifty cents is pretty decent

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:22am EDT
i've done a couple pretty decent ones like

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:22am EDT
i did maybe 4 or so, give or take idk that were like $1, one was 1.92 and like 50, 80 cents. and some 30

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:22am EDT
it adds up once it's approved and i'm not doing things anyway so i figured why not

Nick DevlinSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:23am EDT
Damn

Nick DevlinSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:23am EDT

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:24am EDT
yeah i need to start making some sort of something somehow within the next month. it's really unfortunate that rich's birthday and our anniversary are pretty close together. i'm still trying to decide what to do for his birthday?

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:24am EDT
well

Nick DevlinSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:24am EDT
Its fumny you say that because i found this site from a subreddit called beermoney

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:25am EDT
i need to get a 20x20 frame, cause i'm gonna give him my concept drawing. with the triangles and such

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:25am EDT
beermoney? lol

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:25am EDT
and i wanted to get him a pair of philau sweatpants bc 1) he wants a pair and has no sweatpants and theyre comfy

Nick DevlinSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:25am EDT
Yeah kust easy ways to make a little money when bored

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:25am EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:26am EDT
Yes you d

Nick DevlinSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:26am EDT
Did

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:26am EDT
he called dibs on it after i drew it and i told him he could have it but idk if he remembers that lol

Nick DevlinSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:26am EDT
Possible

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:26am EDT
yes i want to get these ones i think http://www.amazon.com/Necklaces-Double-Lucky-Black-Crystals/dp/B002V4XQRM/ref=pd_sbs_jw_2/176-1265683-8593048 instead of the ones that have the silver ying yang things on the top

Nick DevlinSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:27am EDT
Those are amazing

Nick DevlinSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:27am EDT
If you dont get them i totally am

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:27am EDT
plus cheaper lol and they're still nice and stuff. i'm going to get them. and i'm gonna give him the black one

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:27am EDT
they're so nice omg i was going through their other stuff

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:27am EDT
so many cool things

Nick DevlinSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:28am EDT
I will be browsing through

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:29am EDT
i was kind of iffy on getting necklaces because i know he always has that coin one on. like he never takes it off. so i dunno that he'd wear it often. but it's still nice and i'm sure he would wear it at some point since it's still ~manly~ and it's for both of us and i know he'd appreciate it so there's still winning lol

Nick DevlinSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:30am EDT
It sounds like a good idea to me

Nick DevlinSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:30am EDT
And i know rich is so concerned about his manly aura

Nick DevlinSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:31am EDT
So good you took it into account

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:31am EDT
well you know what i mean :P. It's not a girly necklace

Nick DevlinSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:31am EDT

Steph DudakSunday, June 9, 2013 at 1:33am EDT
