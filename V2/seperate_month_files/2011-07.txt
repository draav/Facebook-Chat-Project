Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:10pm EDT
then becoming a spirit then dying as soon as i find my body

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:10pm EDT
...

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:10pm EDT
why?

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:10pm EDT
...because I'm not good?

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:10pm EDT
well that's not it

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:11pm EDT
WHY are you dying?

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:11pm EDT
is it just mobs? or are you running into areas where you get flagged for pvp

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:11pm EDT
the monsters are the same level as me and i have bad strategy?

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:11pm EDT
and how many are you going for at once?

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:11pm EDT
usually 1

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:11pm EDT
then 5 more find me

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:12pm EDT
wait

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:12pm EDT
i can say mobs instead of monsters

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:12pm EDT
i thought that was only minecraft for some reason

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:12pm EDT
haha

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:12pm EDT
well thats an issue. you should really look where you're running into first

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:13pm EDT
you can generally see a wide range in front of you and where others are

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:13pm EDT
that way you can decide which you should actually target

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:13pm EDT
and you can heal yourself in combat

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:13pm EDT
i mean you dont always need to be in cat form

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:13pm EDT
i know

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:13pm EDT
but i'm not good at changing form in battle

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:14pm EDT
and the human form does little to no damage anymore

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:14pm EDT
well noticeable damage anyway

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:14pm EDT
which spells are you using

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:14pm EDT
...hmm

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:15pm EDT
i usually use some magic attack to start with when they are far away a couple times

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:15pm EDT
then use this thorn thing that protects me

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:15pm EDT
from melee

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:15pm EDT
tthan i use instant speel that does medium damage

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:15pm EDT
until they die

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
okay that does not help me at all

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
i know

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
but if you're gonna use thorns i'd start off with that

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
i tried

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
then use... whatever else there is..

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
you have what

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
thanks!

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
wrath, starfall?

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
starfall

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
first

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
then wrath when they are close

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
is starfall an instant cast?

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
no

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
or is it channeled or what?

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:17pm EDT
i have two that are really similar, one is an instant cast that does little damage

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:17pm EDT
the other takes acouple damage but does a lot

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:17pm EDT
takes a couple seconds*

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:18pm EDT
hm

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:18pm EDT
you should learn the names of your spells loll hold on

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:18pm EDT
i'm not on my normal computer so i can't check

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:19pm EDT
http://www.wowhead.com/spells=7.11.574

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:19pm EDT
balance abilities

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:19pm EDT
http://www.wowhead.com/spells=7.11.134

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:19pm EDT
feral abilities

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:20pm EDT
alright so for balanced I use:

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:21pm EDT
-starfire before they notice me since it takes forever to load -thorns while they are on way to attack me -spam moonfire until they die with occaional wrath when i'm bored

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:21pm EDT
feral:

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:23pm EDT
-rake -mangle a bunch of times for combo -Ferocious bite -mangle a bunch of times for combo -ferocious bite until they die

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:24pm EDT
thats it

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:24pm EDT
you dont ever use claw?

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:24pm EDT
no its the same as mangle just weaker

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:24pm EDT
i think

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:25pm EDT
i'm probably wrong though

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:25pm EDT
well i dunno the percents at your level lol so. but

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:27pm EDT
make sure when you're using mangle, that rake is up on your target. rake does additional bleed dmg over 9 sec? and the target takes a certain % (idk if its 30 for you rn, but it is at 85 soo whatever percent it is) additional damage from bleed effects for a minute. as far as your balance abilities go, take care of all your casting spells first

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:28pm EDT
i'd* take care of

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:28pm EDT
that's just me

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:28pm EDT
so like

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:28pm EDT
starfire and thorns okay. you can throw up entangling roots while youre casting wrath

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:28pm EDT
and then moonfire/wrath/ etc whatever

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:28pm EDT
oh right thats slows enemy yeah?

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:29pm EDT
entangling roots entangles them in roots

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:29pm EDT
thanks!

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:29pm EDT
which are broken once dmg is done

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:29pm EDT
and then in between if youre running low on health you can cast rejuvenation, cause it's instant

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:29pm EDT
it'll heal you over time

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:30pm EDT
aight

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:30pm EDT
i think once you get to level 30, you can dual spec

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:30pm EDT
damn i guess i need to buy this now

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:31pm EDT
WAIT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:31pm EDT
?!?!?!

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:31pm EDT
you are filling out your talent tree along the way right?

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:31pm EDT
yeah...

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:31pm EDT
everytime you get a new point available

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:31pm EDT
okay

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:31pm EDT
just making sure

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:31pm EDT
i am

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:31pm EDT
i can just ignore bear stuff right??

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:31pm EDT
i really dont like the bear

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:32pm EDT
that's the idea

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:32pm EDT
awesome

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:32pm EDT
idk how the feral tree works really as far as talent points go

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:32pm EDT
are there separate talents for bear form & cat form?

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:32pm EDT
yeah some

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:33pm EDT
some increase attack for either form

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:33pm EDT
i think thats what it was saying

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:33pm EDT
oh!

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:33pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:37pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:44pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:44pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:44pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:45pm EDT
If you are able to read the story though, it is the most hilarious thing I've ever read

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:45pm EDT
ever

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:46pm EDT
For example today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets and black combat boots. I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner and red eye shadow. I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of preps stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:46pm EDT
lmao

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:47pm EDT
the entire story is like that, and it only gets better as you keep reading

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:47pm EDT
i particularly love the author' notes

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:47pm EDT

My favorite part of the entire story

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:48pm EDT
“WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING YOU MOTHERFUKERS!” It was…………………………………………………….Dumbledore!

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:50pm EDT
The next day I woke up in my bedroom. It was snowing and raining again. I opened the door of my coffin and drank some blood from a bottle I had.

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:50pm EDT
hahahaha wtf

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:51pm EDT
i love this story eepecially the constant hypocrisy of hating mainstream prepz while loving my chemical romance and hot topic

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:51pm EDT
I gasped. Chapter 3.

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:51pm EDT
i like the abrupt endings

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:51pm EDT
this is hilarious

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:52pm EDT
glad to know you agree

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:52pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:52pm EDT
I felt a little depressed then, so I slit one of my wrists

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:52pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:52pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:53pm EDT
“Hi Draco!” I said in a depressed voice

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:54pm EDT
i didn't know shouting was depressing

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:54pm EDT
Draco and I crawled back into the Mercedes-Benz, but Draco didn’t go back into Hogwarts, instead he drove the car into……………………… the Forbidden Forest! Chapter 4.

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:55pm EDT
what's gunna happen next?!!

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:55pm EDT
apparently shes gonna yell at draco

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:55pm EDT
Draco leaned in extra-close and I looked into his gothic red eyes (he was wearing color contacts) which revealed so much depressing sorrow and evilness and then suddenly I didn’t feel mad anymore

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:55pm EDT
nope

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:55pm EDT
she's not

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:55pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:56pm EDT
dumbledore had a headache that day

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:56pm EDT
“You ludacris fools!” he shouted. I started to cry tears of blood down my pallid face.

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:56pm EDT
that mediocre dunce

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:57pm EDT
BTW I wont rite da nxt chapter til I git TIN god vons!

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:58pm EDT
“My name’s Harry Potter, although most people call me Vampire these days.” he grumbled. “Why?” I exclaimed. “Because I love the taste of human blood.” he giggled.

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:58pm EDT
so glad she got tin god vons

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 7:58pm EDT
just for that line

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:00pm EDT
i like how it just switched perspective wtf

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:01pm EDT
it took a couple reads through each chapter just to kno what the hell is happening

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:01pm EDT
Then all of a suddenly, an horrible man with red eyes and no nose and everything started flying towards me on a broomstick!

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:01pm EDT
all of a suddenly

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:02pm EDT
i just love that voldemort has shakespearean speech patterns

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:03pm EDT
Voldemort got a dude-ur-so-retarded look on his face. “I hath telekinesis.” he answered cruelly. “And if you doth not kill Vampire, then thou know what will happen to Draco!” he shouted. Then he flew away angrily on his broomstick.

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:03pm EDT
he angrily flew away

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:03pm EDT
angrily

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:04pm EDT
and Vampire was probably watching a depressing movie like The Corpse Bride.

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:04pm EDT
that movie isn't depressing though

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:04pm EDT
it is when your GOFFIK

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:04pm EDT
Emily is free at the end

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:05pm EDT
and victor and victoria get married and the guy that killed emily dies so all is well

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:06pm EDT
shh don't tell here that

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:07pm EDT
her*

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:07pm EDT
“What the fuck do you think?” I asked angrily. And then I said. “Well, Voldemort came and the fucking bastard told me to fucking kill Harry! But I don’t want to kill him, because, he’s really nice, even if he did go out with Draco. But if I don’t kill Harry, then Voldemort, will fucking kill Draco!” I burst into tears. Suddenly Draco jumped out from behind a wall.

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:07pm EDT
i guess his name is harry now

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:08pm EDT
don't ever try to point out flaws in the writing and plot

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:08pm EDT
it is a bottomless pit you will never escape

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:08pm EDT
“Ebony Draco has been found in his room. He committed suicide by slitting his wrists.”

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:08pm EDT
i can see that haha

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:09pm EDT
completely ignore this line when you read that though

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:09pm EDT
I knew Draco was probably slitting his wrists (he wouldn’t die because he was a vampire too and the only way you can kill a vampire is with a c-r-o-s-s (there’s no way I’m writing that) or a steak)

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:09pm EDT
“Abra Kedavra!” he yelled at Snape and Loopin pointing his womb. I took my gun and shot Snape and Loopin a gazillion times and they both started screaming and the camera broke. Suddenly, Dumblydore ran in. “Ebony, it has been revealed that someone has - NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!” he shouted looking at Snape and Loopin and then he waved his wand and suddenly…

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:10pm EDT
haha i know

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:10pm EDT
...?

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:10pm EDT
that's what i just read

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:10pm EDT
i need to know what happens after the elipisis!

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:10pm EDT
apparently hagrid is a satanist

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:11pm EDT
of course he is

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:11pm EDT
he's also a pedophile

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:12pm EDT
but not really since he's younger in this version

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:13pm EDT
omg

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:14pm EDT
the spelling and grammar is just getting worse and worse i can't handle it

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:14pm EDT
oh yeah

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:14pm EDT
raven is her editor

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:14pm EDT
eventually they get into an arguement or something

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:14pm EDT
Then I put on black fishnets and black high-heeled boots with pictures of Billie Joe Armstrong on them.

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:14pm EDT
so raven stop fixing all the errors

“I thought you didn’t have a scar anymore!” I shouted. “I do but Diabolo changed it into a pentagram for me and I always cover it up with foundation.” he said back. “Anyway my scar hurt and then I had a vision of what was happening to Draco…………….Volfemort has him bondage!”

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:16pm EDT

“No.” he said meanly. “I don’t give a darn what Voldemort does to Draco. Not after how much he misbehaved in school especially with YOU Ebony.” he said while he frowned looking at me. “Besides I never liked him that much anyway.” then he walked away.

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:21pm EDT
i never liked him very much, voldemort can kill him

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:21pm EDT
I took a razor and started to slit my wrists. I drank the blood all depressed.

I could see him crying blood in a gothic way (geddit, way lik Gerard) but I didn’t say anything. “I bet he’s havin a mid-life crisis!” Willow shouted. I was so fucking angry.

“No one fucking understands me!1” he shouted angrily as his black hare went in his big blue eyes like Billie Joe in Boulevard of Borken Dreamz. He was wearing black baggy paints, a black MCR t-shirt and a black die. (geddit insted of tie koz im goffik) I was wearing a blak leather low cut top with chains all over it all over it a blak leather mini, black high held boots and a cross belly fing. My hair was al up in a messy relly high bun like Amy Lee in Gong Under. (email me if u wana see da pik) “Accuse me? What about me!” I growled. “Buy-but-but-” he grunted. “You fucking bastard!” I moaned. “No! Wait! It’s not what it fucking looks like!” he shouted. But it was to late. I knew what I herd. I ran to the bathroom angrily, cring.

Nick DevlinSunday, July 3, 2011 at 8:36pm EDT

YOU MUST RETRY OR VOLDEMORT WILL KILL YOUR STUDENTS!” “Very well.” Dumbledore said angrily. “Butt we cannot do this. We can’t close the school. There is only one person who is capable of killing Voldemort and she is in the school. And her name is…………………………………………………………………..Enony Dark’ness Dementia Raven Way.” Draco, Crab, Goyle, Darkness, Willow, Vampire and B’loody Mary looked at each other………I gasped.

If thou does not kill him before then I shall kill Draco too!” Darth Valer. So now we're in a star wars spinoff

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 9:06pm EDT
“Its ok gurl.” said B’loody Mary. “Maybe u should ask Proffesor Sinister about what the visions mean though.” professor sinister.. To Proffessor Trevolry

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 9:07pm EDT
Konnichiwa everybody come in.” said Proffesor Sinister in Japanese .. Now it's sinister again, and she also knows Japanese. I think this teacher is schizophrenic.

Steph DudakSunday, July 3, 2011 at 9:09pm EDT
O cuz she iz Japanese. “Okay you can go now, see ya cunt.” said Proffesor Sinister. “Bye bitch.” I said waving. That's awfully rude.

B’lody Mary, Socrates and Draco, Vampire and Willow were their to. (Lmfao Socrates) “STFU!1” shooted Cornelia Fuck. “He is in Azkhabian now wif Snip and Loopin he is old and week he has kancer. “Now do ur work!111” Some of my personal favourite lines

what do you get for completing quest?

Steph DudakSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
i meant what do you get for the world tree wuest

Nick DevlinSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
what do marks do?

Steph DudakSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:44pm EDT
well these marks are for another quest. you get 16 g along with that too. but i did another quest just like this (so it's 300 total marks) and i guess it goes to restoring this tree in game. cause yaknow, firelands! rawr everythings being destroyed. druids need help. i'm assuming somethings gonna happen once i finish this quest but idk

BUT LOOK AT MY UI. it's so good looking now.

Steph DudakSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
thats a lot of well organized little squares you have

Steph DudakSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
all of my wonderful abilities

Steph DudakSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
not having to switch between action bars

Nick DevlinSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
you can do that?!

Steph DudakSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
recount's actually working now

Nick DevlinSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
wtf

Steph DudakSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
do what?

Nick DevlinSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:50pm EDT
have it so you dont awitch action bars

Nick DevlinSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:50pm EDT
switch*

Steph DudakSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT
what no i mean. you know how you have action bar 1, like the main one? and then if you press the up or down arrow on the side (or shift+down/up on your keyboard) it goes to actionbar 2 or 6? i used to have to do that to use certain abilities

Steph DudakSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT
but you can also

Steph DudakSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT
put one of those bars on top, if you go to the WoW interface and go to actionbars or whatever

Steph DudakSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
and check the box for right or left. and that's one of em. so it'll show up on top of the main one

Nick DevlinSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
that would have been really useful

Steph DudakSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
but even still. that's why i downloaded bartender 4. because i can put all of em together, keybind whatever i have to, and it's all right there and neat

Steph DudakSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
but

Steph DudakSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
if you're switching specs/forms or whatever (in your case) your abilities in your actionbars are going to change.

Steph DudakSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
because of the fact that you can't use balance abilities while you're in cat form

Nick DevlinSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
i know that its kind of annoying

Nick DevlinSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
ti can use any talents or whatever they're called either

Steph DudakSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
you can only be in one spec at a time lol. if you're specced balance you shouldn't really have to be using any feral abilities and vice versa. that's why it's a main spec. and then when you want to use a different one you can switch to your off spec (once youre even able to dual spec at 30)

Nick DevlinSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
Does this chat thing do the same as messaging?

Steph DudakSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
yes?

Nick DevlinSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
Awesome

Nick DevlinSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
On iPod now

Steph DudakSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
It is a form of torture in some countries I believe

Steph DudakSunday, July 17, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
i wouldnt doubt it

Nick DevlinSunday, July 17, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
Did I mention Doug got put in time out for 15 minutes?

Nick DevlinSunday, July 17, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
Cause he did

Nick DevlinSunday, July 17, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
It's hilarious

Steph DudakSunday, July 17, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 17, 2011 at 11:12pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 17, 2011 at 11:12pm EDT

Anything exciting on your end?

Steph DudakMonday, July 18, 2011 at 1:27am EDT
Uh I'm laying in bed watching my wife and kids. It's not my idea of exciting, really

Nick DevlinMonday, July 18, 2011 at 1:33am EDT
You have a tv in your room?!

Nick DevlinMonday, July 18, 2011 at 1:34am EDT

Steph DudakMonday, July 18, 2011 at 2:11am EDT
Haha I don't watch much tv.

Nick DevlinMonday, July 18, 2011 at 7:17am EDT
I never watch tv, but its the principle of the thing, you know.

Nick DevlinMonday, July 18, 2011 at 7:18am EDT
TV is for hooking up video games to and watching netflix on.

Steph DudakMonday, July 18, 2011 at 2:04pm EDT
yeahhh there's that too

Nick DevlinMonday, July 18, 2011 at 11:56pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 19, 2011 at 12:18am EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, July 19, 2011 at 12:19am EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, July 19, 2011 at 12:51am EDT
i'm pretty sure it's in a different language

Steph DudakTuesday, July 19, 2011 at 12:52am EDT
well no it is

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 19, 2011 at 12:53am EDT
it sounds fine to me

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 19, 2011 at 12:53am EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, July 19, 2011 at 12:58am EDT
you guess letters, but you have so many strikes

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 19, 2011 at 12:58am EDT
ahh

Steph DudakTuesday, July 19, 2011 at 12:58am EDT
once all strikes are used up, if you don't guess the word, you lose a balloon

Steph DudakTuesday, July 19, 2011 at 12:58am EDT
the point is to keep your balloons

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 19, 2011 at 12:58am EDT
gotcha

Steph DudakTuesday, July 19, 2011 at 12:58am EDT
otherwise you fall into what looks like a giant pit of lava..

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 19, 2011 at 12:59am EDT
its very fun looking lava

Steph DudakTuesday, July 19, 2011 at 12:59am EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 19, 2011 at 1:00am EDT

whaaat?

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 9:32pm EDT
minecraft

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 9:32pm EDT

Steph DudakFriday, July 29, 2011 at 9:32pm EDT
oooo

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 9:33pm EDT
i spent a couple weeks learning how to use it

Steph DudakFriday, July 29, 2011 at 9:33pm EDT
i'm assuming it's beneficial to learn?

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 9:33pm EDT
yep

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 9:33pm EDT
no one else wants to learn since its pretty complex

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 9:34pm EDT
so they just pay me materials to creat circuits for the

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 9:34pm EDT
them*

Steph DudakFriday, July 29, 2011 at 9:34pm EDT
ahhh yeah that's always fun

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 9:34pm EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 9:34pm EDT
I can create giant tic tac toe boards that work using buttons

Steph DudakFriday, July 29, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT
its kinda like computer progamming actually

Steph DudakFriday, July 29, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT
that sounds like fun XD

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT
more fun than walking in a random direction

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT
yeo

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT
tlava burns you

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT
burning kills

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT
all items are dropped

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT
and lava destroys dropped items

Steph DudakFriday, July 29, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
very realistic

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
yep

Steph DudakFriday, July 29, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
that's really unfortunate though lol

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
thats why mods are fun!

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
to take away realism

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
anyway

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
normally when you die all you items are just sitting there on the ground and you can go back and pick them up

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 10:02pm EDT
but lava and cacuts destroy dropped items

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 10:02pm EDT
cactus*

Steph DudakFriday, July 29, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT
cacti destroyes stuff..?

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 10:09pm EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 10:09pm EDT
very useful for making traps though

Steph DudakFriday, July 29, 2011 at 10:11pm EDT
yayay cactus traps!

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 10:11pm EDT
I love making traps

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 10:12pm EDT
someone steps on a pressure pad

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 10:12pm EDT
casuing the block beneath them to drop

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 10:13pm EDT
then the blocks surrounding them block off an exit

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 10:13pm EDT
and lava falls from ceiling

No oven/stove/toaster oven?

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
it would also taste a lot better

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT

Steph DudakFriday, July 29, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
Haha too lazy. My life. I like food that can be ready in 2 minutes

Nick DevlinFriday, July 29, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
I usually cook real food instead of microwaves, but there's lots of leftovers I need to eat.
