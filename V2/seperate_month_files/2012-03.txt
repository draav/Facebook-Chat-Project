Pixels lol I feel like itd be a tedious project

Steph DudakThursday, March 8, 2012 at 8:05pm EST
Like stippling

Nick DevlinThursday, March 8, 2012 at 8:06pm EST
Very. I wouldn't have the patience

Nick DevlinThursday, March 8, 2012 at 8:07pm EST
Stippling is better than crosshatching though. I never could do crosshatching

Steph DudakThursday, March 8, 2012 at 8:11pm EST
True story. I hate cross hatching probably cause I'm no good at it and or I just learned how to properly do it this year

Nick DevlinThursday, March 8, 2012 at 9:41pm EST
You actually learned how to do it?!

Nick DevlinThursday, March 8, 2012 at 9:41pm EST
You gotta teach me one day

Nick DevlinThursday, March 8, 2012 at 9:41pm EST
I've never had it explained

Nick DevlinThursday, March 8, 2012 at 9:41pm EST
besides shading with lines

Steph DudakThursday, March 8, 2012 at 9:41pm EST
the week i was in mrs k's class

Steph DudakThursday, March 8, 2012 at 9:41pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, March 8, 2012 at 9:42pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, March 8, 2012 at 9:42pm EST
mhm

Steph DudakThursday, March 8, 2012 at 9:42pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, March 8, 2012 at 9:44pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, March 8, 2012 at 9:44pm EST
you need to explain it to me one day

Nick DevlinThursday, March 8, 2012 at 9:45pm EST
I really want to learn, but not from online

Steph DudakThursday, March 8, 2012 at 9:45pm EST
they're kinda like perpendicular lines

Steph DudakThursday, March 8, 2012 at 9:45pm EST
that's why a lot of times when people crosshatch incorrectly they think of it just as making like x's and stuff yaknow

Steph DudakThursday, March 8, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
it's kinda like perpendicular lines, different spaces, and can overlap and intersect sometimes

Nick DevlinThursday, March 8, 2012 at 9:47pm EST
interesting

Steph DudakSaturday, March 10, 2012 at 8:39pm EST
NICHOLAS I AM SO MAD

“Don't live like there's no tomorrow. Live your life like it's a story you want to tell someone else.” This quote from Philip DeFranco is one of my favorite quotations because it describes perfectly how I feel life should be lived. I want to be able to say I’ve done something with my life. One of the best ways to describe someone is to tell a story about them, and if there is no story to tell, then there is not much to know about that person. I do not want to be a person without a story. I want to be able to say I made an impact and have affected things around me. I go to as many activities as possible, and assist them with whatever they need. I am able to be a regular member of many organizations like the Debate Team, Strategy club, and Math League, with more active roles in Ping Pong, and Asian Heritage club as well. I created the Juggling club because I love to juggle and really want to teach as many people as possible how to juggle, because it is such a simple and interesting talent to have. The more serious activities I am involved with include being part of the Chess Team and a member of the Color Guard, both of which can take over 10 hours every week. They seem to have a contradictory nature in being both very individual sports that force you to pay attention to your personal responsibilities while playing, but still focus on being a part of a team and working together. One of the biggest reasons I’m involved with so many things in School is because I like helping people do things. I almost always do a better job on projects when I am helping someone else as opposed to doing my own work. I enjoy volunteering with events for my church, or school, and especially at the library. At the library I often attend events and occasionally volunteer with things such as SAIL and Reading Buddies, during the summer. But one of the best ways I have been able to find ways to volunteer is the youth group I have been a part of since I moved to Toms River in 2nd grade. I constantly receive opportunities to volunteer from being a part of youth group. I’ve helped serve food at soup kitchens, organize food drives, clean up and set up for services, and have taken care of children at Vacation Bible School. this summer I will be going to New Orleans in order to help rebuild.

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 13, 2012 at 9:26pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, March 13, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
i'll look at that in a sec

Steph DudakTuesday, March 13, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
does the word club need to be capitalized? i noticed you capitalized Team and League but not the clubs. They seem to have a contradictory nature in being both very individual sports that.... I don't like the wording there. in being both idk it sounds weird to me. school should not be capitalized in the last paragraph, first sentence. I enjoy volunteering with events for my church, or school, and especially at the library. no comma after church should be and instead of or, you do both. just take out or actually. church, school, and especially... Bible School. this summer I will be going to This* capitalize

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 13, 2012 at 9:43pm EDT

I have to go over circles mainly. I think I pretty much have ellipses down cause we've been doin that all week

Steph DudakThursday, March 15, 2012 at 9:03pm EDT
But It feels like forever since I've done circles

Nick DevlinThursday, March 15, 2012 at 9:05pm EDT
what's new that you are learning about circles?

Steph DudakThursday, March 15, 2012 at 9:07pm EDT
It's equations of circles and garbage. Like. Write an equation of a circle with center (-4,2) r=radical7 Pts (8,0) & (0,6) are end pts of the diameter. There's ones with tangent and y intercepts. Then there's systems and then there's ones where you need to give the center and radius

Steph DudakThursday, March 15, 2012 at 9:07pm EDT
Prove things like the midpoint of AB is perpendicular to AB

Nick DevlinThursday, March 15, 2012 at 9:08pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 5:03pm EDT
". I woke up early today to attend a Lip Dub (a style of music video) that my school’s Television Production class is producing. I was there to help set up and clean up, along with juggling in parts of the video. After we finished cleaning, I went to the library to shoot a video for that same TV production class about Youth Art Month that will display all the projects made by students, including a portrait I painted. "

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 5:03pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 8:43pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 8:43pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 8:44pm EDT
while you're picture taking

Steph DudakSunday, March 18, 2012 at 8:44pm EDT
what

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 8:44pm EDT
I googled your question about the island to see if it was some thing online

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 8:45pm EDT
the top two hits were about zelda

Steph DudakSunday, March 18, 2012 at 8:46pm EDT
Oh. No I was asking because I'm in the middle of drawing my floating island thing and only had a tree so I wanted inspiration You and the three other people I asked all have boring answers though so I'm gonna out a cool door on it

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 8:47pm EDT
ohhh

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 8:47pm EDT
you shouldve said that!

Steph DudakSunday, March 18, 2012 at 8:47pm EDT
Hope you can see. Ignore the inside but this is what I have drawn so far

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 8:47pm EDT
yeah that's what i though

Steph DudakSunday, March 18, 2012 at 8:47pm EDT
I said what would you picture lol not hey pull it from something youve seen :p

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 8:52pm EDT
if i climbed up a rope ladder...no i'd still say a tree

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 8:52pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 8:55pm EDT
metal edging

Steph DudakSunday, March 18, 2012 at 8:57pm EDT
Yes

Steph DudakSunday, March 18, 2012 at 8:58pm EDT
So the inside of that will be all wood tree blahblahblah

Steph DudakSunday, March 18, 2012 at 8:58pm EDT
And some sort of crest that I need to think up

Steph DudakSunday, March 18, 2012 at 8:58pm EDT
Which will be green

Steph DudakSunday, March 18, 2012 at 8:58pm EDT
I'm gonna need to buy new green colored pencils cause I'm gonna be using green a lot

Steph DudakSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:00pm EDT
Might change the door shape or make the door even bigger idk

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:02pm EDT
that's just the idea paper right?

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:05pm EDT
what are the rays coming from the left side?

Steph DudakSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:07pm EDT
They're gonna be shades of green Probably some sort of designs For no purpose other than to look pretty I might make the island in pencil and then have those rays and the doors be in color

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:07pm EDT
that works

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:07pm EDT
and is that a bush? or a tree?

Steph DudakSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:08pm EDT
It's a tree that I'm fixing as I'm typing this

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:09pm EDT
funfun

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:09pm EDT
i was going to mention

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:09pm EDT
that it's a tad stumpy

Steph DudakSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:10pm EDT
It is lol

Steph DudakSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:10pm EDT
It might look a little better now hold on

Steph DudakSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:10pm EDT
Might need to fix it a bit again

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:11pm EDT
so this the actually piece you will be drawing on and everything

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:11pm EDT
?

Steph DudakSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:12pm EDT
Yeah cause Idw redraw everything Did you have a suggestion you'd like to make about it

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:13pm EDT
the door

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:13pm EDT
too pointy

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:13pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:13pm EDT
that i cant see yet

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:13pm EDT
but right now

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:13pm EDT
meh

Steph DudakSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:13pm EDT
I'm fixing that too actually lol I don't like the shape

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:14pm EDT
you'll obviously be detailing the island and stairs with shading and whatnot

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:14pm EDT
so that's fine

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:14pm EDT
a question though

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:14pm EDT
are those stairs cut into the island

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:15pm EDT
or are they jutting out?

Steph DudakSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:17pm EDT
They're like out. You'd be able to step on them. You know if they were shaped right. I need to fix the angle most of the steps are at though. They should be getting wider as they go from bottom to top Know what I mean I drew it without thinking about it

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:18pm EDT
i know what you mean

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:18pm EDT
grr

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:18pm EDT
how to explain

Steph DudakSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:18pm EDT
Some of these middle branches have to not start so low I think but I think it's a little better than it was before

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:19pm EDT
it looks a little better

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:19pm EDT
what kind of tree is it?

Nick DevlinSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:19pm EDT
it looks sorta like the methusalah tree

Steph DudakSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:20pm EDT
It's just a tree

Steph DudakSunday, March 18, 2012 at 9:20pm EDT
Idk I just drew it lol

Nick DevlinMonday, March 19, 2012 at 9:51pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, March 19, 2012 at 9:53pm EDT
Yeah I had Drew check his car again, apparently it's not in there. Hopefully I left it in Schindlers otherwise I left it in the media center or It dropped outside and I was unaware and no one told me. I hope that didn't happen

Nick DevlinMonday, March 19, 2012 at 10:41pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, March 20, 2012 at 7:30pm EDT
So what are the odds that How we want to see things vs how they actually are / coexistence of reality and fantasy Would be an appropriate concentration

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 20, 2012 at 9:03pm EDT
50/50 talk to her when shes in a good mood and you have multiple projects completed

Steph DudakTuesday, March 20, 2012 at 9:05pm EDT
I have to talk to her ASAP. I dont have time for that bc I it ends up its not, then I'll need to start over and I'll have an excess of breadth pieces.

Steph DudakTuesday, March 20, 2012 at 9:05pm EDT
I have ideas and I can use some things I already have. Well more of the later things im working on. They fit together in my head but that's the problem.

Steph DudakTuesday, March 20, 2012 at 9:05pm EDT
Everything makes sense in my head

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 20, 2012 at 9:06pm EDT
Good luck with that.

Steph DudakTuesday, March 20, 2012 at 9:06pm EDT
Thaaanks

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 20, 2012 at 9:07pm EDT
If you need me to tell you what wont make sense I'll have no problems criticising

Steph DudakTuesday, March 20, 2012 at 9:09pm EDT
I appreciate that. Can I go over it with you during lunch tomorrow if she for once okays something I want to do?

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 20, 2012 at 9:10pm EDT

Quick question

Steph DudakTuesday, March 20, 2012 at 9:20pm EDT
Ask away

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 20, 2012 at 9:20pm EDT
What do you do in art class?

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 20, 2012 at 9:20pm EDT
Like the actual period? Just around

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 20, 2012 at 9:20pm EDT
Or talk about art or learn new mediums?

Steph DudakTuesday, March 20, 2012 at 9:22pm EDT
Work on art Watch mrs Calicchio and dishon mess with each other Calicch will mention random things sometimes That's really it. We barely talk to each other all of us. Like generally, we're pretty quiet. Jess does nothing ever though

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 20, 2012 at 9:23pm EDT
Jmm thought it was something like that

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 20, 2012 at 9:23pm EDT
Alright thanks

Steph DudakTuesday, March 20, 2012 at 9:25pm EDT
No problem

Nick DevlinWednesday, March 21, 2012 at 11:48pm EDT
I tend to help out whenever possible. You never know what small things can lead to a big change. Something as insignificant as waiting 3 extra seconds to hold the door for someone behind you can make that person’s entire day. Just the idea that 3 seconds can influence an entire day is astounding. Imagine the changes that could be made by spending hour or weeks dedicated to a particular cause or event. bleepity bloop blorp blughenstein wtf with all the b alliterations? weird shit man what time is it? 11:44? how the fuck is it not even midnight. didn’t i used to stay up till like 2 am back in the day? oh right that was before i woke up at like 5am every morning. maybe if elephants could train my homework its do itself better then me cuz i cant at all whatd happen if i turned this in/? haha theyd just send me me to the snake oit under one of there desks i know its there so many typos even my ramble i feel the urge to correct fuck i ll use whatever their i want whenever i want screw the purple line FIGHT THE MOARCHY OF COLORED UNDERLINES

Nick DevlinWednesday, March 21, 2012 at 11:48pm EDT
I'm going certifiably insane. Do you think if i show this to my teacher's they will let me out of school for a wekk to just sleep 24/7

Nick DevlinWednesday, March 21, 2012 at 11:48pm EDT
ugh

If I'm feeling fancy I'll wear the one dress I own

Steph DudakWednesday, March 21, 2012 at 11:58pm EDT
Otherwise it's that purple and black shirt with a pair of boots and some sort of nice looking pants or something. Which is actually what mother nature suggested.

Steph DudakWednesday, March 21, 2012 at 11:58pm EDT
"I don't care wear whatever you want. You could wear that black and purple shirt you like and a pair of boots or something you know." Rambling

Nick DevlinWednesday, March 21, 2012 at 11:59pm EDT

ive been trying to get my world affairs project completely together since 10:30 this morning

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 1:38pm EDT
i finally got it to export out of keynote and import into imovie properly and guess what?

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 1:38pm EDT
my project was 13 minutes long

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 1:38pm EDT
so now, i gotta go back and fix it because if i leave it, i'll get marked a grade down for it being over 10 minutes.

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 2:51pm EDT
your life sucks

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 2:51pm EDT
a lot

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 3:41pm EDT
Yep

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 4:54pm EDT
at least we agree

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 4:55pm EDT
what did you remove, or did you shorten the clips

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 4:56pm EDT
I removed one thing from history that was pretty insignificant and I made the transitions 1.5 sec instead of the 2 it was at and made sure pretty much every slide was 7 sec

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 4:57pm EDT
I shortened it to 11:23

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 4:57pm EDT
...

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 4:57pm EDT
so another minute still?

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 4:57pm EDT
That's as good as its getting. It's only a minute over so if he takes a grade off for that he can go fuck himself

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 4:57pm EDT
It's already on the DVD

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 4:58pm EDT
i like that way better

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 4:58pm EDT
I spent 6 hours importing and exporting over and over

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 4:58pm EDT
I wasn't about to do it a 6th time

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 4:58pm EDT

And I'll do the other two squiggly things like the bottom ones

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 8:33pm EDT
i think that works

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 8:34pm EDT
did you think about using like different techniques?

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 8:34pm EDT
stippling

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 8:34pm EDT
Not sure what they are exactlly I just think they look cool

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 8:34pm EDT
Well I want them all to be done the same way

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 8:34pm EDT
!!!!!

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 8:34pm EDT
STIPPLING

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 8:35pm EDT
Shit that'll take forever

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 8:35pm EDT
But

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 8:35pm EDT
i thgink it'd look cool

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 8:35pm EDT
In there Could be a normal thing

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 8:35pm EDT
Done up not normal

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 8:36pm EDT
restate

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 8:36pm EDT
don't understand

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 8:36pm EDT
I could do some sort of plain thing inside that bubble and stipple the whole thing

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 8:36pm EDT
Instead of actually drawing something

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 8:36pm EDT
ahhh

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 8:36pm EDT
Or

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 8:37pm EDT
understanding

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 8:37pm EDT
Do something using geometric shapes

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 8:39pm EDT
Or something

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 8:41pm EDT
that works

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:08pm EDT
why have you not read othello nicholas

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:08pm EDT
why

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:08pm EDT
because I am not entirely insane

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:08pm EDT
i saw sassy gay friend version though

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:08pm EDT
and coded the game othello

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:08pm EDT
if those help

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:09pm EDT
uhhhh probably not

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:09pm EDT
i'm writing a paper on theme development

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:09pm EDT
hmm

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:09pm EDT
yeah

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
i don't think i'll be able to assist you

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
neither can morgan apparently

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
i wrote an outline right

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
and idk we need like TECHNIQUES for theme development

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
one of the themes i wrote about was pride

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
she wrote nice!! next to it

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
and at the end

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:11pm EDT
(his death and his murder of Desdemona (and other deaths as well.) and no longer the "honorable" death of military victory for the state - now fueled by self-interest!)(an interesting idea...)

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:11pm EDT
with a giant

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:11pm EDT
techniques-? but sensitive reading! :)

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:11pm EDT
next to it

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:12pm EDT
the parentheses stuff is what she wrote after one of my notes that said 2. Diminishing pride throughout play leads to death

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:14pm EDT
what does techniques mean?

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:14pm EDT
irony diction and stuff?

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:14pm EDT
ready this is my paper so far

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:14pm EDT
i'm scared

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:15pm EDT
oh it's so bad too

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:15pm EDT
any grammatical suggestions are greatly appreciated

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:15pm EDT
btw

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:15pm EDT
no prob

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:15pm EDT
Many techniques are used to develop multiple themes in Shakespeare’s “Othello.” Two major themes that are developed are appearance vs reality and pride. Appearance vs reality is one of the major themes of Othello and is most apparently shwon by the characters of Iago and Desdemona through Shakespeare’s use of irony. Throughout Othello, nearly every character refers to Iago as “honest.” The word itself is used very often in the play, especially as Iago’s actions worsen, but is used ironically. Iago, as the audience knows, is anything but honest and focuses on trying to ruin the lives of all the characters -- mainly Othello. He is only honest when he is alone. However, in scene one of act one, Iago says to Rodeigo “I am not what I am,” which provides foreshadowing as well as it being one of the very few times he actually is being honest around other people. The theme of appearance vs reality is first introduced here as Iago admits to being the exact opposite of what he appears to be. Desdemona is another character through which the theme is developed. So much time is spent throughout the play to build up Desdemona’s appearance as innocent, pure, beautiful, and basically perfect. This changes once Iago falsely tells Othello that Desdemona has been cheating on him with Cassio because it leads Othello to believe that Desdemona is suddenly the opposite of everything he believed her to be -- everything she was described as up until this point. This situation is ironic as well because Desdemona’s purity and honesty is not just an appearance. Everything she has been described as is exactly how she is as a person. However, Iago is the one that is truly dishonest and deceitful and should be placed in the position Desdemona is in; that is, Iago should be the one that Othello wants to get rid of. Because Othello believes in the way everything appears to be, he sets himself and the other characters up for disaster. His belief that Iago is “honest” and Desdemona is the opposite of everything he has thought her to be leads him to have Cassio and Desdemona killed. It is only after Othello kills Desdemona that he finds out she had been honest all along and Iago had been lying the entire time, resulting in Othello killing himself for what he has done. The irony here is that as far as we know, Iago is only arrested at the end of the play-- it is unclear what actually happens to him. This could be seen as Iago getting off with a warning or as the villain getting away. Another important theme developed throughout Othello is a theme of pride, which is primarily shown in Othello himself because it is also his tragic flaw. that giant space, is to be continued space. idk how to end that stuff about iago.

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:16pm EDT
vs has a period after it

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:17pm EDT
first sentence

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:17pm EDT
"are use to develop *the many* themes ..."

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:18pm EDT
multiple is weird

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:18pm EDT
see

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:18pm EDT
i avoided many

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:18pm EDT
because many is the first word lol

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:18pm EDT
i felt redundant

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:20pm EDT
oh didn't notice that

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:20pm EDT
just take out multiple ?

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:20pm EDT
"there are multiple techniques used to develop the many themes

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:20pm EDT
yeah

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:20pm EDT
that's silly

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:21pm EDT
just takes out the adjetive to descreibe how many

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:21pm EDT
Many techniques are used to develop themes of appearance vs. reality and pride in Shakespeare’s “Othello.”

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:21pm EDT
yes

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:23pm EDT
shown is spelled wrong

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:24pm EDT
omg not even

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:24pm EDT
schwon

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:24pm EDT
did i write that

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:25pm EDT
mhmm

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:25pm EDT
i don't feel that there is much more to say about iago

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:26pm EDT
i just feels like it ends weirdly

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:26pm EDT
i mean you have proven quite cleary his connection to your theme

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:26pm EDT
wasn't sure if i could get away with leaving it just like that or not

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:27pm EDT
found the incorrectly spelled shown

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:33pm EDT
meh i think it's fine

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:34pm EDT
"However, Iago is the one that is truly dishonest and deceitful and should be placed in the position Desdemona is in; that is, Iago should be the one that Othello wants to get rid of."

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:34pm EDT
that

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:34pm EDT
so awkwardly phrased

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:34pm EDT
i mean it makes sense

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:34pm EDT
but yeah you could explain it better

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:35pm EDT
probably

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:37pm EDT
uh

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:37pm EDT
hm

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:37pm EDT
?

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:37pm EDT
trynna figure how to word it properly

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:39pm EDT
"It is only after Othello kills Desdemona that he finds out *that* she had been honest all along and *that* Iago had been lying the entire time, *which results* in Othello killing himself for what he has done. "

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:39pm EDT
i don't know why the *that*s need to be everywhere but it sounds empty without them

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:40pm EDT
i hope they actually have to be there then

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:40pm EDT
and i had which results written on my paper so idk why i wrote resulting lol

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:40pm EDT
who knows

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:41pm EDT
i think you need a transition between your two points

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:41pm EDT
of pride and appearance

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:41pm EDT
I'm thinking you can realte Othello's pride

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:41pm EDT
i'm awful at transitions generally

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:41pm EDT
relate*

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:41pm EDT
it can be

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:41pm EDT
to appeareance

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:41pm EDT
related

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:41pm EDT
pretend that was one coherent sentence

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:41pm EDT
there i go talking like yoda

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:41pm EDT
anywho

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:45pm EDT
Here

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:45pm EDT
best i got

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:45pm EDT
"A closely intertwined theme developed throughout this play is the pride shown by Othello which causes his faith in the facades of those around him. This pride becomes his tragic flaw…"

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:45pm EDT
or something

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:45pm EDT
edit it to actually make sense to someone who has read the book

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:46pm EDT
yeah bc his pride links with him wanting to look powerful which is extremely important to him and in an attempt to keep that he fucks everything up

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:46pm EDT
exactly

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:46pm EDT
but that's an excellent transition nicholas

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:46pm EDT
why thank you!

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:46pm EDT
you should help me with those more often cause i suck at them

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:46pm EDT
a lot

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:46pm EDT
i never use them in my own work

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:47pm EDT
i can only write them for other people

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:47pm EDT
its highly irritating

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:47pm EDT
but they are fun to make

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:47pm EDT
so anytime you need help

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:47pm EDT
just ask

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:49pm EDT
what's a more sophisticated way to say

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:49pm EDT
as the play goes out or you know as the play plays out

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:49pm EDT
the second just sounds dumb

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:50pm EDT
throughout the course of the play

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:50pm EDT
umm

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:50pm EDT
idk give me the entire sentence with the stupid phrase so i can use context

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:51pm EDT
[Othello is very proud of himself and his achievements, which becomes more obvious blahblahblahblahblah] something like this

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:51pm EDT
because

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:51pm EDT
okay no let me explain first

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:52pm EDT
in the beginning, othello is very well spoken and is um... there's a word for it. he doesn't put himself down, but he like downplays himself as a person. he's modest but that's not what i'm looking for says he's rude in his speech and blahblah when really he speaks eloquently and smoothly and respectfully and. he's just great at talking. which eventually deteriorates too as iago fucks with his head and he's ready to kill desdemona. passion overrides his ability to talk and he becomes a man of action instead of word

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:52pm EDT
s

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:53pm EDT
mkay

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:53pm EDT
Othellos is more humble in the beginning?

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:54pm EDT
yeah basically

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:54pm EDT
like

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:54pm EDT
he still is aware of his achievements

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:54pm EDT
and points out how all he really knows is war and junk

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:54pm EDT
i understand

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:54pm EDT
i mean he's never really like

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:54pm EDT
oh ho ho look at me

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:55pm EDT
but as it plays out, what happens with him and desdemona hurts his pride, so he feels like now he has to show that well i am a man and i'm powerful and no one fucks with this nigga

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:55pm EDT
gotcha

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:57pm EDT
either way it has to fit somewhere after that transition

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:57pm EDT
At the start of the play Othello's attitude is one of a man who is self-assured in himself, but not one to boast of his talents and acheivements. Throughout the course of the play his bruised ego cause him to lapse into a much baser character that feels it necessary to display his strength in order to reassure himself of his skill.

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:58pm EDT
minor errors in that statement but it is along those lines

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:58pm EDT
you are fabulous

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:58pm EDT
i know

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 10:59pm EDT
baser tho

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:00pm EDT
base2 [beys] bas·er, bas·est, noun adjective 1. morally low; without estimable personal qualities; dishonorable; meanspirited; selfish; cowardly.

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:00pm EDT
yeah baser

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:00pm EDT
synonyms

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:01pm EDT
it was the best word i could think of the means less of a good person

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:01pm EDT
but not a complete dick

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:01pm EDT
then again he killed his wife

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:01pm EDT
i don't have as wide a vocabulary as you do nicholas lol. there's quite some difference between how i write and how you write i'll use it

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:02pm EDT
say you used a thesaurus

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:02pm EDT
which technically i might as well be

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:02pm EDT
so it won't be a complete lie

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:02pm EDT
the only unfortunate thing about this

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:02pm EDT
is i'm not talking about any sort of technique

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:03pm EDT
idk any techniques used to develop this theme. it's just obvious that it's developed

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:03pm EDT
i wish i could write that

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:04pm EDT
list techniques

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:04pm EDT
idk what any are

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:05pm EDT
idk but she noted on the appearance one "Theme development techniques here- diction, irony?"

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:05pm EDT
and circled like the whole iago thing

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:05pm EDT
well you mention irony often

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:05pm EDT
and diction i'm guessing you could just mention how Othello speaks differently in the beginning and his speech patterns change

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:06pm EDT
hmm i might be able to do that

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:06pm EDT
once again have to pick out the dumb one liners he uses

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:06pm EDT
O monstrous! O monstrous!

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:06pm EDT
exactly

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:07pm EDT
O blood, blood, blood!

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:08pm EDT
Death and damnation, O! god shut up othello i hate this

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:08pm EDT
, = !

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:08pm EDT
commas are exclamation points?

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:08pm EDT
I'll tear her all to pieces

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:09pm EDT
the comma i put in that last one

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:09pm EDT
was supposed to be an exclamation point

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:09pm EDT
Death and damnation! O!

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:09pm EDT
O!thello is retarded

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:10pm EDT
i

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:10pm EDT
will allow

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:10pm EDT
this one time

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:10pm EDT
lol

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:10pm EDT
because i actually did

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:10pm EDT
hahahaha yesss

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:10pm EDT
ugh i feel dirty saying that

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:10pm EDT
LOL

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:10pm EDT
sorry

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:10pm EDT
it's okay

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:11pm EDT
it's okay

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:11pm EDT
i will make it

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:13pm EDT
hmm

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:13pm EDT
i just realized that i kind of like writing essays

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:13pm EDT
not formal ones

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:13pm EDT
but

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:13pm EDT
informal essays are pretty much just books

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:14pm EDT
i think i'll need to start writing more

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:14pm EDT
i cannot stand how everything othello omg like it's all bc iago tells him desdemona has been cheating on him with cassio

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:14pm EDT
othello suddenly becomes an idiot

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:14pm EDT
iago's talking to him and othello's like naaaah my wife's perfect and pure and wonderful and SHE picked ME yo

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:14pm EDT
and then he's like

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:14pm EDT
making the character change to fit the plot

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:14pm EDT
basic laziness

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:14pm EDT
ffffffffff her handkerchief was in cassio's room

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:17pm EDT
explaining plays like that

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:17pm EDT
makes them feel more relatable which sounds absolutely stupid

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
no

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
it doesn't

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
but its not

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
that's how literature works

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
i should rewrite othello

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
ACTUALLY

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
LOL

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
in some form or anothe

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
where it was like "What was said" in othello and what it means

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
r

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
mhmm

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:19pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:19pm EDT
it was awesome

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:19pm EDT
i like those things

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:20pm EDT
I wish our school's AP classes were like real AP

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:21pm EDT
so i could actually take them and not be afraid that my teacher's disorganization and annoying way of teaching would ruin my grades

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:21pm EDT
i don't know what real AP is

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:21pm EDT
i have a feeling i should be failing morgans

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:21pm EDT
but i get straight As

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:21pm EDT
somehow

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:23pm EDT
i have this misinterpreted dreamland version of ap

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:23pm EDT
where it's like a challenging class

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:23pm EDT
without much homework because it's mostly done in class

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:23pm EDT
and there isn't busy work

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:24pm EDT
oh yeah that thing

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:24pm EDT
but actually interesting topics

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:24pm EDT
i've heard of that once

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:24pm EDT
i've never experienced it

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:24pm EDT
yeah i was close

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:24pm EDT
marotto's class

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:24pm EDT
was good for that

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:25pm EDT
i learned most of my math from her

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:25pm EDT
because she knew how to teach

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:25pm EDT
i actually think she was like my best teacher

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:25pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:29pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:29pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, March 25, 2012 at 11:29pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, March 28, 2012 at 9:52pm EDT
cous is supposed to be like cshortened cousin because some people say it like they would say bro

Nick DevlinWednesday, March 28, 2012 at 9:53pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, March 28, 2012 at 9:53pm EDT

I just spent 3 days convincing her that her excitement about The Fault in Our Stars was misplaced

Nick DevlinWednesday, March 28, 2012 at 11:27pm EDT
and that it would make a terrible movie

Nick DevlinWednesday, March 28, 2012 at 11:27pm EDT
apparently she took it to heart

Nick DevlinWednesday, March 28, 2012 at 11:27pm EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, March 28, 2012 at 11:30pm EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, March 28, 2012 at 11:30pm EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, March 28, 2012 at 11:34pm EDT
She makes it sound like the producers of twilight will ruin it

Steph DudakWednesday, March 28, 2012 at 11:34pm EDT
First of all

Steph DudakWednesday, March 28, 2012 at 11:34pm EDT
Invalid argument

Steph DudakWednesday, March 28, 2012 at 11:35pm EDT
The twilight movies are based off the books. And they're actually pretty good representations of them even though the whole franchise as a whole kind of sucks

Nick DevlinWednesday, March 28, 2012 at 11:35pm EDT
polish a turd

Nick DevlinWednesday, March 28, 2012 at 11:35pm EDT
still a turd

Nick DevlinWednesday, March 28, 2012 at 11:35pm EDT
the tried their best

Steph DudakWednesday, March 28, 2012 at 11:35pm EDT
Stephanie Meyer came up with the whole sparkly vampires and whatever the fuck. She put it in writing, someone just made it so you can see it

Steph DudakWednesday, March 28, 2012 at 11:36pm EDT
It's not that they turned this awesome book into some weird awful horrible thing

Nick DevlinWednesday, March 28, 2012 at 11:37pm EDT
I finally used acquiesce in a sentence :)

Steph DudakWednesday, March 28, 2012 at 11:40pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, March 28, 2012 at 11:41pm EDT
