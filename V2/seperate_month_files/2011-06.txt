Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:49pm EDT
i should really try responding more often than every hourt

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:49pm EDT
and how? you already know what its like shouldnt it be easier?

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:49pm EDT

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:49pm EDT
oh look i responded within a minute!

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:50pm EDT
i deserve a medal

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:50pm EDT
yeah you do

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:51pm EDT

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:51pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:51pm EDT
yeah. i walked into my bathroom, my phone fell outta my sweatshirt pocket and fell into the toilet. and it's now sitting in a bag of rice

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:51pm EDT
in hopes that it'll work tomorrow

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:51pm EDT
but probably not

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:51pm EDT
with my luck

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:51pm EDT
since it fell in the first place

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:51pm EDT
...awesome

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:51pm EDT

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
8D

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
right after getting home from sats

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
i was so angry

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
but you forgot how much SATs suck right?

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
not at all

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
oh well

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
it was like

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
got home from g's. my thought process was this:

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:55pm EDT
"Man SATs suck. Now I gotta get started on those three packets. Womp." *walks into bathroom and phone falls* "FUCKING JEW ARE YOU KIDDING ME." *speaks aloud* "THIS IS NOT FUCKING HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. MY FUCKING PHONE ARE YOU KIDDING." meanwhile no ones home *thinks again* "My phones probably broken. I probably did worse on these SATs than the last, and I still have to do those mother fucking packets."

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:55pm EDT
wow your memory is awesome

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:55pm EDT
but the memories themseles suck

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
yeah well that was generally what happened

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
and yes indeed

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
well i am babysitting now

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:57pm EDT
uuh

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:57pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:57pm EDT
sounds terrible

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:57pm EDT
wanna know whats worse?

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
i was home alone all day

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
and instead of doing stuff

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
i cleaned the house

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
for no reason

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
...

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
at least everything's clean now

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
i've been wasting time

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
and procrastinating those packets

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
i did work on them a little bit. but 100 math problems for a final review when i'm exempt is not really my cup of tea

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:59pm EDT
nor is that chem packet

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:59pm EDT
nor is the other algebra packet review that's for my test next week

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:59pm EDT
4 full days of school left. what is this, nicholas?

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 8:59pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:00pm EDT
XD

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:00pm EDT

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:04pm EDT
I know! I just make programs that work and ignore whatever she's talking about

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:04pm EDT
Then she's all like, how'd you do that?

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:04pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:07pm EDT
etc etc

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:07pm EDT
yep, school server was down on thursday

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:08pm EDT
further attempt was futile. it was awful.

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:08pm EDT
school computers suck

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:08pm EDT
basically

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:08pm EDT
all ours dont work since they ran out of memory

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:08pm EDT
we have to delete all of our projects now

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:08pm EDT
D:

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:09pm EDT
I know, that program that finds out if a number is odd or even was my favorite!

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:09pm EDT
i bet it was

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:10pm EDT
basically next year i will have no hair

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:10pm EDT
it will all be pulled out

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:10pm EDT
since i have like 5 computer classes

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:11pm EDT
FIVE

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:11pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:13pm EDT
it's easy though

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:13pm EDT
sure?

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:14pm EDT
i don't see why you wouldn't do it. but it's easy

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:14pm EDT

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:14pm EDT
what do you have all english and art right?

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:15pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:15pm EDT
and then architecture

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:15pm EDT
so i guess you can consider that 3 art classes technically

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:16pm EDT
yeah. that'll be fun. full schedule.

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:16pm EDT

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:33pm EDT
you just disappeared, then respoded, and you've gone again!

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:34pm EDT
internet

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:34pm EDT
and technology

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:34pm EDT
is not working in my favor today

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:34pm EDT
i don't know why

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:34pm EDT
but it is not

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:34pm EDT
it seems that way

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT
i think it's good now lol

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT
safari decided it wasn't gonna let me do anything

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT
firefox decided the same.

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT
opera was nice enough to let me get on facebook.

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT
and now everythings working again

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT
how many browser's you have?!

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT
just those three lol

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
cool your jets

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
no need to yell

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
i just use chrome

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
why so many?

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
i only use safari

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
those are just if i need to use a different browser for whatever reason

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
well my mom had me dl firefox because

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
she's got some toolbar on there for one of her dumb fb games so

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
opera's just cause i always have opera downloaded idk. as a backup lol. i don't like firefox. but i prefer safari over all. hence why i only use that. and opera in emergency situations

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
yaknow

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
it all makes sense now

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
although i have a feeling that that was a sign that i should get off my ass and do some homework because tomorrow is sunday

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
buut what are the odds that that will happen?

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
slim to none, about a 27.5% chance

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
better than the odds of me doing that

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
probably lol

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
i should bring it down here. multitask

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
good idea

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
thats what i've been doing

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
google is nice with these comp questions

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:40pm EDT
haha win

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:40pm EDT
so i'm one step closer.

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:40pm EDT
my books are beside me

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:41pm EDT
the next task is to actually open em up

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:41pm EDT
you can do it!

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:41pm EDT
i realized that i forget like. everything relating to math. omg i was doing the final review and had to use my book for so much of it.

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:41pm EDT
cool right?

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:42pm EDT
i feel like i learned none of it

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:42pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:42pm EDT

Use the given point on the terminal side of an angle ø (thats what it looks like but thats not it) in standard position to evaluate the six trigonometric functions of ø. 1. (8, -15)

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:46pm EDT
draw the graph

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:46pm EDT
plot the point

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:47pm EDT
make a vertical line to x-axis

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:47pm EDT
ø is the angle connecting to origin

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:47pm EDT
ooooooooooooooooo

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:47pm EDT
that thing

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 9:47pm EDT

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
then use the 3 side lengths to find each angle with socahtoa

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
so that's what the question is asking?

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
i just confused myself so bad

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
ok so

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:01pm EDT
wait

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:01pm EDT
where is ø on that lovely little picture?

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:01pm EDT
wait a sec

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:02pm EDT
oook

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:02pm EDT
http://i551.photobucket.com/albums/ii472/dravarian26/homework.png

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:03pm EDT
why did you label those a o & h?

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:03pm EDT
those are the sides, opposite theta, adjecent, and the hypotenuse

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:03pm EDT
o

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:03pm EDT
duh

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:03pm EDT
in order to find sin, and cos, and tan

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT
OMG. DUH. OKAY.

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT
i got it =

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT
ignore that equal sign

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT
i will

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:05pm EDT
i forgot that sinø, etc even like existed and like. whatever doesn't matter

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:05pm EDT
thank you lol

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:05pm EDT
no problem

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:07pm EDT
i dont think im allowed to have decimal answers

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:08pm EDT
just leave it as radical then

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:08pm EDT
well

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:08pm EDT
i didn't have a radical to begin wit

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:08pm EDT
h

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:08pm EDT
so.

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:08pm EDT
oh

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:08pm EDT
then leave as fractions

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:09pm EDT
8, 15, 17 is special right i forgot

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:09pm EDT
is it really

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:09pm EDT
just like 3, 4, 5

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:09pm EDT
i'm totally failing this test

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:09pm EDT
maybe

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:09pm EDT
maybe not

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:09pm EDT
and i actually need all this weird math in life

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:09pm EDT
womp

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:10pm EDT
epecially if you're doing architecture

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:10pm EDT
exactly lol

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:10pm EDT
pssh, who needs safety regulations anyway

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:10pm EDT
just make it look pretty

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:10pm EDT
its ok i have a paper

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:10pm EDT
i'm not sure what this is doing for me

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:10pm EDT
?

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:13pm EDT
i had this sheet

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:13pm EDT
with triangle stuff on it

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:13pm EDT
but i dont have it

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:14pm EDT
now i have this other paper

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:14pm EDT
which is useless

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:14pm EDT
trig ratios and reference angles

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:14pm EDT
which is what you wer just doing in that last problem

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:15pm EDT
how am i supposed to get a radical answer for this

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:17pm EDT
you aren't i just assumed it would conatin a radical

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:17pm EDT
contain*

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:17pm EDT
since using pythagorean theorum usually does that

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:18pm EDT
i cant have a decimal answer though

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
grrr, so hard to explain in chat

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
i need an explanation lol

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
okaythis is still the 8, -15 one right?

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:20pm EDT
yeah

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:22pm EDT
so the sin would be 8/17 , since the hypotenuse is 17 and the opposite angle form theta is 8

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:22pm EDT
yes

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:22pm EDT
no i meant 15!!

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:22pm EDT
sorry

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:22pm EDT
i knw what all that is

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
i know the sin, cos, and tan

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
of all that

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
okay

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
then what?

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
but once i have the fractions..

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
then what?

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
exactly.

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
thats it

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
how

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
and just simplify the fractions then?

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
prettty much

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
oh

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
tyou can use those numbers to do more stuff

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
-.-

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:23pm EDT
but question didn't ask for it

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:24pm EDT
i only need the 6 trigonometric functions lol

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:24pm EDT
you got all the reciprocals right?

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:24pm EDT
yeep

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:24pm EDT
then your done

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:24pm EDT
sin goes with cosecant? cosine = sec, tan = cotan

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:24pm EDT
yep

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
stop overcomplicating

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
you finished problem

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
i know haha

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
question 2

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
my parents just came in here and looked through like all my math garbage

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
and were like

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
what the heck, you know all this?

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
why?

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
what does that even mean?

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
haha

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
you need to have this whole packet done by wednesday? *no not that one that one is due monday*

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
12 pages due monday what

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
omg

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
akgjldshjh

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
mine said that stuff starting around 6th grade

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
yeah

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
v53

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
i dont like sides like that

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
i'm not having fun anymore

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
at least you have memories of fun

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
this is what i've been doing

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
hahaha

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
http://i551.photobucket.com/albums/ii472/dravarian26/nothomework.png

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
hahahaha

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
i like how you named that not homework btw lol

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
what else would it be called

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
i almost called it homework2

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
turn that in to marotto

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
instead of whatever hw you should have done for her

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
lemme know how it goes

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
i do that occasionally

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
i turned in a test and for all the answers i didn't know i just put random facts and pictures

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
oh wow lol

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
she put question marks all over the place

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
she's no fun

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
i should be a teacher

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
nope

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
yes you should

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
just so i can put weird answers for multiple choice questions

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
and when people doodle i can doodle back

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
yeah that'd be awesome

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
there are some that do that

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
but i wouldn't be a teacher so lol

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
i should be a teacher

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
really quick, then you can get back to that

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
if my sin = -2v53/53

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
does that mean my csc = 53/-2v53, and i need to re-rationalize that?

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
yeah right?

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
yes

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
womp

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
okay you can go on with your i should be a teacher story

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
it would be 53v53/-2

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
mutiply -2 by 53 dont you?

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
I would just ramble on about irrelevant topics, then lose everyone's tests mainly

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
because then when you rationalize, that v53 turns into 53

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
don't think so

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
if you have

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
-2v53 on the bottom

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
you have to

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
oh yeah that

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
and you cant just leave it next to the 2

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
sorry

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
that makes me think of mr fowlin

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
he'd talk about english while we were in history

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
yes then it would be 53v53/ 106

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
and math while we were in english

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
correct

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
fowling was awesome

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
negative though

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
YOU MUST HAVE A PERRRIOD

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
we were doing math problems

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
and he taught grammar

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
exactly haha

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:36pm EDT
like what are you doing

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:36pm EDT
he was an interesting person though lol

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:36pm EDT
his eyes creeped meout

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:36pm EDT
does he still sub there?

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
i'll ask my sister tomorrow

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
i just tried asking my brother

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
he decided to log off fb though soo

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:39pm EDT
lmao

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:39pm EDT
aw

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:39pm EDT
always forgot to do homework on mondays

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT
hmm

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT
i am listening to a song about jigglypuff right now

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT
and it is awesome

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT
i'm not lol

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT
i bet it is

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT
you should http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuplUYo33xE&feature=autoplay&list=PL455CB4CADEEE4951&index=10&playnext=3

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT
best album ever

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
so its basically jigglypuff singing

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
oh

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
just kidding

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
nope

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
i didnt hear the words

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
til just now

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
yeah i dont like it lol

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
you have no taste in fine art

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
lolok

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
it almost made me cry

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
so beautiful

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
DX

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:44pm EDT
i'm guessing that is an emoticon saying that you were incorrect and think that the song is amazing?

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:44pm EDT
you are incorrect

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:45pm EDT
aw well

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
wow, i looked at chem packet

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
i can't even guess at these things

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
you need a periodic table for most of it too

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
yeah i lost mine

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
all 5 of the

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
them*

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
good going

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
OH NO

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
use your book

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
OH NO

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
i have a spanish project on monday

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
o

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
better do that

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
i am right now

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
i have to make model of a city from the future

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
i am making it on minecraft

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
commo estas? muy bien! y tu?

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
idk if that's correct spelling

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
that sounds like oodles of fun

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
spelling is close, and it would be fun

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
if i had more than a day to do it

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
you really like having conversations with yourself in other languages by the way

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:50pm EDT
me?

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:50pm EDT
what?

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:50pm EDT
whatchu talkin bout

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT
how are are? i'm fine, and how about you?

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT
oh lol

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT
that's like the extent of my spanish knowledge

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
you did that with french as well

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
oh

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
and

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
puedo ir al bano. idk how to spell that either. i can say it though

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
its not al lol

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
whatever

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
you know what i mean anyway

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
and i can say colours. but that's pretty useless

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
thas right, except for accents

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
i can count in spanish. i think

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
uno

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
i win!

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
i can count up to...

Steph DudakSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
i can count pretty high actually

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 4, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:51am EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:51am EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:51am EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:52am EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:53am EDT
you should

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:53am EDT
maybe idk but it was a pain in the ass

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:53am EDT
well, you've inspired me to start writing down my dreams again.

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:53am EDT
oh wait

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:53am EDT
there were two dreams before that

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:53am EDT
that were just as awful

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:53am EDT
lets see

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:53am EDT
dreams are always in 3s

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:53am EDT
no clue why

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:53am EDT
but mine always are

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:53am EDT
not mine

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:53am EDT
well the first one

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:55am EDT
in the dream, it was similar to the holocaust. but when i tell you about it, it's not similar really. yk what i mean? well basically, everyone is locked inside houses and if you left, you got killed. basically shot on site. there's cameras and shit everywhere. at one point, there was this person that asked a question and each time they did, the subject would disappear. so all the cameras, street lights, and other things from outside were gone

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:55am EDT
and someone was like AW YEA WE CAN ESCAPE NOW!! WOMP WOMP WHOS DOWN

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:55am EDT
but like no one wanted to go

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:55am EDT
apparently there was this one place everyone could flee too

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:55am EDT
but idk where bc like the entire US was locked inside their houses

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:55am EDT
it was just terrible.

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:56am EDT
the second one

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:56am EDT
was a game of baseball.

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:56am EDT
omfg.

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:56am EDT
ha

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:56am EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:56am EDT
funny dream

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:56am EDT
so i was on a team with josh evans. and like a buncha other people from school & people i've never seen were on that team and another, whatever

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:57am EDT
for whatever reason. it was this thing. it wasn;t even a full baseball field, it was this tiny little square. kinda the size of four , four square boxes. so think like a 4x4 yk.

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:57am EDT
maybe a bit bigger than that

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:57am EDT
i'm imagining

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:57am EDT
but so this other team was up first. and we apparently had to win but idk why. and they were jjust kicking our asses. FOR LIKE A HALF HOUR THOUGH. we were all just standing there and they were running bases.

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:58am EDT
and i was bored as hell and im like um when is the first inning gonna be over wtf?

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:58am EDT
so then other people on the other team started bitchin and being all oh yea we're cooler than you blahblah

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:58am EDT
and I DONT THINK WE EVEN WENT UP

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:58am EDT
but then we switched positions and i went to first base and i couldn't catch any ball that went in that direction and i was pissed

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:58am EDT
you should have practiced more in gym

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:59am EDT
then there was this like tv thing off to the side, not even by the bases but if you ran to that it counted for something

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:59am EDT
like moi

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:59am EDT
and i was like wtf

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:59am EDT
bc daechelle just walked over to it

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:59am EDT
and this other girl was like HAHAHA UR SO DUMB. and i was like bitch please

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:59am EDT
and walked into her and i guess the game ended

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:59am EDT
but it wasnt fun

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 1:59am EDT
i just find it amusing think you saying "bitch please"

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 2:00am EDT
totally amusing lol

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 2:00am EDT
ugh but they were like the worst dreams ever

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 2:00am EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 2:01am EDT
actually no . i mainly remember all the annoying/dumb ones that make no sense

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 2:02am EDT
they never make sense but they are always fun and happy and remind me of when I am content

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 2:02am EDT
its pretty sweet

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 2:02am EDT
haha that sounds pretty awesome

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 2:03am EDT
unfortunately that makes most of the dreams boring to everyone else

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 2:03am EDT
but its preferable to losing at baseball

Steph DudakTuesday, June 21, 2011 at 2:03am EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:40pm EDT

horde*

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:41pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:41pm EDT
horde

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:41pm EDT

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:41pm EDT

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:41pm EDT
what's difference?

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:41pm EDT
you'll have to figure that out when you go to make a character lol

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:42pm EDT
that'll take a while

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:42pm EDT
they're two different factions

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:42pm EDT
alliance races include:

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:42pm EDT
human, night elf, draenei (which all my alliance chars are, idk why lol. draenei male are ugly tho), uuuh. worgen, dwarf, gnomes

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:43pm EDT
and the different races have differnt abilities?

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:43pm EDT
after you pick a race, you need to pick a class

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:43pm EDT
and yes only certain races can be certain classes

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:43pm EDT
wowowow

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:43pm EDT
wait a sec

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:43pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:43pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:43pm EDT
*waiting*

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:44pm EDT
#5 says that there is locked software being downloaded to your computer that you aren't allowed to have access to, and

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:44pm EDT
#6 says that the game is allowed to moniter your actions on your computer and send info to blizzard whenever it wants

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:44pm EDT
WTF

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:45pm EDT
that will never happen

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:45pm EDT
dont matter

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:45pm EDT
its the thought that counts

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:45pm EDT
the evil thought

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:46pm EDT
what does all that even mean lol. i mean if you're like doing something that's affiliated with the game that you're not supposed to then that's different

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:46pm EDT
what is "locked software"

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:46pm EDT
just programs

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:47pm EDT
i'm guessing its unlockable sontent with special quests or whatever

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:47pm EDT
that you aren't allowed to immediatley obtain

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:47pm EDT
nothing bad really

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:47pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:48pm EDT
orc, troll, blood elf, goblin, tauren, and undead

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:50pm EDT
luckily with cata they redid the 1-60 questing so it's actually entertaining. but once you hit bc & wotlk questing it's not as fun. well imo. (but i've done bc questing like three times now.) but picks up again once you hit 80 and do cata questing. heh.

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:50pm EDT
gotcha, I can spend hours tearing down a mountain block by block

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:51pm EDT
i think i'll be fine with grinding and whatnot

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 8:51pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT
its dumb

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT
first aid is very imprtant

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
so which class gets all the animal stuff?

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
i guess if you don't have food

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
what do you mean animal stuff

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
as a hunter you can tame animals

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
but

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
like summoning

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
you can switch forms as a druid

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
YES

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
warlocks have pets too

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
minions

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
rather

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
um

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
actually

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
so do mages. they have a water elemental

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
druid or warlock

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
depends what you wanna do

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
see

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
warlock wears all cloth. they're only dps (damage). you get other pets as you go along the way

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
start with an imp, then whatever the blue thing is i can't think of

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
a succubus

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
and another guy

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 10:01pm EDT
druids though. are versatile. you can perform healer, tank, or dps roles

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 10:01pm EDT
and you get a million forms and wear leather armor

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 10:01pm EDT
well druids are natively celtic so I'm leaning towards that one

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 10:01pm EDT
bear form used for tanking. cat for feral dps. um. boomkin for dps. you dont get a form anymore for healing lol used to be a tree

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 10:02pm EDT
then you turn into a seal thing for your swimming form thing. and you have a flight form

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 10:02pm EDT
i played a druid up til about almost lvl 40 before i deleted it which was dumb. theyre fun

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 10:03pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 10:03pm EDT

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 10:05pm EDT
well

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 10:05pm EDT
worgen, theres even more forms! lol. cause you have a human form that you start off as before you turn into a worgen. so that's like all animal!

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 10:05pm EDT
it depends really

Steph DudakSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 10:05pm EDT
worgen is one of the newest classes

Nick DevlinSaturday, June 25, 2011 at 10:05pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:40pm EDT
HELP ME

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:41pm EDT
what do you need help with lol

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:41pm EDT
items, just items in general

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:42pm EDT
how do i sell them, do i have to have them in that little bar for them to work

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:42pm EDT
okay well firstly

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:43pm EDT
as far as armor goes, equip leather items. if you hover over them (say if it's a quest reward) it'll show if it's an upgrade or not with green +__ numbers, etc.

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:43pm EDT
to sell all the junk in your bags, just find a vendor somewhere

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:43pm EDT
check that inn, that giant building that you ran around in where your trainer was

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:43pm EDT
if you hover over them it'll be a bag

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:43pm EDT
right click the vendor, then right click the stuff in your bags to sell it

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:44pm EDT
i found some people with anvils

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:44pm EDT
yeah

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:44pm EDT
theyre fine

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:44pm EDT
the guys with anvils, once you progress you'll have to repair armor

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:44pm EDT
so i right click and they'll just take it?

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:44pm EDT
you go to those guys

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:44pm EDT
yes

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:44pm EDT
also when you go to your trainer and learn new spells and such, they should just shoot straight to your actionbar amirite?

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:45pm EDT
yes

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:45pm EDT
you have no clue how long it took me to realize that i had to learn the spell by talking to the guy

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:45pm EDT
lmao

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:46pm EDT
imma make a lower level toon so i can help you. plus once you get to higher lvls, you'll be able to start dungeons

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:46pm EDT
and i suggest dpsing instead of trynna tank or heal or anything

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:46pm EDT
awesome

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:46pm EDT
dps is just an attack person?

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:46pm EDT
yes, dps = damage

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:47pm EDT
once you hit level 10 you're able to start filling out talent trees

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:47pm EDT
awesome

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:47pm EDT
r

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:47pm EDT
you can go either balance or feral for dps, but it'll tell you that once you get the option so it's nothin to really worry about

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:47pm EDT
and you can always google builds and shit so

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:48pm EDT
silver coins are 100 copper?

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:49pm EDT
yep

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:49pm EDT
do you still only have the main bag?

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:49pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:49pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:50pm EDT
add Kirá to your friends list. i can make netherweave bags & send em to you. they're 16 slot bags so it'll be fine for now. extra bag space is always good lol

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:51pm EDT
cool

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:51pm EDT
can armour items stack?

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:51pm EDT
what do you mean?

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:52pm EDT
i got like 10 different shoes that give me differnt durability

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:52pm EDT
i i have like 3 of them on what happens?

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:52pm EDT
don't look at the durability on the items. you can only equip one

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:52pm EDT
look at stats, and the type of armor first

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:53pm EDT
durability is irrelevant

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:53pm EDT
...oh how do i get them out of that action bar at the bottom then?

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:53pm EDT
why are they in your action bar?

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:53pm EDT
why not?

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:53pm EDT
screenshot your game for me rn please lol

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:53pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:54pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:58pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:58pm EDT
how?!

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:58pm EDT
i cant drag them out

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:58pm EDT
click, hold and drag them into your bag

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:58pm EDT
unless your action bar is locked, in which case you'll have to unlock it. you'll have to go tooo.... Interface > action bars for that i believe

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:58pm EDT
i think that exists lol

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:59pm EDT
idk why theyre there in the first place nicholas!

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:59pm EDT
i'm just messing around

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:59pm EDT
oh but if those ones in the screenshot are better than the ones you're wearing, equip em

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 5:59pm EDT
i'll try

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:00pm EDT
they prob arent though lol

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:00pm EDT
theyre gray nvm womp

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:00pm EDT
I got them out! yay

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:01pm EDT
wooo!

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:01pm EDT
now how do i equip them, and get rid of old armour and junk?

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:01pm EDT
you just right click on em

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:02pm EDT
but dont do that if you're talking to a vendor, cause the nyoull just sell it lol

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:02pm EDT
hover over the item & press the shift key to see if itll be an upgrade

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:02pm EDT
yeah it's good

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:02pm EDT
at this point that'll be told by just how much armor an item has. and if it's green and says +__ armor or something then equip it. then just sell the old armor that it swapped

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:03pm EDT
what do you mean equip?

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:03pm EDT
i don't see an option for that

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:04pm EDT
you just asked me how to EQUIP items

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:04pm EDT
YES I DID

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:04pm EDT
when you right click on it, you equip it.

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:04pm EDT
if an item is an upgrade, it should be equipped.

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:05pm EDT
once you equip it, the old piece of armor you had on before that, will go into your bag. you then sell that old piece of armor, bc it's useless

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:05pm EDT
right click left click, WHY can't i remember the difference

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:05pm EDT
thanks

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:05pm EDT
XD

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:05pm EDT
sure sure

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:06pm EDT
okay one of these things says i dont have the proficcency to wear it

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:06pm EDT
if it's anything higher than leather you can't

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:07pm EDT
which includes mail & plate

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:07pm EDT
you can wear cloth, but don't.

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:07pm EDT
hoe do igain proficeny? leveling up?

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:07pm EDT
you will never be able to wear anything other than leather.

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:07pm EDT
...ever?

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:07pm EDT
because of your class

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:07pm EDT
ever

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:08pm EDT
let me explain:

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:08pm EDT
ahh, i better get some badass leather armour then

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:10pm EDT
there are cloth wearing classes. this includes priests, mages, and warlocks. that's all they can wear. then there are classes that wear medium armor: leather. this includes druids and rogues. and hunters at low levels. shaman wear leather at lower levels, but i THINK they may be able to wear mail come 40.. so same as hunters. don't quote me on that though. then there's mail. paladins, warriors.. they learn plate at level 40. and death knights wear plate as well. (death knights start at level 55 so they automatically start with plate)

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:10pm EDT
am i forgetting a class in there? idk hopefully not

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:11pm EDT
alright, so if the thing is red i can't wear it?

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:11pm EDT
correctt

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:11pm EDT
so when offered items for completing quests, i shouldn't pick those

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:12pm EDT
unless i want to sell the fo mony

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:12pm EDT
yes

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:12pm EDT
i was just gonna bring that u plol

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:12pm EDT
up *

Steph DudakSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:12pm EDT
if there isn't any leather available as a quest reward, or it just isn't an upgrade, go for whichever sells for more and just sell it

Nick DevlinSunday, June 26, 2011 at 6:13pm EDT
gotcha

Nick DevlinMonday, June 27, 2011 at 11:43am EDT
I spent far to long playing that game last night

Steph DudakMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:07pm EDT

Nick DevlinMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:08pm EDT
8

Steph DudakMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:08pm EDT
it's easy to spend a lot of time in that game though

Nick DevlinMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:08pm EDT

Nick DevlinMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:09pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:20pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:22pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:22pm EDT
soleil is officially gone x.x

Nick DevlinMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:22pm EDT
aww

Steph DudakMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:23pm EDT
i haven't played her in months. i think it's safe to say i wasn't ever going to

Steph DudakMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:23pm EDT
hunters are boring

Nick DevlinMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:24pm EDT
which are funnest?

Steph DudakMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:25pm EDT
don't ask me on that one. i've only fully leveled a paladin. and my priest is 65. i think both of those are fun to play

Steph DudakMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:25pm EDT
actually. here's a fun backstory. Soleil was originally a shaman, but kelly deleted her

Steph DudakMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:26pm EDT
my sister likes to make thousands of characters on different servers and like, doesnt play them. so i deleted those level like 1-3 characters. and soleil was about lvl 10ish and she deleted her cause she was mad.

Nick DevlinMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:26pm EDT
HhHaah

Steph DudakMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:26pm EDT
druids are fun too though. i played one up til about lvl 40

Steph DudakMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:26pm EDT
other than that i've played only a little of other classes

Steph DudakMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:26pm EDT
so

Nick DevlinMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:27pm EDT
alright

Nick DevlinMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:28pm EDT
this game is getting exponentially easier

Nick DevlinMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:28pm EDT
lvl 11

Steph DudakMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:30pm EDT
gogogo!

Nick DevlinMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:32pm EDT
oh!

Nick DevlinMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:32pm EDT
what talent do i pick?

Steph DudakMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:33pm EDT
have you read the overview things for each spec?

Steph DudakMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:33pm EDT
cause it depends. balance is a ranged dps. but you can also go feral dps, which is melee

Nick DevlinMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:33pm EDT
i like the animals forms, but hitting people from 100 feet away is so much easier...

Steph DudakMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:34pm EDT
and feral dps you need to be a cat like all the time. eventually, if you go balance, you get this form h.o

Nick DevlinMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:34pm EDT
well i already am a cat all the time

Steph DudakMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:34pm EDT
http://www.moonkin.net/moonkin.jpg

Nick DevlinMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:35pm EDT

a moonkin

Nick DevlinMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:36pm EDT
well i'm not going balance!

Steph DudakMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:37pm EDT
so i guess you're going feral dps. you use energy for that instead of mana

Nick DevlinMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:37pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:37pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:41pm EDT
http://fluiddruid.net/the-fluid-druid-4-0-1-cataclysm-feral-dps-guide/ May be helpful in deciding where to put talents, how to use em, etc. stats, blahblah. won't be too crucial at your level. but it's good to know what stats you're lookin for on armor

Nick DevlinMonday, June 27, 2011 at 12:42pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:10pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:10pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:11pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:11pm EDT
-.-.

Steph DudakThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:11pm EDT
well why would you do that lol

Steph DudakThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:12pm EDT
continue questing. you can also start using the dungeon finder. but sometimes the people aren't the nicest haha

Steph DudakThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:12pm EDT
queue in as dps of course

Nick DevlinThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:12pm EDT
so just keep finding more exlamation points?

Steph DudakThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:13pm EDT
yes, those would be quests. or start using the dungeon finder. oodles of fun. what level are you?

Nick DevlinThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:13pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:14pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:17pm EDT
sarcastic or genuine?

Steph DudakThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:17pm EDT
genuine

Nick DevlinThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:20pm EDT
all right so if i change form do i still have the stats i get from armour?

Steph DudakThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:21pm EDT
please elaborate

Nick DevlinThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:23pm EDT
i have like pants of nazirath or something that gives me +12 armour

Nick DevlinThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:23pm EDT
i turn to bear form

Nick DevlinThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:23pm EDT
do i still have the +12

Steph DudakThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:23pm EDT
yeah

Nick DevlinThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:23pm EDT
awesom

Steph DudakThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:23pm EDT
whatever armor you're wearing, that's the stats you get

Steph DudakThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:23pm EDT
that's also why at higher levels, if you dual spec, you're required to have different gear sets

Steph DudakThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:23pm EDT
like

Steph DudakThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:23pm EDT
if you plan to tank and dps, you need to different sets of gear

Steph DudakThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:24pm EDT
like for example, i have a tanking spec. so i need things with parry, dodge, and mastery on them. as opposed to my dps spec which is filled with crit, hit, mastery, etc.

Steph DudakThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:25pm EDT
bear form is used for tanking btw

Nick DevlinThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:25pm EDT
i usually use the cat

Steph DudakThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:25pm EDT
good good

Nick DevlinThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:26pm EDT
i really like the prowl thing that makes enemies ignore me

Steph DudakThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:27pm EDT
haha i bet

Steph DudakThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:27pm EDT
well i must go, so any other questions?

Nick DevlinThursday, June 30, 2011 at 2:27pm EDT
