Nick DevlinSunday, March 10, 2013 at 3:31pm EDT
home stuff: video games, cooking, movies... reading?

Steph DudakSunday, March 10, 2013 at 3:34pm EDT
also bowling

Nick DevlinSunday, March 10, 2013 at 3:34pm EDT
exactly

Nick DevlinSunday, March 10, 2013 at 3:34pm EDT
and bowling is really kinda meh for me, too much money for too little entertainment

Nick DevlinSunday, March 10, 2013 at 3:35pm EDT
laughing at each others failures can only last for so long

Nick DevlinSunday, March 10, 2013 at 3:35pm EDT
ohh

Nick DevlinSunday, March 10, 2013 at 3:35pm EDT
i just remembered something

Nick DevlinSunday, March 10, 2013 at 3:35pm EDT
there is an art gallery at occ

Nick DevlinSunday, March 10, 2013 at 3:36pm EDT
some of the stuff makes me cry inside

Nick DevlinSunday, March 10, 2013 at 3:36pm EDT
because it's the high school competition thing

Steph DudakSunday, March 10, 2013 at 3:37pm EDT
is it good?

Nick DevlinSunday, March 10, 2013 at 3:37pm EDT
a lot of them are pretty awesome

Steph DudakSunday, March 10, 2013 at 3:37pm EDT
so that can be a thing then

Nick DevlinSunday, March 10, 2013 at 3:37pm EDT
and it'd only take like 10 minutes to look through

Nick DevlinSunday, March 10, 2013 at 3:38pm EDT
so if you come to get me at school, we could just look through that before we do whatever i can think of to do

Steph DudakSunday, March 10, 2013 at 3:38pm EDT
that sounds coo then, now to actually think of things.

Steph DudakSunday, March 10, 2013 at 3:38pm EDT
i mean video games are always a good solution

Nick DevlinSunday, March 10, 2013 at 3:38pm EDT
they are

Nick DevlinSunday, March 10, 2013 at 3:39pm EDT
but they are like a last resort

Nick DevlinSunday, March 10, 2013 at 3:39pm EDT
we're gonna end up there eventually

Nick DevlinSunday, March 10, 2013 at 3:39pm EDT
but maybe if we think enough we'll hit upon some inspiration

Nick DevlinSunday, March 10, 2013 at 3:39pm EDT
i doubt it

Steph DudakSunday, March 10, 2013 at 3:39pm EDT
we can always bake again

Steph DudakSunday, March 10, 2013 at 3:39pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 12:03pm EDT
I hate

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 12:04pm EDT
when I'm assigned to analyze poems and short stories

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 12:04pm EDT
in terms of a certain literary device

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 12:04pm EDT
like plot or symbolism or irony

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 12:04pm EDT
But the given piece of work

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 12:04pm EDT
is a terrible example of that device

Steph DudakTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 12:35pm EDT
i am very sorry

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 4:19pm EDT
thank you

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 4:19pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 8:45pm EDT
hmm i think

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 8:45pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 8:45pm EDT
have you ever read the robert frost poem?

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 8:45pm EDT
the road not taken

Steph DudakTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 8:48pm EDT
ive heard of it

Steph DudakTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 8:48pm EDT
actually

Steph DudakTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 8:49pm EDT
i heard it on suite life of zack and cody

Steph DudakTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 8:49pm EDT
part of it

Steph DudakTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 8:50pm EDT
and i just read the whole thing SUP

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:02pm EDT
fhdusil

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:02pm EDT
umm

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:02pm EDT
what was i gonna say

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:02pm EDT
OH!

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:02pm EDT
I just read it again

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:02pm EDT
And normally people are all like, "This is a story about how taking the less traveled path is important

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:02pm EDT
and it made my life so much better"

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:03pm EDT
thats what it reads like yeah?

Steph DudakTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:04pm EDT
YEAH

Steph DudakTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:05pm EDT
oops

Steph DudakTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:05pm EDT
yeah

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:06pm EDT
well when i read it again

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:07pm EDT
i actually read it instead of assuming i remembered it right

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:07pm EDT
and the dude is completely lying at the end!

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:07pm EDT
"Though as for that the passing there	 Had worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally lay	 In leaves no step had trodden black."

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:07pm EDT
LOOK!

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:08pm EDT
He SAYS that they are exactly the same

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:08pm EDT
and the last three lines

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:08pm EDT
the ones every looks at, while ignoring the rest of the poem

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:08pm EDT
"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—	 I took the one less traveled by,	 And that has made all the difference."

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:08pm EDT
that what everyone judges based on

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:08pm EDT
RIGHT BEFORE

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:09pm EDT
He says "I shall be telling this with a sigh	 Somewhere ages and ages hence:"

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:09pm EDT
He's gonna tell a tale, a story, he basically made it up!

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:09pm EDT
And he says it with a sigh, like he is lying to himself

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:09pm EDT
bastard, trying to trick people

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:10pm EDT
so he is just trying to justify his decision

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:10pm EDT
to make himself seem cool, like some kind of trailblazing hero

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:10pm EDT
but really they were the same choice, and really, his route might have even been worse, and he'll never know

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:10pm EDT
he never says it was a good difference after all

Steph DudakTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:10pm EDT
http://www.gradesaver.com/the-poetry-of-robert-frost/study-guide/section11/

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:10pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:13pm EDT
THOSE BASTARDS

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:13pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:13pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:13pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:13pm EDT
ughhh

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:14pm EDT
this is worse than that time i thought i was the first person to think that "what if every elses green is different from my green in their head"

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:14pm EDT
then i found out that was like the most common philosophical question ever -.-

Steph DudakTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:15pm EDT
oh nicholas

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:15pm EDT
so dissapointing

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:15pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:16pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:17pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, March 19, 2013 at 9:17pm EDT
