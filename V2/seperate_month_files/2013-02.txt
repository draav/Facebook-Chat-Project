Steph DudakFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:12pm EST
they're not dots they're windows. like portholes.

Steph DudakFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:12pm EST
they're on both sides

Steph DudakFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:12pm EST
if you google maison a bordeaux

Nick DevlinFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:12pm EST
thats cool

Nick DevlinFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:13pm EST
but is there like any... patern or anything for the dots? or some reason as to why their all scrambled up

Steph DudakFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:13pm EST
he did it because he could

Nick DevlinFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:14pm EST
wasnt sure

Steph DudakFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:14pm EST
literally most of rem koolhaas' things well there is really no pattern. and only one elevation drawing so we need to basically make up the other side. but some do like up. like you can construct lines horizontally and there are like rows of holes but they're just spread out

Steph DudakFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:14pm EST
they're also tapered

Steph DudakFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:14pm EST
and well actually

Steph DudakFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:14pm EST
they give like different views of outside, around the house, etc.

Nick DevlinFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:15pm EST

Nick DevlinFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:15pm EST
i wasnt sure if like

Nick DevlinFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:15pm EST
something was written in braille or some crazy shit like that

Nick DevlinFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:16pm EST

Steph DudakFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:17pm EST

Nick DevlinFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:19pm EST

Steph DudakFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:19pm EST
his giant elevator is an office

Nick DevlinFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:20pm EST

Nick DevlinFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:20pm EST
also have you seen this?

Nick DevlinFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:20pm EST
i'm assuming you have

Steph DudakFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:20pm EST
yes i have

Nick DevlinFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:21pm EST
it was what i was thinking of

Nick DevlinFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:21pm EST
when i thought of weird shadow effects from the winows

Nick DevlinFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:22pm EST
no clue why

Steph DudakFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:23pm EST
no clue why either lol

Nick DevlinFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:23pm EST
youre supposed to know these things!

Steph DudakFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:45pm EST
im sorry!

Nick DevlinFriday, February 1, 2013 at 11:45pm EST
you are forgiven

Steph DudakMonday, February 4, 2013 at 11:12am EST
i feel like i'm getting dumber because my academic classes aren't real

Steph DudakMonday, February 4, 2013 at 11:13am EST
and i'm already bad at history but i'm even worse now. we have to do these "reaction papers" on articles that we have to read and i can never seem to grasp the actual concept of the essays i hate them and i should be able to understand them but i don't so it makes it even harder to get going on writing death

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 11:44am EST
thats extrememly irritating

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 11:44am EST
what articles you reading about/ what events

Steph DudakMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:05pm EST
http://www.memorablequotations.com/SquareDeal.htm this

Steph DudakMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:05pm EST
i just cant stay focused on it

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:06pm EST
ughh i hate this writing style

Steph DudakMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:06pm EST
its not a particularly difficult assignment but idk like its just what are they arguing then what i have to say about it, if i agree, and how it pertains to today

Steph DudakMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:06pm EST
and its boring

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:07pm EST
yeah thats unfun

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:07pm EST
i tried to read but its like one giant sentence

Steph DudakMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:07pm EST
literally puts me to sleep

Steph DudakMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:08pm EST
i also do not like that writing style

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:08pm EST
it a lot a useless words to sort through

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:10pm EST
"In his turn, the capitalist who is really a conservative, the man who has forethought as well as patriotism, should heartily welcome every effort, legislative or otherwise, which has for its object to secure fair dealing by capital, corporate or individual, toward the public and toward the employee." Real Americans should accept laws that regulate fairness, even when they are from the government, which everyone hates.

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:10pm EST
see was that so hard?

Steph DudakMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:11pm EST
this is from 1903 BUT NO IT WASNT it's not hard to talk and write so everyone can understand

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:12pm EST
but apparently the style back then was to be as obtuse as possible

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:14pm EST
oh well, and btw that sentence took me like a minute to translate, otherwise i'd help more

Steph DudakMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:15pm EST
basically

Steph DudakMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:15pm EST
what this is getting at

Steph DudakMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:16pm EST
because it's a speech is his "Square Deal" so basically i'll telll what that is. say what i think about it,

Steph DudakMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:16pm EST
use some sort of examples from the text, how it applies to today i don't even

Steph DudakMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:16pm EST
ugh

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:16pm EST
it wouldnt be that bad

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:17pm EST
if it was legible

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:17pm EST
all right i'm actually reading it

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:17pm EST
its actually more readable if you just skim as opposed to reading it

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:18pm EST
theres tons of ways to relate this speech to today

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:18pm EST
the second paragraph for example

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:18pm EST
"It has been our profound good fortune as a nation that hitherto, disregarding exceptional periods of depression and the normal and inevitable fluctuations, there has been on the whole from the beginning of our government to the present day a progressive betterment alike in the condition of the tiller of the soil and in the condition of the man who, by his manual skill and labor, supports himself and his family, and endeavors to bring up his children so that they may be at least as well off as, and, if possible, better off than, he himself has been. There are, of course, exceptions, but as a whole the standard of living among the farmers of our country has risen from generation to generation, and the wealth represented on the farms has steadily increased, while the wages of labor have likewise risen, both as regards the actual money paid and as regards the purchasing power which that money represents."

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:18pm EST
America is awesome

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:18pm EST
we continually get better

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:18pm EST
and there have but a couple rocky moments

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:19pm EST
but overall we've always gone up in awesomeness

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:19pm EST
just like today

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:19pm EST
its been a rocky era, but most of the country lives in relative comfort, no epidemics or plagues. Workers rights, cultural rights

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:20pm EST
no wars at home

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:20pm EST
etc

Steph DudakMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:22pm EST
makes sense

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:25pm EST
almost every paragraph is like that

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:25pm EST
its just so irritating

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:26pm EST
I think the overall message is "Hey guys, I got this"

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:27pm EST
Oh here's a good section

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:28pm EST
it ties in with healthcare and shit nowadays

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:28pm EST
"Unfortunately, in this world the innocent frequently find themselves obliged to pay some of the penalty for the misdeeds of the guilty; and so if hard times come, whether they be due to our own fault or to our misfortune, whether they be due to some burst of speculative frenzy that has caused a portion of the business world to lose its head -- a loss which no legislation can possibly supply -- or whether they be due to any lack of wisdom in a portion of the world of labor--in each case, the trouble once started is felt more or less in every walk of life. It is all-essential to the continuance of our healthy national life that we should recognize this community of interest among our people. The welfare of each of us is dependent fundamentally upon the welfare of all of us, and therefore in public life that man is the best representative of each of us who seeks to do good to each by doing good to all; in other words, whose endeavor it is not to represent any special class and promote merely that class's selfish interests, but to represent all true and honest men of all sections and all classes and to work for their interests by working for our common country. We can keep our government on a sane and healthy basis, we can make and keep our social system what it should be, only on condition of judging each man, not as a member of a class, but on his worth as a man. It is an infamous thing in our American life, and fundamentally treacherous to our institutions, to apply to any man any test save that of his personal worth, or to draw between two sets of men any distinction save the distinction of conduct, the distinction that marks off those who do well and wisely from those who do ill and foolishly. There are good citizens and bad citizens in every class as in every locality, and the attitude of decent people toward great public and social questions should be determined, not by the accidental questions of employment or locality, but by those deep-set principles which represent the innermost souls of men. The failure in public and in private life thus to treat each man on his own merits, the recognition of this government as being either for the poor as such or for the rich as such, would prove fatal to our Republic, as such failure and such recognition have always proved fatal in the past to other republics. A healthy republican government must rest upon individuals, not upon classes or sections. As soon as it becomes government by a class or by a section, it departs from the old American ideal."

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:28pm EST
so long x.x

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:28pm EST
but basically it just talks about how there will always be assholes that bring our collective awesome down

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:28pm EST
but we can't judge groups based on the assholishness of a couple guys

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:29pm EST
if we governed based on the few assholes

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:29pm EST
our country would suck

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:30pm EST
and we shouldnt judge based on social class either

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:30pm EST
there are awesome people in every walk of class and those people should be recognized for their awesome

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:31pm EST
he also says somewhere in there that people should not be compared against eachother, we are all so different. We should only be judged in rgards to how well we can obey our communal laws

Steph DudakMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:32pm EST
so basically he focuses a lot on increasing equality between people and especially between workers

Steph DudakMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:33pm EST
different kinds of workers

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:33pm EST
pretty much

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:33pm EST
he talks about how all people contribute and if anyone leaves then our country is down the tank

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:34pm EST
but this paragraph is more in response

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:34pm EST
to the moochers

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:34pm EST
the ones who try to live off benefits

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:34pm EST
and other junk

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:37pm EST
at least I think

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:37pm EST
I'm really guessing a lot

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:37pm EST
but it fits

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:37pm EST
so why not?

Steph DudakMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:38pm EST
haha true

Steph DudakMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:38pm EST
makes sense i suppose

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:39pm EST
If I knew any actual history, I might be better at this

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:39pm EST
but I have very little context

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:39pm EST
basically what I'd do is think of three things that this president wanted to reform

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:39pm EST
and find a couple quotes in the speech that refer to that

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:40pm EST
then mess with the quotes to relate it to some random event happening now

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:40pm EST
as opposed to trying to actually read

Steph DudakMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:42pm EST
The Square Deal was President Theodore Roosevelt's domestic program formed upon three basic ideas: conservation of natural resources, control of corporations, and consumer protection.[1] These three demands are often referred to as the "three C's" of Roosevelt's Square Deal. Thus, it aimed at helping middle class citizens and involved attacking plutocracy and bad trusts while at the same time protecting business from the most extreme demands of organized labor. In contrast to his predecessor William McKinley, Roosevelt was a Republican who believed in government action to mitigate social evils, and as president denounced “the representatives of predatory wealth” as guilty of “all forms of iniquity from the oppression of wage workers to defrauding the public.”[2]

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:45pm EST
sounds good to me

Steph DudakMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:48pm EST
i feel like this

Steph DudakMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:48pm EST
The average American knows not only that he himself intends to do what is right, but that his average fellow countryman has the same intention and the same power to make his intention effective. He knows, whether he be business man, professional man, farmer, mechanic, employer, or wage-worker, that the welfare of each of these men is bound up with the welfare of all the others; that each is neighbor to the other, is actuated by the same hopes and fears, has fundamentally the same ideals, and that all alike have much the same virtues and the same faults.”

Steph DudakMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:48pm EST
is just a general thing that can be applied to today because for some reason i read it in obama's voice since he's always so we're all equal we're all here for the same reason, love each other blahblahblah. all in this together bye

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:49pm EST
just quote high school musical while your at it

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:49pm EST
you could talk about how intricate our society is?

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:49pm EST
like just to make a like pencil

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:49pm EST
takes so many god damn people

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:50pm EST
if one stage shuts down, then we're all outta pencils

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:53pm EST
so if like the tree farmers decide to fuck off and quit

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:54pm EST
or if the guy who designs pencils takes back his copyright

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:54pm EST
etc

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:54pm EST
but in a larger social sense

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:54pm EST
the people who make the food

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:54pm EST
the people who keep roads usable

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:55pm EST
the doctors

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:55pm EST
teachers

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:55pm EST
businessmen

Steph DudakMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:56pm EST
was that a complete thought

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:56pm EST
ish

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:56pm EST
if you got the idea

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:56pm EST
then that is my complete thought

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:56pm EST
can elaborate more if you wish

Steph DudakMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:58pm EST
please

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:58pm EST
Everyone is important in society. We all do different things in order to keep society running. But we are all still people that have hopes and dreams.

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:58pm EST
So in his speech he says that

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:58pm EST
which related to his ideal of consumer protection I suppose

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:59pm EST
This message pervades to even today

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:59pm EST
because our society has become extremely specialized

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 12:59pm EST
no one would be able to survive in our society with our level of comfort, if they lived alone

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 1:00pm EST
They need all of society to support them. Teachers to take care of kids. Police to protect Farmers for food Merchants to move around the food Business to organize it all

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 1:01pm EST
As a current event topic

Steph DudakMonday, February 4, 2013 at 1:01pm EST
that was much more clear

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 1:02pm EST
talk about the bus driver strike in new york city

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 1:02pm EST
they seem like an unimprtant job

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 1:02pm EST
but once they all quit, kids couldnt get to school

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 1:02pm EST
parents had to take off work to get kids to school

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 1:02pm EST
all their jobs were affected

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 1:03pm EST
other public transport waqs innundated messing with all their schedules

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 1:03pm EST
teachers had trouble keping kids attention

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 1:03pm EST
just because bus drivers quit

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 1:09pm EST
so just any other current event that is related

Nick DevlinMonday, February 4, 2013 at 1:09pm EST
should work fine

Steph DudakMonday, February 4, 2013 at 1:09pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:48pm EST
this semester is real cray with work mainly design since we have like three projects and like not that much time to get them done plus technics which is basically the work equivalent of a D1 class it's nuts

Steph DudakSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:48pm EST
that is exciting though!

Steph DudakSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:48pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:50pm EST
OH!

Nick DevlinSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:51pm EST
its a different oh from before

Nick DevlinSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:51pm EST
i thought of something new that deserved and oh

Nick DevlinSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:51pm EST
What classes are you taking this semester

Nick DevlinSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:51pm EST
I dont think you ever told me

Nick DevlinSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:51pm EST
and if you did i have a horrid memory

Steph DudakSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:52pm EST
i'm not sure that i did, i often just complain about them all lol design 2, h american transitions (pls kill me), italian 1, technics of communication, and physics

Nick DevlinSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:52pm EST
i should get around to taking a physics class

Nick DevlinSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:52pm EST
maybe this summer

Steph DudakSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:52pm EST
general physics literally

Steph DudakSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:53pm EST
im pretty sure

Steph DudakSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:53pm EST
he doesnt grade based on correctness, but on the work that we do

Steph DudakSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:53pm EST
because i've gotten no lower than an A on anything and idk what the hell im even doing sometimes

Steph DudakSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:53pm EST
like in labs

Nick DevlinSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:53pm EST
thats no fun

Nick DevlinSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:53pm EST
and what is technics of communication/ american transitions

Nick DevlinSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:54pm EST
im guessing its a history and tech class

Steph DudakSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:54pm EST
ugh yes so technics is half computer stuff (photoshop, indesign, maybe illustrator later??) and half actual drawing

Steph DudakSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:54pm EST
american transitions SUCKS

Steph DudakSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:55pm EST
its that history class where i need to just write a paper every week on whatever he has us read

Steph DudakSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:55pm EST
and he talks for an hour every class

Nick DevlinSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:56pm EST
borring

Nick DevlinSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:56pm EST
i am so glad i dont see any history classes in my forseeable future

Steph DudakSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:56pm EST
ugh its so bad because its just a useless history class

Nick DevlinSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:56pm EST
the technics one sounds fun enough though

Steph DudakSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:56pm EST
we're not actually LEARNING anything

Steph DudakSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:56pm EST
and i already hate history

Steph DudakSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:56pm EST
i have to take architectural history classes in the future those are relevant

Steph DudakSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:57pm EST
wyatt talking for 50 mins about whatever is not

Nick DevlinSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:57pm EST
i can see how

Nick DevlinSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:57pm EST
unfun

Steph DudakSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:57pm EST
technics is actually not that fun, but its because i have carol. EXCEPT my next project i get to do a thing like draw diagrams and things for how to make smores haha its awesome

Nick DevlinSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:59pm EST
that sounds awesome

Nick DevlinSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:59pm EST
i found some sign at school that says free photshop class at some building somewhere

Nick DevlinSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:59pm EST
not on campus

Nick DevlinSunday, February 24, 2013 at 11:59pm EST
ireally wanna check it out

Steph DudakMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:01am EST
hopefully it's legit cause that'd be a good thing to do

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:01am EST
it would

Steph DudakMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:01am EST
i really wanna learn illustrator

Steph DudakMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:01am EST
so bad

Steph DudakMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:01am EST
i tried to teach myself and it just never worked out

Steph DudakMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:01am EST
and i dont have time to teach myself now

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:01am EST
yeah i know that feeling

Steph DudakMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:01am EST

oh jeez one of those things who knows

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:09am EST
"do you know what my son is being for halloween? a ghost, because he decided to drink and drive."

Steph DudakMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:16am EST
scary place

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:17am EST

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:17am EST
i've been pretty awesome for a while

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:17am EST

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:24am EST
oh well

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:24am EST
i think it mght be time to surrender to my homework

Steph DudakMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:27am EST
might be a good idea

Steph DudakMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:27am EST
get it done and sleepz

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:27am EST

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:28am EST
no idea

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:28am EST

Steph DudakMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:29am EST
that'd be great

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:30am EST
one day there will be a slow down button

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:30am EST
I want to be there for it

Steph DudakMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:31am EST
a pause button would be nice

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:31am EST
i was figuring the slow down button would be adjustable

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:32am EST
depending on how you are feeling

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:32am EST
or for the situation

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:37am EST
alright

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:37am EST
time to pass out

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 12:37am EST

Steph DudakMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:22pm EST
NICK

Steph DudakMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:23pm EST
important question

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:23pm EST
STEPH

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:23pm EST
Hopefully an answer

Steph DudakMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:23pm EST
do you remember how we did those cylinder stretchouts in bachelors?

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:23pm EST
yep :)

Steph DudakMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:23pm EST
is it something you can explain to me

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:24pm EST
possibly

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:25pm EST
hmm lemme think for a minute to draw it out and make sure it make sense

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:26pm EST
what kind of cyclider do you need?

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:26pm EST
right cylinder

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:26pm EST
truncated?

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:26pm EST
cone?

Steph DudakMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:27pm EST
normal cylinder

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:27pm EST
easy

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:31pm EST
Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:31pm EST
draw side and top view

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:32pm EST
the tube part of cilder is a rectangle, height of cylinder X circumference of circle

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:32pm EST
break into equivalent sections to make sure eveything lines up when you glue the circle and tube together

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:32pm EST
to make tabs:

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:33pm EST
rectangle is obvious

Steph DudakMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:33pm EST
the rectangle is (height)(circumference) thats what youre telling me

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:33pm EST
circle- make a bigger circle, cut little tabs based off the broken up sections

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:33pm EST
hmm yeah

Steph DudakMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:34pm EST
how do i divide the circle? do i need to make the rectangle first then divide that up into the little sections that i need to score in order to figure tha tout?

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:34pm EST
just make a bunch of center lines

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:34pm EST
cut in half

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:34pm EST
then quarters

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:34pm EST
then eighths

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:34pm EST
usually 16th is best

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:35pm EST
divide the rectangle into 16th as well

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:35pm EST
halves and halves and halves

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:35pm EST
all the lines on circle will match up with rectangle

Steph DudakMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:37pm EST
im asking because i need to hand draw this

Steph DudakMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:37pm EST
i have no internet things at my disposal

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:37pm EST
unfun

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:37pm EST
its pretty simple

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:48pm EST
tell me if you have any problems

Steph DudakMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:50pm EST
womp ill let you know thank you

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:51pm EST
no problem

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:51pm EST
this was probably my favourite class ever

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 8:51pm EST
actually i am researching now into mechanical engineering majors

Steph DudakMonday, February 25, 2013 at 9:36pm EST
oh really

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 9:36pm EST
yeah a litle bit

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 9:36pm EST
they dont really have what i want though :/

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 9:36pm EST
might as well stick to comp sci

Nick DevlinMonday, February 25, 2013 at 9:37pm EST
but who knows its an option

Steph DudakWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:30pm EST
okie so as mr wong says, you want to get rid of the "mess". which is essentially the more complicated part of the problem. in this case it's 1+x-x^3, you have to do a lot with that. so you're going to make 1+x-x^3 = u. that's the first step. 1. 1+x-x^3 = u Now you need to find the derivative of that 2. 1-3x^2 = u' Once you've done that, you need f(u), which really means replace u in the original equation. (That means make 1+x-x^3, u in the original). so that 3. f(u) = u(e^x) theeeen do derive that, you need to use product rule. separate them into two, u and e^x 1. u 3. e^x 2. 1 4. e^x cross multiply and you get ue^x(e^x). this is 4. f'(u) = ue^x(e^x) then you take that and multiply it by u'

Steph DudakWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:30pm EST
idk if that last part is right

Steph DudakWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:30pm EST
the very last

Steph DudakWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:32pm EST
im trying to help someone with math homework homie

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:32pm EST
i'm trying to read it

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:33pm EST
can you just give me the original problem

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:33pm EST
and i will solve it

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:33pm EST
and explain how

Steph DudakWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:33pm EST
(1+X-x^3)e^x

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:33pm EST
it's hard to understand what you wrote

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:34pm EST
ohh i get what you mean

Steph DudakWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:34pm EST
am i correct or no?

Steph DudakWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:35pm EST
and then you multiply f'(u) times u' or

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:36pm EST
all right

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:37pm EST
what is your answer?

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:37pm EST
from doing your steps?

Steph DudakWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:37pm EST
ue^x(e^x) ( 1-3x^2)

Steph DudakWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:37pm EST
nothing combined or anything

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:37pm EST
no, your answer should be something similar to

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:38pm EST
you're going to have addition

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:38pm EST
like (-x^3+x+1)·e^x+(1-3x^2)·e^x

Steph DudakWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:39pm EST
okay but why i was only asking if a certain part i was doing was correct

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:39pm EST
i'm trying to find the part where you messed up

Steph DudakWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:39pm EST
which was 3. f(u) = u(e^x) theeeen do derive that, you need to use product rule. separate them into two, u and e^x 1. u 3. e^x 2. 1 4. e^x cross multiply and you get ue^x(e^x). this is 4. f'(u) = ue^x(e^x) then you take that and multiply it by u' all of that.

Steph DudakWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:39pm EST
that is the part that i was unsure about. the first two steps are right.

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:40pm EST
there's no cross multiplication

Steph DudakWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:41pm EST
you need to add them dont you

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:41pm EST
this isnt a chain rule problem

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:41pm EST
its just a product rule

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:41pm EST
you're way overcomplicating it

Steph DudakWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:42pm EST
it's not for me

Steph DudakWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:42pm EST
someone sent me a problem saying solve with chain rule

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:42pm EST
well idk how

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:42pm EST
its a product rule problem

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:43pm EST
f(x)=(1+X-x^3)e^x h(x)=(1+X-x^3) g(x)=e^x f'(x)=h'(x)g(x)+h(x)g'(x)

Steph DudakWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:43pm EST
the way i wrote it you would cross multiply it

Steph DudakWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:44pm EST
it's just simpler to explain

Steph DudakWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:44pm EST
it's those same principles

Steph DudakWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:44pm EST
of course add them

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:44pm EST
maybe, when you say cross multiply i think fractions

Steph DudakWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:44pm EST
which i failed to do

Steph DudakWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:44pm EST
im not going to try to explain it to you

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:44pm EST
i read that in my head as like

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:44pm EST
I dont gotta explain myself to you

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:44pm EST
very angry

Steph DudakWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:45pm EST
so whats the answer ?

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:45pm EST
(-x^3+x+1)·e^x+(1-3x^2)·e^x

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:47pm EST
because h'(x)=(1-3x^2) g'(x)=e^x

Steph DudakWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:47pm EST
i know why

Steph DudakWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:47pm EST
i wanted to be sure.

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:48pm EST
yeah i was just making sure you understood what i was talkin bout too

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:48pm EST
sorry i took a while to understood


Steph Dudak: 154
Nick Devlin: 318
