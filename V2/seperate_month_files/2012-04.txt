Nick DevlinSunday, April 1, 2012 at 9:55pm EDT
i like to feel superior

Nick DevlinSunday, April 1, 2012 at 9:55pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, April 1, 2012 at 9:56pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:00pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:02pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:07pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:07pm EDT
that i did not enjoy reading

Steph DudakSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:07pm EDT
so i felt like i had to share it with you

Nick DevlinSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:07pm EDT
yeah, calling people smart for reading leet

Nick DevlinSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:08pm EDT
i mean thinking about it yeah, it's interesting that brains can do it

Nick DevlinSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:08pm EDT
but still

Nick DevlinSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:08pm EDT
it's stupid

Steph DudakSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:08pm EDT
it's really not that impressive

Steph DudakSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:08pm EDT
if you can read it

Nick DevlinSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:08pm EDT
i figure it's the same as reading any font

Nick DevlinSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:09pm EDT
i just think that visual recognition is impressive as a physical characteristic of humans.

Steph DudakSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:09pm EDT
any idiot can figure it out i think. i mean. 5's look like S's 7's look like T's 0's look like O's 1's look like I's

Nick DevlinSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
i like how people can read capitols and lowercases and cursive and handwriting all without much difficulty

Steph DudakSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:13pm EDT
True

Nick DevlinSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:15pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:38pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:38pm EDT
i had a 78.55 before the notebook & the quarterly

Steph DudakSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:39pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:39pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:41pm EDT
i've never been happier to get a C

Nick DevlinSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:42pm EDT
i just want to pass my classes

Nick DevlinSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:42pm EDT
A and B are like little presents from who knows where

Steph DudakSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:48pm EDT
passing classes is good

Nick DevlinSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:55pm EDT
i agree

Nick DevlinSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:55pm EDT
it prevents the loss of scholarship moneys

Steph DudakSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:56pm EDT
Indeed it does

Steph DudakSunday, April 1, 2012 at 10:57pm EDT
Now that I've wasted 20 mins watching Jesse hilariously fail at a quest on the ptr bc it's bugged I am going to shower and then sleep See you in lunch Goodnight!

Nick DevlinSunday, April 1, 2012 at 11:08pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 8:24pm EDT

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:26pm EDT
hmmmm?

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
Yay!

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
Ok

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
I didn't get to ask you at lunch. I need an opinion

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
on?

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
Can you see the background designs?

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
barely

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
but holy shit

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
that right side

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
This any better ?

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
i get the general idea of the lines

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
The right is just straight lines do

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
So *

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
Oh right my question

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
Duh so

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT
I'm not sure what colors I wanna use for the background on that side

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT
If I stick with the same ones, it'll blend in too much and Do not want

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:31pm EDT
yes

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:31pm EDT
hmm

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:31pm EDT
Also Should I outline the designs in black too? And color the insides

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
the background designs should be outlined yes

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
but maybe less thick

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
Thought so too. I'll

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
and the colours....

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
Yeah I was gonna say

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
hmmm

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
I'll make those thinner or the outside outline of the person thicker

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:33pm EDT
Thinner, Calicch has fancy pens I can use for that lol

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:33pm EDT
always go with the option that has fancy things

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:34pm EDT
would complimentary colours work? for the background

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:34pm EDT
blues and purples?

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:34pm EDT
I was thinking about that Hesitated only bc the eye

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:34pm EDT
Then I was thinking of putting in green in the back with them

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:34pm EDT
But

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:34pm EDT
yrah the green muight mess

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:34pm EDT
The only red is the cheek

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:35pm EDT
So

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:35pm EDT
but i don'rt think it'll be that bad

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:36pm EDT
Purples and blues might work well I'm probs gonna have to test it on another paper

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:36pm EDT
good idea

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:36pm EDT
Now

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:37pm EDT
I was thinking of having each section fade Not just be like flat blue flat purple

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:37pm EDT
Have the blues and purples mixed in in each section maybe fading

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:37pm EDT
Left to right I dunno But then

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:37pm EDT
The right side

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:38pm EDT
Those plain grey stripes. I think I'll do just one solid shade of grey ?

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:38pm EDT
i think that by the end

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:38pm EDT
it should be

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:38pm EDT
like around the face would be

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:38pm EDT
but slow it should transition into more exciting colours

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
so near the colourful face would be much more vibrant and flashy then become greyer and more muted and blended together as they go left

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
so near the colourful face the colors should be very distinct

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
just an idea

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:40pm EDT
That's what I mean But I mean like on the right have no shading

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:40pm EDT
Just flat grey when it hits the other end

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:40pm EDT
Obviously I'll have to transition and have the middle be duller colors

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:41pm EDT
here

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:42pm EDT
Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:42pm EDT
up until the blck line can be flat grey

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:43pm EDT
past that i think there should be very subtle alterations in tone

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:46pm EDT
Hm hm hm

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:55pm EDT
ugh my facebook is breaking

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 9:55pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 10:36pm EDT
Not at all I wish these blues and purples were brighter and not as dark

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 10:44pm EDT
use electric blue

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 10:44pm EDT
and a magenta

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 10:44pm EDT
but more purply

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 10:44pm EDT
maybe not electric but you know what i mean

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 10:51pm EDT
Yeah

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 10:51pm EDT
Most of the blues are dark and then there's aquamarine and light aqua

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 10:52pm EDT
Which don't fit with the purples

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 10:52pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 10:52pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 10:53pm EDT
True blue, which is the blue I used in that tear face thing Peacock blue Violet Parma violet And mulberry

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 10:53pm EDT
Peacock blue is kind of a stretch FRUSTRATING

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 10:54pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 10:59pm EDT
IS SHE SERIOUSLY

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 10:59pm EDT
"Screw it. I'm done looking through this idiotic meme site that insults numerous people going to East, including people I know. Final straw: calling everyone in Skills Club (AKA Strategy Club) autistic."

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 10:59pm EDT
That's the opening statement in her essay bashing the meme sight

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 11:00pm EDT
She's in strategy club

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 11:00pm EDT
mhmm

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 11:00pm EDT
Yo doesn't mr tierney run that

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 11:00pm EDT

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 11:02pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 11:02pm EDT
She used to go to east but she goes to south now but one was made about her. And it was (incorrectly spelled btw) Noel Lopez Y u no look good in person or something along those lines.

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 11:03pm EDT
i saw that one

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 11:03pm EDT
Needless to say she was not happy and I don't really blame her I think the whole thing is ridiculous And this is why we can't have nice things and why kids that go to our school shouldn't be allowed on the Internet

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 11:05pm EDT
south is almost as bad

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 11:06pm EDT
i haven't gone back onto east

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 11:06pm EDT
but judging from from people's comments they are just douchey

Nick DevlinMonday, April 2, 2012 at 11:06pm EDT
south is jsut stupid

Steph DudakMonday, April 2, 2012 at 11:06pm EDT

How will this impact your college plans, career and life? 4. How will you benefit from this scholarship?

Steph DudakWednesday, April 4, 2012 at 9:55pm EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, April 4, 2012 at 9:55pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, April 4, 2012 at 9:55pm EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, April 4, 2012 at 9:55pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, April 4, 2012 at 9:55pm EDT
if you say so...

Steph DudakWednesday, April 4, 2012 at 9:56pm EDT
then i contemplated putting an unfinished drawing on the paper or a drawing with scribbles all over it kinda how most of my ideas end up

Nick DevlinWednesday, April 4, 2012 at 10:02pm EDT
combine them

Nick DevlinWednesday, April 4, 2012 at 10:02pm EDT
i mean

Nick DevlinWednesday, April 4, 2012 at 10:02pm EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, April 6, 2012 at 8:53pm EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, April 6, 2012 at 9:04pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:06pm EDT
Just disorders in general

Steph DudakMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:06pm EDT

Nick DevlinMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:06pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:07pm EDT
And other stuff

Steph DudakMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:07pm EDT
But that was hours ago that I asked you that question

Nick DevlinMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:07pm EDT

Nick DevlinMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:13pm EDT
OH!

Nick DevlinMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:13pm EDT
Ennui

Nick DevlinMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:13pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:13pm EDT
Ennui?

Nick DevlinMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:13pm EDT
basically dying of bredom

Nick DevlinMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:14pm EDT
boredom

Steph DudakMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:14pm EDT
I should've guessed that

Steph DudakMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:14pm EDT
Enneyeux I think Is bored in French

Nick DevlinMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:14pm EDT
its when you literally lack the desire to do things. Like When I wish I wanted to

Nick DevlinMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:15pm EDT
Origin: 166070; < French: boredom; Old French enui displeasure;

Steph DudakMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:15pm EDT
Yep

Nick DevlinMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:15pm EDT
that was an odd copy and paste, it reattached my half erased message

Nick DevlinMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:15pm EDT
anyway

Steph DudakMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:17pm EDT
I'm going to hand all these in And then she's gonna say "what about disorders" "you can do better"

Nick DevlinMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:17pm EDT
probsbly

Steph DudakMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
"but now it's too late" *thunder*

Nick DevlinMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
how about the manifestation of mental disorders

Nick DevlinMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
it has some big words so you can't go wrong

Nick DevlinMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:18pm EDT
plus it's almost aliterative

Steph DudakMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:20pm EDT
Perhaps. See like

Steph DudakMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:21pm EDT
I could go from more abstract to tangible things And Not just mental disorders

Steph DudakMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:21pm EDT
I mean

Nick DevlinMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:22pm EDT
you should do one on Cerebellar Hypoplasia

Steph DudakMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:22pm EDT
My idea for bipolar is cliche It's just a bunch of makes Mainly it gives me an excuse to draw my masquerade mask But That's a tangible thing it's just an object

Steph DudakMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:23pm EDT
Whereas

Steph DudakMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:23pm EDT
Foor

Steph DudakMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:25pm EDT
Borderline personality the idea was to have a bunch of random designs and stuff that represent different feelings or emotions at least how I see them. But the bottom right corner of the page is drawn to look like the page is being turned and "underneath it" is going to be either the silhouette or outline of a person Representing a sort of dissociation With their own emotions and blah blah

Steph DudakMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:26pm EDT
And detachment *

Nick DevlinMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:26pm EDT
that's good

Steph DudakMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:27pm EDT
And then for ADHD I have an in between thing

Steph DudakMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:28pm EDT
It's a cube. With different things on each side idk what. But the top is open. And a bunch of things are coming out of it and around the page I was thinking of having random doodles and some little things in there that look unfinished

Steph DudakMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:29pm EDT
Change in subject, lack of focus and interest in finishing what was started bc of other things

Nick DevlinMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:30pm EDT
makes sense

Nick DevlinMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:31pm EDT
I am searching my tumblr for something awesome and relevant to what you are doing

Steph DudakMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:37pm EDT

Nick DevlinMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:54pm EDT
i shall remember it for the future

Nick DevlinMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:55pm EDT
but to remember i must organize my brains memories for today

Nick DevlinMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:55pm EDT
which means

Nick DevlinMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:55pm EDT
sleep

Nick DevlinMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:55pm EDT

Nick DevlinMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:55pm EDT
making me lose hair steph

Nick DevlinMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:55pm EDT
:P

Steph DudakMonday, April 9, 2012 at 11:55pm EDT
Thank you :p hahaha sorry Have fun sleeping, goodnight!

Steph DudakTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 6:26pm EDT
I feel like the stuff I associate with other stuff makes no sense Do wanna see this uncolored drawing so far

Steph DudakTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 6:26pm EDT
do you*

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 6:26pm EDT
of course

Steph DudakTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 6:28pm EDT
It's a little hard to see some of the stuff. Meh. It feels empty to me but I think it'll fill up once it's colored. I haven't put the person in the corner yet I have a feeling I'll have to redo this one though just because no one will really understand what I'm trying to get across with it. It all makes sense in my head. Doesn't it always. I'm putting that on my tombstone

Steph DudakTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 6:31pm EDT
In the corner there's an eye and tears. Sadness. The swirl and flower are just things I think are pretty. Swirly water and sun , peaceful Flames around part of the flower, anger The circles are not full therefore incomplete Those lines inbetween the petals are like confusion But they're just things I represent these things with. I feel like calicch thinks I try to make it seem like. General? With my work? And how other people would or could feel? But I don't.

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:12pm EDT
i think calicch's opinion isn't really important

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:12pm EDT
just as long as you finish it

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:12pm EDT
and have an explanation

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:12pm EDT
that makes sense to you

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:13pm EDT
The big problem you keep saying she has is that you always leave things half done

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:13pm EDT
just finish all your shit

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:13pm EDT
and she'll be happy

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:13pm EDT
plus i remember you said she likes your design oriented doodling ones

Steph DudakTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:15pm EDT
Oh I'll have it finished I'm just worried about it not feeling coherent when a scorer or someone looks at it with the others It's more just based off that one specific part of bpd so. Whatever. Yeah I gotcha

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:17pm EDT
it reminds me of some of the others

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:17pm EDT
like the one with the house

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:17pm EDT
and th shrooms

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:17pm EDT
and the seashell

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:17pm EDT
/teardrop looking one

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:19pm EDT
are all of those in the concentration now?

Steph DudakTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:21pm EDT
No I don't feel like they really fit The shrooms one potentially could But I'd still needa redo it

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:26pm EDT
yeah

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:26pm EDT
i think i'm gonna make that tumblr now

Steph DudakTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:28pm EDT
Good luck

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:29pm EDT
i'm just really bored

Steph DudakTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:41pm EDT
Send me the link when you're done with it, I'll follow it rofl Do you still have that sounds like a personal problem one? Haha

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:41pm EDT
yeah i just looked at it

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:41pm EDT
there's still just the one pic

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:42pm EDT
yeah need to ruthlessly mock the one I make once it's done

Steph DudakTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:42pm EDT
I didn't know you even had one picture up

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:43pm EDT
http://sounds-like-a-personal-problem.tumblr.com/

Steph DudakTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:44pm EDT
Hahahaha

Steph DudakTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:44pm EDT
I'm not sure why but that's hilarious

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:54pm EDT
ughh

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:54pm EDT
all the somewhat decent ones are gone

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:54pm EDT
do you remember any good ones?

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 7:54pm EDT
I remember julies

Steph DudakTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 8:04pm EDT
Um Aside from the ones bashing how kids at our school can't properly make memes

Steph DudakTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 8:04pm EDT
I found some of those funny UM

Steph DudakTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 8:05pm EDT
I can't think of any I just remember the plethora of ones about dish and mr Lombardo

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 8:05pm EDT
oh god so many about dish

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 8:26pm EDT
i think i should make a french 4 joke

Steph DudakTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 8:27pm EDT
i would be okay with that

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 8:30pm EDT
see as there isn't one

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 8:30pm EDT
no one should be offended

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 10, 2012 at 8:53pm EDT
YES

Nick DevlinWednesday, April 11, 2012 at 8:11pm EDT
A midsummers Night Dream is a comedic play about different relationships between a wide variety of people. The play starts off by introducing the audience to Theseus, who is to be wed to Hippolyta in a few days. They are planning aspects of the wedding when suddenly interrupted by Egeus who brings with him his daughter, Hermia, and her two suitors, Lysander and Demetrius. Egeus desires Demetrius to be her husband, but Hermia prefers Lysander. Theseus decides that Hermia must either accede to her fathers choice or become a nun, which causes Hermia and Lysander to elope. Lysander and Hermia are traveling through a forest, but unbeknownst to them Demetrius was following them, and Helena, who had an unreciprocated love for Demetrius, was following him. In that same forest a group of craftmen were practicing a play they hoped to put on for Theseus wedding. This crowded forest also contained the king and queen of the fairies, Oberon and Titania, were fighting over the possession of an Indian boy they kidnapped. Oberon decided to play a prank on Titania by having his jester, Robin, give her a lover potion that made her fall in love with the first thing she saw, which happened to be the most boisterous man in the play, Bottom. Robin also turned his head into that of an ass, just for fun. Oberon also had Robin use the potion on Lysander and Demetrius who now both were in love with Helena whereas before they both loved Hermia. Chaos ensues until Oberon has had enough and settles the entire debacle by keeping Demetrius in love with Helena, returning Lysander and Hermias love, and removing the love potion from Titania. The conclusion of the play consists of the entire cast mocking the play created by Bottom and the other craftsmen.

Lysander and Hermia are traveling through a forest, but unbeknownst to them Demetrius was following them, and Helena, who had an unreciprocated love for Demetrius, was following him.

Nick DevlinTuesday, April 17, 2012 at 9:26pm EDT
