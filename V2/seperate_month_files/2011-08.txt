Steph DudakMonday, August 1, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, August 1, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
Ummm 5 business days at most

Steph DudakMonday, August 1, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
Expect it in 2

Nick DevlinMonday, August 1, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
any ideas on the materials?

Nick DevlinMonday, August 1, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
so i can get ready now

Steph DudakMonday, August 1, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
Any rare metal you can get your hands on would be a good start. Power tools. Um

Steph DudakMonday, August 1, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
A forge maybe

Steph DudakMonday, August 1, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
Electrical tape

Nick DevlinMonday, August 1, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
well I could just import those from minecraft then use a 3-D printer i suppose

Nick DevlinMonday, August 1, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
been meaning to get some electrical tape anyway

Steph DudakMonday, August 1, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
You'll need to have two large antennas

Nick DevlinMonday, August 1, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
aight

Nick DevlinMonday, August 1, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
anything else?

Steph DudakMonday, August 1, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
There's other unnamed materials but they'll be included in the blueprint package

Nick DevlinMonday, August 1, 2011 at 10:58pm EDT
of course

Nick DevlinMonday, August 1, 2011 at 10:58pm EDT
can't let that kind of info get into the cloud

Steph DudakMonday, August 1, 2011 at 10:58pm EDT
Oh. And you'll need a level and a pencil

Nick DevlinMonday, August 1, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
well those are a given in any extra-dimensional transportation device

Steph DudakMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
Yeah but some people tend to forget their importance and just ignore it. *shrugs*

Nick DevlinMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
not very bright people

Nick DevlinMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
and i really need to find the italicize setup on this chat

Steph DudakMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:02pm EDT
You're telling me. But this is why we don't have things like time machines, hover cars, and other teleportation devices. People ignore the smallest, yet important things. That, and the general public wouldn't be prepared for such technology.

Steph DudakMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:02pm EDT
Any of such that exists is kept hidden for a reason

Nick DevlinMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT
well i think we pretty much forgot how to go to the moon, they had to call in one of those 90 year old guys who did it the first time, cause none of the new people knew how

Nick DevlinMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT
laziness

Steph DudakMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT
Kids these days omg

Nick DevlinMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT

clicking*

Steph DudakMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
I didn't even notice that error

Nick DevlinMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
i noticed after like a minute

Nick DevlinMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
and it bothered me

Steph DudakMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:26pm EDT
I can tell lol considering you corrected it

Nick DevlinMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT

Nick DevlinMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
Lmao. That's so annoying! I'm right here!

Steph DudakMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:34pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:35pm EDT

Nick DevlinMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:38pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:39pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:40pm EDT
I'm laying in the dark. I need to get up at a normal time tmrw

Nick DevlinMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT

Nick DevlinMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:47pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:49pm EDT
Are you serious? That's awful. And yeah I'm hopefully good enough to pass lol

Nick DevlinMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:57pm EDT

Nick DevlinMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:57pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:58pm EDT
Band camp

Nick DevlinMonday, August 1, 2011 at 11:58pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:00am EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:01am EDT
stretching is tortuous, but at least i can see doug doing worse than me

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:01am EDT
drum majors go to most colorguard practices >:D

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:01am EDT
and i suck less than some other people

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:01am EDT
so its all good

Steph DudakTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
Hahaha that sounds wonderful

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:05am EDT
even more fun now that alayna's back from ireland

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:05am EDT
watch her and doug is so awkward its frightnening

Steph DudakTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:05am EDT
Really? XD that's funny

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:06am EDT
that it is

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:11am EDT
i can't make fun of them yet though

Steph DudakTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:11am EDT
Why

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:12am EDT
right now it just feels mean

Steph DudakTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:13am EDT
XD

Steph DudakTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:14am EDT
You have a heart

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:15am EDT
lies, I have a brain

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:15am EDT
alayna is still my main source of rides home

Steph DudakTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:17am EDT
Ah. So you really have no feelings. Just some common sense. Be mean and make fun of your ride home = no more ride home.

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:17am EDT
i'm the tinman not the scarecrow in this scenario

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:17am EDT
logic!

Steph DudakTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:17am EDT
Hahahaha Yess

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:19am EDT
well maybe one day i can be mean, but in a nice enough way that its not mean

Steph DudakTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
I do that to my mom. I'll say something and real quick go "just kidding love you" and it's like nothing happened. Depending what I said beforehand.

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
hahahahaha

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:26am EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:28am EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:28am EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:28am EDT
and Alayna started going on a tirade about how stupid the discussion was

Steph DudakTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:29am EDT
Omg I wish I could've witnessed that

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 12:29am EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 9:24pm EDT
what part was bad?

Steph DudakTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 9:24pm EDT
Failed parallel parking and k turn even though I know how to k turn perfectly. And the guy was kind of a jerk aside from that

Steph DudakTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 9:25pm EDT
Apparently "ran" or "rolled through" or whatever 2 of 3 stop signs but that's bullshit bc I stopped at each one of them, just not to his liking

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 9:25pm EDT
don't worry, hopefully he'll get in a car accident because he gets a really terrible driver one day. he won't die but he'll pay a million in medical expnses :D

Steph DudakTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 9:26pm EDT
Haha that's the best response to this news I've heard all day

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 9:27pm EDT
i try

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 9:28pm EDT
i know a lot more directors than i thought i did

Steph DudakTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 9:29pm EDT
You succeed. And that's wonderful!

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 9:30pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 9:30pm EDT

Then take it again

Steph DudakTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 9:32pm EDT
And hopefully pass

Steph DudakTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 9:32pm EDT
Or cry and kill myself for failing twice

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 9:32pm EDT
i'm thinking you should avoid the latter

Steph DudakTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 9:32pm EDT
Yaknow

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 9:33pm EDT
you should never cry before killing yourself

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 9:33pm EDT
shows weakness

Steph DudakTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 9:34pm EDT
Lmfao

Steph DudakTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT
Hahah of course

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 9:57pm EDT
even though its technically correct *english* spelling

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT
as opposed to american

Steph DudakTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT
I had to stop spelling like that in my English essays

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 10:06pm EDT
do they actually correct it? i'm gonna test that next year, just use entirely british spelling and see what happens

Steph DudakTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 10:06pm EDT
Well you might be able to get away with it depending. Mr Burke was explaining to me why I wasn't supposed to do that but idr why

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 10:07pm EDT
she tried correcting my spelling of naivete so i gave her a list of like 10 alternate spelling that still count

Steph DudakTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 10:09pm EDT
Mrs Burke I'm assuming? Haha oh boy

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 10:10pm EDT
she was just like 'oh...okay'

Steph DudakTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 10:13pm EDT
XD

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 10:15pm EDT
i was expecting a bit more, she also didn't correct me anymore after that

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 10:15pm EDT
i was kinda disapponited, i like telling teachers they're wrong

Steph DudakTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 10:24pm EDT
I believe it

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 10:25pm EDT
mary went to a god damn special effects makeup class for sail, i am annoyed

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 10:25pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
/:

Steph DudakTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 10:36pm EDT
I don't want to. But the possible yet slim chance of college credit is keeping me from switching out

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 2, 2011 at 10:36pm EDT
bleh

Steph DudakWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 1:05am EDT
I will not include a self-destruct mechanism unless absolutely necessary. If it is necessary, it will not be a large red button labelled "Danger: Do Not Push". The big red button marked "Do Not Push" will instead trigger a spray of bullets on anyone stupid enough to disregard it. Similarly, the ON/OFF switch will not clearly be labelled as such.

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 1:06am EDT
love that one

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 1:06am EDT
All bumbling conjurers, clumsy squires, no-talent bards, and cowardly thieves in the land will be preemptively put to death. My foes will surely give up and abandon their quest if they have no source of comic relief.

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 1:06am EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 1:12am EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 1:12am EDT
If I'm wearing the key to the hero's shackles around my neck and his former girlfriend now volunteers to become my mistress and we are all alone in my bedchamber on my bed and she offers me a goblet of wine, I will politely decline the offer.

Steph DudakWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
You gotta get one then

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
they're just so hard to find nowadays

Steph DudakWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 11:30pm EDT
Yeah and it's hard to find people that can make em too

Steph DudakWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 11:31pm EDT
You go to a store and ask for some plate boots and they look at you like you have two heads and some tentacles.

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
and then when you ask about the emerald and jade engraving

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
they just stop listening

Steph DudakWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 11:34pm EDT
Ugh I know! It's ridiculous. And never mind trying to find a quality sword.

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 11:34pm EDT
i mean is it so difficult to sell swords that won't break when used to hack off limbs?

Steph DudakWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 11:37pm EDT
Right? Oh what can you do. I should pick up blacksmithing

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 11:39pm EDT
you totally should

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 11:40pm EDT
i'd buy your stuff, i wonder where you'd go to learn that

Steph DudakWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
Somewhere high in the mountains, in a hidden temple where an old, wise warrior resides

Steph DudakWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
Guarded by a dragon, which you need to pass without killing

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
that's one plave

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
good, i lyke dragons

Steph DudakWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
And you may only entre the temple if you are worthy enough.

Steph DudakWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 11:43pm EDT
Actually, you may pass the dragon if you're worthy enough. That's the first step.

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 11:43pm EDT
man medieval times must have sucked, if you had to do all that just to get a job

Steph DudakWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 11:45pm EDT
Well that's nowadays

Steph DudakWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 11:45pm EDT
Not just anyone can be a blacksmith cause theyve all died out obvi

Steph DudakWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 11:46pm EDT
One of the few left has to be heavily protected of course.

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 3, 2011 at 11:46pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, August 4, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, August 4, 2011 at 11:49pm EDT

Schrodinger's cat walks into a bar

Nick DevlinThursday, August 4, 2011 at 11:57pm EDT
and doesn't

Nick DevlinThursday, August 4, 2011 at 11:58pm EDT
:D

Steph DudakThursday, August 4, 2011 at 11:59pm EDT
got me there lol

Nick DevlinFriday, August 5, 2011 at 12:00am EDT
Schrodinger's cat is the explanation used to describe how elemental particles are affected by someone watching them, until they are viewed, the particle is both possible outcomes simultaneously

Nick DevlinFriday, August 5, 2011 at 12:01am EDT
so if a cat was in a box with a poisonous gas that would be released if a random event occured, then the cat would be both dead and alive untl someone opened the box to see if the gas was released or not

Steph DudakFriday, August 5, 2011 at 12:03am EDT
ahh i gotcha

Nick DevlinFriday, August 5, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
i suppose i could have made the joke better by saying Schrodinger's cat walks into a bar *when no one's looking* and doesn't

Nick DevlinFriday, August 5, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
that would have made it better I think

Nick DevlinFriday, August 5, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
oh well

Steph DudakFriday, August 5, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
yeah probably lol at least you know for next time

Nick DevlinFriday, August 5, 2011 at 12:25am EDT

Steph DudakFriday, August 5, 2011 at 12:27am EDT

Steph DudakFriday, August 5, 2011 at 12:27am EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, August 5, 2011 at 12:27am EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, August 5, 2011 at 12:27am EDT
this is just a temp map

Nick DevlinFriday, August 5, 2011 at 12:28am EDT
so no one really does much on server until we get a permanent one

There's a section that says "Ask". Check off the box that says "Let people ask questions". And if you want, also check off "Allow anonymous questions" or whatever. And your askbox link will be motivatedsloth.tumblr.com/ask automatically.

Steph DudakSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:31pm EDT
maybe

Steph DudakSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:31pm EDT
doing things like that when you have an html code as your theme is easiest imo

Steph DudakSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:32pm EDT
i meant to get around to doing things like that

Steph DudakSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:32pm EDT
maybe one day. not today lol

Nick DevlinSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:32pm EDT
I got bored and felt like trying it out

Nick DevlinSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:33pm EDT
as opposed to doing my java homework, which is pretty much exactly what I'm doing right now -_-

Steph DudakSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:33pm EDT
do your hw!

Steph DudakSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:33pm EDT
i still gotta do my assignments...

Steph DudakSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:33pm EDT
i might as well do the book review for animal farm today.. maybe

Nick DevlinSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:33pm EDT
what does the book review entail?

Steph DudakSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:34pm EDT
yaknow. main, minor characters. setting, plot, blahblahbahblah

Steph DudakSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:34pm EDT
i haven't looked at the paper in weeks so

Steph DudakSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:34pm EDT
i don't know

Steph DudakSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:36pm EDT
what else is on there

Nick DevlinSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:37pm EDT
boring

Nick DevlinSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:39pm EDT
you'd think ap would go more in-depth

Steph DudakSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:40pm EDT
Well

Steph DudakSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:40pm EDT
Hold on

Nick DevlinSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:42pm EDT
holding

Steph DudakSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:43pm EDT
No actually that's pretty much it lol. Title, author, setting (time, place, socio-economics, significant historical events), major characters, minor characters, plot summary (just hit the highlights which will help you recall needed aspects). And central conflict - internal or external

Steph DudakSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:43pm EDT
Then in sept we need to be prepared to do like. A cull analysis o. Em or somethin

Nick DevlinSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:43pm EDT
...seriously?

Steph DudakSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:43pm EDT
I fucking hate typing on my ipod

Nick DevlinSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:44pm EDT
facebook says your on your computer

Steph DudakSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:44pm EDT

Nick DevlinSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:45pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:46pm EDT
She most likely is offline on chat lol

Steph DudakSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:46pm EDT
I'm doing catcher in the rye for my second book

Steph DudakSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:47pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:47pm EDT
But idk lol

Nick DevlinSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:48pm EDT
well I didn't see much else cool on that list

Steph DudakSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:49pm EDT
There wasn't anything >.<

Nick DevlinSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:57pm EDT
damn it tumblr

Nick DevlinSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:58pm EDT

Nick DevlinSaturday, August 20, 2011 at 4:58pm EDT

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:40pm EDT
I am critiquing klems new song

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT
yeah there's like a million questions. i'm being occupied. how's that goin?

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
i told him about a couple jarring notes, said the violin sounded a bit off and that the end was amazing.

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:45pm EDT

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
I noticed you jacked my 30 day challenge

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
i did! lol

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
i wanted to do another one, but i felt like doing a second WoW 30 day challenge would be a little much

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
and it seemed interesting enough

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
I gave up on finishing my anime one

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
XD

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
some of those are interesting

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
I just don't feel like researching each question, so I don't mess up names and whatnot. I have like 3 Fairy Tail based tumblrs following me -_-

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT
oh goodness .-.

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
i don't even know where half my followers come from. idk why i have followers really lol. all my tumblr is, is the reblogging of WoW related things, kittens, and architecture. and then random things i find funny.

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
replace WoW with pokemon and you got my tumblr

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
i think a lot are just follow me i follow you type of things

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
yeah i definitely have a bunch of those.

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
that's kinda lame though lol

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
how many followers you even got?

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
have*

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
no clue why that even bothered me

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
hahaha. i have 83

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
damn

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
out of that, are a couple people i knew online before tumblr (so thats why theyre following me/i'm following them)

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
then theres you, kristyn, laurie, ian, steffanie weiss, and julia...

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
julia?

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
esposito

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
oh.

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
haha that girl hates me

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
i used to be best friends with her in 7th grade lol

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
then a good portion are people that play WoW, and some other random people

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:58pm EDT
almost 1/3 of my followers actually know me.

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:58pm EDT
damn band camp

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:58pm EDT
i prefer people that don't know me

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:58pm EDT
just because when people know you, it's like.

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:58pm EDT
idk. i feel like i need to watch what i say you know?

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:58pm EDT
Yeah I know

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
But it depends on the people

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
oh well yeah

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
certain people idc

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
but then there's others that it's like.. whhhhy

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
i don't have any people like that :D

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
Mostly because they all have much worse problems then I do and nothing I say could really be that embarrassing

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
like half of the kids in band have depression I think

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
i wouldn't doubt it o.o

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
that's also kind of scary, and quite depressing as well

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
I know!

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:02pm EDT
And now I gotta comment on all their depressing status updates, making bad jokes!

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:02pm EDT
I'm just too nice

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:04pm EDT
>.<

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:04pm EDT
well you don't HAVE to XD. but it is good to try to make people feel better about themselves

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:04pm EDT
the only issue with that though, is that they don't care and are like WAH I SUCK I'M WORTHLESS WAH HATE MY LIFE RAWR

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:04pm EDT
and then i'm like.

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:04pm EDT
._.

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:05pm EDT
after giving them like a 5 minute speech about how awesome and not worthless they are. and theyre like. yeah. BUT I SUCK

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:05pm EDT
pretty much that

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:05pm EDT
i gave up that route I think

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
I just self reference the situation the bring up a random topic to distract them now. Hopefully just having a normal discussion can make them forget about depressing shit

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
yeah that's true

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:07pm EDT
but what's worse is when they bring it up first. it's like oh, hello to you too. my day was fine, thanks. how was yours?

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:07pm EDT
yep thats one of the annoying ones

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:08pm EDT
I aso dislike the trying to hide it, but its soo obvious you want attention one

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:08pm EDT
its worse when they actually do have a problem as well

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:10pm EDT
Ugh yes! Exactlyyy. I just can't handle it sometimes

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:10pm EDT
Remember ashley in chem?

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
Most antisocial person ever. And she posted that she will not talk to anyone tomorrow

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
Yess

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:12pm EDT
so I must now make it my job to talk to her all day about random stuff

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:12pm EDT
I'm thinking My Little Pony will be a big part of it

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:13pm EDT
Oh goodness

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:13pm EDT
Good luck. But don't shove MLP down her throat lol

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:13pm EDT
I'll just keep referencing in most likely

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
like you remind me of Twilight Sparkle when Princess Celestia first sent her to Ponyville.

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
How exactly? Haha

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
Ahh

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
you switch to ipod?

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:16pm EDT
Yes ._.

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:16pm EDT
I will type slower

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT
Thanks XD. Facebook is awful on my iPod like I can't. I have to reply in the actual messages section bc sometimes in chat it doesn't send everything so

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
I got a facebook messenger app that works a bit better but is still finniky

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
The tumblr app can be kinda lame too sometimes. Like when I'm scrolling through a few hrs worth of posts on my dash and it crashes lol.

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
the tumblr app sucks, I can't see pictures after a hundred or so images, the won't load, and I can't refresh to that point in the list of pics.

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
Seriously? That's lame .-.

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
I need a wider vocabulary

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
I never use it

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
Or a nap

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
I just used "lame" quite a few tines

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
thesaurus app on my ipod works fine though

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
Times *

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
i use awesome all the tine

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:26pm EDT

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:26pm EDT

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:26pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
I didn't make it XD I just filled it out

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
It kept me busy for a bit

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
Some answers are entertaining

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
Nope they were on shuffle

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:30pm EDT
Sing plays, put it down for an answer. Press next and repeat

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:30pm EDT
Song*

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:30pm EDT
yeppp

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:31pm EDT
i'm less impressed, but still thats a lot of songs to type, I would have given up at like 20

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
Well thats what makes it entertaining

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
Having em on shuffle

Nick DevlinMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
I know you can turn autocorrect off though

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:46pm EDT
Yeah but then everything would just be terrible

Steph DudakMonday, August 22, 2011 at 11:46pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:22am EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
But no

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
:(

Steph DudakTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
It's just a pathway and trees in Cattus Island

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:22am EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:22am EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:23am EDT
Acryllic paint

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:24am EDT
thats sorta fun

Steph DudakTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:24am EDT
Kinda. It doesn't look very good right now but it's gettin there lol

Steph DudakTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
Still gotta add all the leaves to the trees and stuff

Steph DudakTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
Do the grass

Steph DudakTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
Etc

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:26am EDT
ugg leaves i can't do anything with leaves. I usually just make it winter.

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:26am EDT
but it sounds amusing, better than like a glass of water

Steph DudakTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:27am EDT
Definitely. And it's fun when you're right there painting it. Rather than doing it from a picture or something.

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:28am EDT
seems like it would be.

Steph DudakTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:30am EDT
It is. And it was nice out today so it was good

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:30am EDT
Well I imagine doing it in the rain would be difficult, so glad it was nice out

Steph DudakTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:32am EDT
Unless I sat in a chair under a really big unbrella

Steph DudakTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:32am EDT
Umbrella*

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:33am EDT
or you could like build a shack with a giant glass wall

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:33am EDT
that would be easier in my opiniong

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:33am EDT
opinion*8

Steph DudakTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:33am EDT
That'd be really awesome

Steph DudakTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:34am EDT
Or well a greenhouse, Thats basically an office

Steph DudakTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:34am EDT
Like outside in a garden or something in back of a house

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:34am EDT
a porach with glass walls

Steph DudakTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:34am EDT
When it's nice out just work in there. Paint or draw or do other work

Steph DudakTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:34am EDT
Yeaaah

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:34am EDT
...porch*

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:35am EDT
Probably easier than trying to do it with a computer next to you, tempting you.

Steph DudakTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:35am EDT
I think imma do that when I'm older

Steph DudakTuesday, August 23, 2011 at 12:35am EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, August 24, 2011 at 11:08pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 24, 2011 at 11:08pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 24, 2011 at 11:12pm EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, August 24, 2011 at 11:13pm EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, August 24, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
THIS ISN'T WORKING

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 24, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
Maybe its a sign to lay off WoW for a while

Steph DudakWednesday, August 24, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
it's not lol. it's not crucial to gameplay at all

Steph DudakWednesday, August 24, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
all it is

Steph DudakWednesday, August 24, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT
is the clock, (which when you click then opens the calendar), friends online, guild members online, fps latency, etc

Steph DudakWednesday, August 24, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT
i need something to keep me busy yo

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 24, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, August 24, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
lmao

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 24, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
yeah i figured out it was pretty much just a thing to make the game more convenient in mah googling

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 24, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
still though i think you play WoW more than I do minecraft stuff

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 24, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
which is probably bad

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 24, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
just sayin

Steph DudakWednesday, August 24, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
i probably do but i know how to control how much time i spend playing

Steph DudakWednesday, August 24, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
i have a lot of time on my hands right now

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 24, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, August 24, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 24, 2011 at 11:26pm EDT
then sleeping the other 12

Steph DudakWednesday, August 24, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, August 25, 2011 at 12:27am EDT

Steph DudakThursday, August 25, 2011 at 12:27am EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, August 25, 2011 at 12:28am EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, August 26, 2011 at 2:56pm EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, August 26, 2011 at 2:58pm EDT
and cause they have like no commercials

Nick DevlinFriday, August 26, 2011 at 2:59pm EDT

Steph DudakFriday, August 26, 2011 at 2:59pm EDT

Steph DudakFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:01pm EDT
like i was going through channels once and stopped on a spanish channel and they were talking so fast but they were all like YEAH SPANISH IMMAPSEAKAMILLIONMILESAMINUTE. and i was like wtf is this. turned out to be a condom commercial. but not like a trojan commercial or anything. and the only reason i figured it out was because of some cognates and yeah. trying to watch spanish television isn't good though since i can never even slightly understand

Steph DudakFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:01pm EDT
like those spanish talk shows and stuff

Steph DudakFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:01pm EDT
oh man

Nick DevlinFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:02pm EDT
yep, people always says its just becaue you don't understand the language

Nick DevlinFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:02pm EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:02pm EDT
i hear people that actually speak spanish talk

Nick DevlinFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:02pm EDT
they talk normally

Steph DudakFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:02pm EDT
some of them talk fast though. not as fast as tv

Steph DudakFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:02pm EDT
but fast enough

Nick DevlinFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:02pm EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:12pm EDT
My daily consumptions is aon average 30-50 videos a day

Nick DevlinFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:13pm EDT
these videos link to other video which link to other ones

Steph DudakFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:13pm EDT
ahh of course

Steph DudakFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:13pm EDT
a neverending chain

Steph DudakFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:13pm EDT
i don't even subscribe to enough people on youtube to watch that many

Nick DevlinFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:13pm EDT
exactly it doesn't help when some videos are just people listing other videos I should watch, which like exponentially increases the damn chani

Steph DudakFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:15pm EDT
lately i've only been bothering to watch very few things. i recently picked up on http://youtu.be/NOmoWVbhWiU this. i don't even have plans to play this game, but i enjoy watching this guy play *insert any of the thousand games he plays* because it's quite amusing

Nick DevlinFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:15pm EDT
oh let's plays

Nick DevlinFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:16pm EDT
those are like 20% of the videos I watch

Steph DudakFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:16pm EDT
i will basically watch anything jesse records. it's pretty bad

Nick DevlinFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:16pm EDT
i know the problem

Steph DudakFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:17pm EDT
the only issue is most of his videos are like

Steph DudakFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:17pm EDT
20+ minutes

Steph DudakFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:18pm EDT
cause it's all gaming lol. but i will waste all that time watching them

Nick DevlinFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:18pm EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:35pm EDT

Steph DudakFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:37pm EDT
It's okay. I mean it could be worse

Nick DevlinFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:37pm EDT
i could watch reality tv

Steph DudakFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:37pm EDT
You could be like extremely addicted to crack. Or heroin. Or both.

Nick DevlinFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:37pm EDT
i think the reality tv might be worse

Steph DudakFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:39pm EDT
Probably

Steph DudakFriday, August 26, 2011 at 3:40pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, August 27, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT
most of the time

Steph DudakSaturday, August 27, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT
zuko, sokka, and toph are my favourites

Nick DevlinSaturday, August 27, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
yeah i think katara is meant to be a bit annoying, aang i don't mind

Nick DevlinSaturday, August 27, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
toph is amazing

Nick DevlinSaturday, August 27, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
sokka is hilarious

Nick DevlinSaturday, August 27, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
zuko just kept getting better

Nick DevlinSaturday, August 27, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, August 27, 2011 at 9:57pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:49pm EDT
I might just google most of the book stuff and then skim the book

Nick DevlinSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:49pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:49pm EDT
and do that as well

Steph DudakSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:51pm EDT
I feel like dropping AP lit more and more each day

Nick DevlinSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:51pm EDT
i fwlt it the same day she shoved me in that room when I was walking by

Nick DevlinSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:51pm EDT
and so I did

Nick DevlinSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:51pm EDT
before I even handed paper in

Steph DudakSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:52pm EDT
I mean AP lit isn't really essential to my future

Nick DevlinSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:52pm EDT
in any way

Steph DudakSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:53pm EDT
And

Steph DudakSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:53pm EDT
It's really just the no final thing. But I mean. Idk

Nick DevlinSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:53pm EDT
is it worth a year in a class you hate?

Steph DudakSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:53pm EDT
Maybe English 4 or world lit would be better

Nick DevlinSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:54pm EDT
do world lit, you might get in my awesome class

Steph DudakSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:54pm EDT
Well that's the thing idk if I'll hate it

Steph DudakSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:54pm EDT
But then again, Ik it won't be like mr burkes

Steph DudakSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:54pm EDT
On the upside

Steph DudakSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:55pm EDT
I won't need to learn this vocabulary if I do so

Nick DevlinSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:56pm EDT
i wouldn't mind the vocab as much

Nick DevlinSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:56pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:56pm EDT
choices*

Nick DevlinSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:56pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:56pm EDT
You're pretty good with vocabulary though lol

Steph DudakSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:57pm EDT
I'm alright to an extent

Nick DevlinSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:57pm EDT
I know! I asked fo the vocab test my english teacher never gave us

Nick DevlinSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:57pm EDT
because we stopped learning vocab halfway through the year

Nick DevlinSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:57pm EDT
I bot like B+ without having ever looked at word list :D

Nick DevlinSunday, August 28, 2011 at 7:59pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, August 28, 2011 at 8:00pm EDT
Haha aww. You should've gotten extra credit or somethin

Nick DevlinSunday, August 28, 2011 at 8:01pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, August 28, 2011 at 8:04pm EDT
Hahaha great idea

Steph DudakSunday, August 28, 2011 at 8:07pm EDT
OK SO FINAL DECISION. Switching from AP lit to world lit. I feel like I should do that before school actually starts

Nick DevlinSunday, August 28, 2011 at 8:08pm EDT
might be a good idea

Nick DevlinSunday, August 28, 2011 at 8:08pm EDT
that way you don't have to look at the teacher and feel guilty when there are like 3 kids in the class

Steph DudakSunday, August 28, 2011 at 8:12pm EDT
Haha omg right.

Steph DudakSunday, August 28, 2011 at 8:12pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, August 28, 2011 at 8:12pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, August 30, 2011 at 4:40pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 30, 2011 at 4:40pm EDT
problem solved

Steph DudakTuesday, August 30, 2011 at 4:41pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 30, 2011 at 4:41pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 30, 2011 at 4:41pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 30, 2011 at 4:41pm EDT
i bet no one else can see it

Steph DudakTuesday, August 30, 2011 at 4:41pm EDT
i bet you're right .-.

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 30, 2011 at 4:42pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 30, 2011 at 4:42pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, August 30, 2011 at 4:42pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, August 30, 2011 at 4:42pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 12:12am EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 12:39am EDT
the assignments are pretty specific

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 12:39am EDT
hold on im gonna try to send you it

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 12:40am EDT
	Complete a work that features a subject in a dramatic light. The subject should be in a context and design elements and composition should be considered. 	Create an artwork that is in service of a ritual of that has personal significance. This artwork can be based on a ritual that is overtly or covertly significant. Clipping toenails may be as significant to some as the marriage is to others. It is your task to establish this significance. Explore all aspects suggested by the word RITUAL (e.g. routine, time, chronology, spiritual, etc.). These elements should be evident in the work if it is to truly read as a significant ritual. There are no material restrictions; students should choose a material and scale that best brings the viewer to their ritual.

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 12:40am EDT
	Enlarge and magnify a metallic object: Zero in on a section of metallic objects, such as a close-up of part of a bike or motorcycle, or forks and spoons. Make use of hardedge metal reflections and cast shadows. 	Do a self-portrait that expresses a specific mood. Think about the effects of color and how its use can help convey the individual mood. You might want to do several studies, reflecting different moods. 	Combine a manufactured object and a natural object (ex. an apple and a thumb tack). Show how the newly created object is useful or useless. Use any choice of media.

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 12:40am EDT
	Render or model (using wire, wood or clay) a figure group in their environment. 	Design or fashion a mask from your own cultural background. 	Make three objects whose forms are related but different from each other. 	Large Landscape: minimum size 18 x 24. The landscape must show depth and distance. The landscape can be done from any angle. Overlapping and repetition helps to create a sense of depth and distance. Emphasize dark and light shapes, textures, and space. Create strong contrasts and do not use outlines in nature! The landscape must be done in color in any choice of media including paint, collage or mixed media. The landscape must be done on a flat, smooth, 2-dimensional surface. All landscapes must have a foreground, middle ground and background. Lighting is very important and should be dramatic.

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 12:40am EDT
	Masterpieces re-visited, reworked and given a distinctly 60s flair. Try a mixed media technique and be creative. Research the style of the 1960s, the clothes, the culture, the music, etc. 	Find and research two artists whose work you find interesting. In your journal or sketchbook, describe their media and techniques and the problem they explore in their work.

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 12:40am EDT
and i need to do three outta this list

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 12:43am EDT
That actually looks fun. I like the non 2-d stuff a lot

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 12:43am EDT
But of course you pick the project with the longest description

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 12:43am EDT
lmao

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 12:44am EDT
idk what others to do!

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 12:44am EDT
i was thiiinking

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 12:44am EDT
the combine a manufactured/natural object

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 12:44am EDT
annd self portrait without showing likeness

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 12:47am EDT
They sound cool. You should totally do the plastic wrapped bananas for the manufactured/ nature one.

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 12:49am EDT
And make your mood for the self portrait as like victorious. Like you slaying a dragon or getting an A on some test

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 12:51am EDT
dkhhrsl that'd be awesome lol. both of those XD

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 12:51am EDT
plastic wrapped banana aaah

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 12:54am EDT
I can do ideas, just not the transfer into reality.

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 12:54am EDT
Which is pretty much definition of art I think

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 12:55am EDT
basically haha. if you could just apply those ideas you'd be unstoppable. then again, you can do that in plenty of ways

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 1:02am EDT
Such as? Finger paint :D??

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 1:06am EDT
No wait! Macaroni art!!

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 1:07am EDT
Or maybe pipe cleaners could be utilized

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 1:07am EDT
YES

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 1:07am EDT
all of it

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 1:10am EDT
I'll do it while procrastinating my homework tomorrow

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 1:11am EDT
i expect to see the outcome

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 1:12am EDT
Well now that it is assigned it might take a few weeks longer but I'll do it eventually

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 1:17am EDT
Once I locate paint and macaroni and pipe cleaners

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 1:22am EDT
you can get those anywhere psht

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 1:23am EDT
Except my house. We probly had them like stockpiled until I decided that I wanted to use them tonight

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 1:24am EDT
Once I look for them tomorrow I'll discover a thief has stolen those 3 things and the glue but left everything else untouched

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 1:28am EDT
Yep my iPod has 3 minutes left I'm guessing, and my eyes have like 1

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 1:29am EDT
Talk to ya later!

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 1:43am EDT
byee goodnight!

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 2:43pm EDT
so how much java do you know?

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 2:59pm EDT
I never really got into java /:

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 3:04pm EDT
yeah neither did i

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 3:07pm EDT
which is a bit of a problem

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 3:12pm EDT
What exactly is your assignment

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 3:13pm EDT
i have this worksheet

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 3:13pm EDT
its mostly filling in charts

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 3:13pm EDT
But I am still trying to figure out what all these words mean

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 3:17pm EDT
what words lol

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 3:18pm EDT
...

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 3:18pm EDT
let me copy the first paragraph

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 3:20pm EDT
alllrighty

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 3:22pm EDT
In chapter 1, we put all of our code in the main() method. That's not exactly object-oriented. In fact that's not object-oriented at all. Well we did use a few objects like the String arrays for the Phrase-o-matic, but we didn't actually develop any of our own object types. So now we've got to leave that procedural world behind, get the heck out of main(), and start makingsome objects of our own. We'll look at what makes object-oriented (OO) development so much fun. We''l look at the difference between and object and a class... Yeah that's all I'm writing

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 3:22pm EDT
I still didn't even finish writing the rest of the first paragraph

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 3:28pm EDT
oh my goodness

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 3:29pm EDT
whats eve worse is that guard practice started half an hour ago

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 3:29pm EDT
well i feel like all that is something you'd know if you took whatever class it is that you took lol

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 3:29pm EDT
i know right!

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 3:29pm EDT
are you not going then?

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 3:29pm EDT
how am supposed to know this stuff

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 3:29pm EDT
I'm running is what i'm doing

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 3:30pm EDT
talk to ya whenever i get back which might be never

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 3:30pm EDT
sara's gonna be pissd

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 3:30pm EDT
good luck!

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 3:30pm EDT
be careful, don't get yourself killed, etc

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 3:32pm EDT
i'll try

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 6:57pm EDT
i didn't die

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 6:57pm EDT
almost passed out

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 6:57pm EDT
but didnt die

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:07pm EDT
O.o

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:07pm EDT
At least you're alive!

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:07pm EDT
That's always good

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:07pm EDT
:D

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:07pm EDT
i know!

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:12pm EDT
This art thing is turning out to be real awful. I have 0 inspiration idk what I'm gonna do

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:12pm EDT
for which project?

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:13pm EDT
All of them

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:14pm EDT
-.-

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:14pm EDT
well the nature thing isn't that hard

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:15pm EDT
what can you thing of that is completely useless?

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:15pm EDT
I already did the landscape

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:15pm EDT
manufactured/ nature

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:15pm EDT
not the landscape

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:15pm EDT
Oh yeah well that's the thing

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:16pm EDT
There's tons of things thatd be completely useless but I dont wanna just combine two random things

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:17pm EDT
Like oh here's an apple attached to a gold chain. It's a necklace that eventually rots away

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:17pm EDT
But then again that is basically what that is

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:17pm EDT
But I want to think of something not so lame

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:17pm EDT
i was thinking more along the lines of something people invented that is not necessary because it already esists in nature

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:18pm EDT
like bottled water

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:18pm EDT
cause, you know, we had water

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:19pm EDT
Yeah that exists though

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:20pm EDT
I can't just bring in or draw a bottle of water. The assignment is to combine two things yourself and show if it's useful or nit

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:20pm EDT
Not*

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:20pm EDT
yeah so draw a bunch of empty wter bottles clogging a stream

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:20pm EDT
bam

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:20pm EDT
done

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:22pm EDT
owait

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:22pm EDT
like real stuff?

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:22pm EDT
thats still doable

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:23pm EDT
but more difficult

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:24pm EDT
umm

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:25pm EDT
i completely misunderstood the assignment

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:26pm EDT
you have to combine two things in order to make a new item?

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:26pm EDT
I thought you were just contrating manufactured and natural things

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:26pm EDT
Combine a natural and manufactured object. The example was an apple and a thumbtack

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:26pm EDT
Basically

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:33pm EDT
so thats kinda stupid actually i dont like it as much

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:34pm EDT
blegh i can't even think of anything for that

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:35pm EDT
just do the drawing i said

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:35pm EDT
much better

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:38pm EDT
but yeah i can only think of stupid ideas for the maubfactured thing

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:42pm EDT
unless you allowed to make weapons

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:42pm EDT
in which case i can think of tons of iseas for some reason

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:45pm EDT
Well if said weapons include a natural stuff

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:46pm EDT
Like a sword covered in vines

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:46pm EDT
Or a gun that shoots out acorns

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:47pm EDT
kinda stuff like tahat, yeah

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:52pm EDT
but i dont think a weapon would go over too well

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:54pm EDT
Wellll

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:56pm EDT
Idk the fact that itd be rendered useless

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:56pm EDT
It'd only be drawn lol

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:56pm EDT
And if it's a useless weapon

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:56pm EDT
Then yaknow

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:56pm EDT
Orrrr yaknow

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:57pm EDT
ohhhh maybe you combine a weapon with something from nature in order to make it worthless

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:57pm EDT
have like a stop the violence message

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:57pm EDT
Like a sword with the blade made out of twigs and leaves. It's basically a giant stick with a hilt

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:57pm EDT
Yeah that too

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:58pm EDT
so either having an awesome weapon

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:59pm EDT
or having a useless weapon

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:59pm EDT
the awesome would probably be more fun to draw

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:59pm EDT
and you could just copy something from WoW probably, or at least the style

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 7:59pm EDT
and the useless might get more points for having a message or something

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:00pm EDT
omg ready

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:00pm EDT
there's this sword actually

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:00pm EDT
imma show you it

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:00pm EDT
funfun

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:01pm EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:02pm EDT
i think it looks pretty bad ass

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:02pm EDT
haha awesome

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:02pm EDT
whats natural about?

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:02pm EDT
besides that it is green

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:03pm EDT
theres nothing natural about it. it's a normal sword. but the thing would be combining something like that with something natural.

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:03pm EDT
a sword on fire o:

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:03pm EDT
hahaahah

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:03pm EDT
owait!!

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:04pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:06pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:06pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:08pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:15pm EDT
and there isn't much weird stuff in this video :D

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:16pm EDT
O.O

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:16pm EDT
that's so cool!

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:16pm EDT
i know!

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:17pm EDT
it might be a bit hard to draw though...

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:18pm EDT
i just thought it was awesome

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:18pm EDT
it is awesome asdjkhflh

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:18pm EDT
hmmm

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:18pm EDT
well i guess i've decided i'm going to be drawing a sword lol

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:18pm EDT
yay!

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:18pm EDT
at least that parts out of the way

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:19pm EDT
now comes the final decision to make it useless or not useless

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:19pm EDT
i guess i should make it useless

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:19pm EDT
just because if i did do some sort of flaming sword, i'd probably get a weird reaction

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:19pm EDT
hmm maybe a better idea would be to make it useful, but in a helpful way

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:19pm EDT
like making something bad work in a good way

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:19pm EDT
"so how is this useful?" 'you can kill your enemies faster. when slicing them apart with a sword isn't good enough, they'll be set on fire as well!' sooo

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:20pm EDT
no clue how you'd do that though

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:20pm EDT
YEAHH

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:20pm EDT
but how hm

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:20pm EDT
well wait

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:20pm EDT
i'm assuming this doesn't need to be realistic right. since it's combining a natural and manufactured item

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:21pm EDT
idk where i'm really going with that i guess i just wanted to point tha tout

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:21pm EDT
that out *

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
i'm trying to think of anything good

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
not just something

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
that a sword can do

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
but i can't

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
i don't think there's anyway to make it heal someone

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
O.O

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
maybe some way to make it build

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
ACTUALLY

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
well actually

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
??!

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:22pm EDT
that's where the non-realistic nonsense comes in.

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:23pm EDT
so nevermind

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:23pm EDT
here we go, gonna nerd real quick

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:23pm EDT
funfun

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:23pm EDT
more funfun

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:23pm EDT
in WoW, i have a sword for my tanking spec. it has an enchant that on melee attacks, it has a chance to heal you

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:23pm EDT
and the enchant is all green and there's like leaves and stuff flowing from it

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:23pm EDT
its really awesome looking

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:23pm EDT
especially since the swords green

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:24pm EDT
but in a real world sense, leaves on a sword would not heal you when you start chopping away at something with it sooo

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:24pm EDT
yeah every time i think healing, it involves magic

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:24pm EDT
which isn't really nature

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:25pm EDT
exactly /:

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:25pm EDT
lol a sword with a bandage compartment

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:25pm EDT
hahaha

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:27pm EDT
actually...

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:27pm EDT
that show has a guy who has a healing sword

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:27pm EDT
if anyone touches it thir pain is drained away

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:27pm EDT
and the energy can be blasted at enemies

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:27pm EDT
but that is of no use either

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:27pm EDT
bleghhghg

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:28pm EDT
all right healing won't work

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:28pm EDT
unless i make a bandage compartment

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:28pm EDT
which is slightly lame

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:28pm EDT
BUT

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:28pm EDT
i will keep that one in the back of my mind if nothing else comes up

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:28pm EDT
oh wait

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:28pm EDT
no

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:28pm EDT
scratch that

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:29pm EDT
bandages are not natural.

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:29pm EDT
hm

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:30pm EDT
what else is good

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:31pm EDT
ohhh maybe you could make a sword that you can make art with

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:31pm EDT
like using smooshed berries at the tip

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:31pm EDT
or something random like that

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:31pm EDT
hehe smooshed

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:32pm EDT
or like carving wood

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:36pm EDT
meeh

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:36pm EDT
idk

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:37pm EDT
what else are good things?

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:37pm EDT
building?

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:37pm EDT
creating?

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:37pm EDT
generally yes

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:38pm EDT
how can you make a sword do those things?

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:39pm EDT
swords destroy those things

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:39pm EDT
yeah, thats why the whole making it do the opposite is awesome

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:42pm EDT
the only thing i can think of would be like a fallen tree or something, then it got hacked into a sculpture of some kind

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:43pm EDT
you'd just have a wooden statue with the sword sticking in it in a forest with a bucnh of wood shavings everywhere

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:43pm EDT
but that sounds difficult

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:43pm EDT
and your're not really combining them

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:43pm EDT
just using the sword with nature

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:43pm EDT
this is hard

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:45pm EDT
well i don't HAVE to do a sword of course

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:45pm EDT
5id just like to

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:45pm EDT
id*

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:45pm EDT
but the only thing i can think of

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:45pm EDT
is replacing the blade

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:46pm EDT
or setting it on fire or something. thats natural right? fire sure

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:46pm EDT
oh wait

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:46pm EDT
didn't it say to make it useful or useless?

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:46pm EDT
lighting it on fire would make it more useful

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:46pm EDT
to kill people i suppose

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:46pm EDT
but that's no good

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:46pm EDT
its still useful

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:47pm EDT
lol

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:47pm EDT
i mean it is art

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:47pm EDT
i think what i can do is do that one,

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:47pm EDT
bt then do a second one

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:47pm EDT
in case that's like "unacceptable"

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:47pm EDT
THAT'S IT.

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:47pm EDT
i don't think she'd bug on me. she shouldn't. i'm being creative

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:47pm EDT
andit's not like im making a model of the sword

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:48pm EDT
version one will be a sword with the blade on fire. version two will be a sword ACTUALLY. thats like. the blade will go from metal to a bunch of leaves and stuff

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:48pm EDT
so like

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:48pm EDT
well vines and twigs attaching to the metal part

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:48pm EDT
so if its used, i mean. you won't really be able to. it'll just be all bendy

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:51pm EDT
then you'd just make up some story about how nature could aid or hinder objects

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:51pm EDT
and your done

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
you could make a kind of reflection on the same page, vines on one side fire on the other

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
genius

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
omg

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
asjkgdhjg

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
that's such a good idea

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
now you have to like draw it, which is where i am of much less use

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
yeah but now i have all these ideas!

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
:D

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
you're wonderful lol omg this was so helpful

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:54pm EDT
you even got to draw a sword in the end

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:54pm EDT
happy to help

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:54pm EDT
:D

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:54pm EDT
and then i just gotta do a third project and i'm done o.o

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:55pm EDT
i was just wondering if i should remind you that you had another one

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:55pm EDT
but i didn't have to

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:55pm EDT
you picked the self potrait for that one right?

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
yeah. without showing likeness

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
i could do that

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
i was actually thinking about it

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
like i don't have to even be in it

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
so then i was thinking about stuff i like and whatnot yaknow

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
just draw a tree and say you're peaceful

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:57pm EDT
i actually thought of this whole setting to incorporate a buncha stuff. but idk if i wanna actually put in the effort lmao

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:57pm EDT
its

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 8:59pm EDT
what i thought up was. okay it's outside. and there's two cherry blossom trees at either end of the page. between these trees, theres a giant scree. the trees are holding it up. the screen is cause i like movies yaknow. and there's a chair, in front of the screen, toward the fron of the paper. okay. annd then on the screen could be something. idk what. but something. like. my living room. there's a bookcase in here cause i do like reading when i actually find a good book. and my computers in here which i'm on way too much, and there could be something on the computer screen and IDK. that just went through my head and like a radio on the ground next to the chair bc i like music. but i don't wanna really draw all that and in my head it actually looks kinda cheesy SOOO

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:00pm EDT
but yk what i mean? it could be this whole big thing if i wanted

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:00pm EDT
that words, maybe it would be better to have like your room and then cherry blossom outside the window? to give better detail the the things you like

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:01pm EDT
or have the contents of your room, but arranged ouutside in a cherry tree grove

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:01pm EDT
idk

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:01pm EDT
i could do that too

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
it sounds like one of the pictures i'd reblog off tumblr lol

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
with a bed hanging in the trees omg

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
that'd be cool though

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
have a drawing pinned to a tree or something. i have a lot of my art stuff and computer graphics stuff hanging

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:02pm EDT
in my room

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:03pm EDT
haha all minbe is in a pile in some drawer somewhere

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:03pm EDT
but yeah, just imagine you room was the cherry tree

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:03pm EDT
rain does not exist in that world

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:04pm EDT
cherry trees

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:04pm EDT
not singular

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:04pm EDT
well that's the thing. it just needs to be representative of me basically. i like nice weather and i hate rain so lol

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:04pm EDT
there ya go

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:05pm EDT
now i just need to apply these ideas o.o

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:05pm EDT
what are you using to draw with?

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:07pm EDT
moar paint?

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:09pm EDT
noooo no moar paint

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:09pm EDT
i think the sword

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:09pm EDT
i'm gonna do in coloured pencils

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:09pm EDT
the self portrait.. maaaybe chalk pastels?

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:09pm EDT
i havent gotten to use them yet

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:09pm EDT
it seems like they'd be better suited the other way around

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:10pm EDT
like pastels don't allow much detail which isn't necessary for fire and leaves and junk

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:10pm EDT
ah but that's the thing

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:10pm EDT
trees are not my specialty

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:10pm EDT
and considering theyre cherry blossom trees

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:10pm EDT
that requires a bunch of shades of pink and stuff

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:10pm EDT
i mean maybe i could do it in coloured pencil

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:11pm EDT
but i definitely can't do the swords in chalk pastels

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:11pm EDT
they wouldn't look as good

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:11pm EDT
yeah i see what ya mean

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:11pm EDT
how big are these supposed to be?

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:12pm EDT
no specific size for these ones

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:13pm EDT
the self potrait might have to big in order to detail it so that like your computer is recognizeable, or maybe you are just way better at pastels than me

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:13pm EDT
cause my stuff is mainly just a blur

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:14pm EDT
i'll work something out with that lol

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:14pm EDT
i mean what do i use it for

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:14pm EDT
fb, wow, tumblr

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:14pm EDT
if anything i could do a tv with like a nintendo 64 and controllers hooked up to it. there's lots of ways i can go with it

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:18pm EDT
yeah that you can just change whenever you feel like

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:18pm EDT
aww you saw the sine tangent bill cosby pun

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:19pm EDT
i was totally gonna use that at some point

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:19pm EDT
hahaha

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:19pm EDT
that was so good

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:30pm EDT
I'm kinda excited to start this stuff! Just gotta write it all down so I dont forget or anything. Hopefully they come out good

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:31pm EDT
I feel like doing either one of these in just pencil would be boring hm

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:33pm EDT
definately not the swords

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:33pm EDT
i can imagine the room thing being in pencil, but it'd be a very different style i suppose

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT
The only thing is that it'd look so pretty in colour

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:35pm EDT
especially since you're doing cherry blossoms

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
which you know are mostly about color

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
I have an 11x14 paper to work with for these.

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
If I can make everything big enough. Chalk pastel would look okay for the room

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
yeah that sound huge, i couldnt imagine making a full scene the size of computer paper let alone that. so youll probly be fine

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:40pm EDT
Eh it's not that big. But big enough I think

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
i really have no clue, but i am sad now that i must switch to ipod

Steph DudakWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:48pm EDT
Oh life. Hate when I have to do that

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:49pm EDT
i am stalling

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:49pm EDT
gotta 'finish' this part of my homework

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:49pm EDT
on tumblr...

Nick DevlinWednesday, August 31, 2011 at 9:49pm EDT
