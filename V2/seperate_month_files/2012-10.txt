I know that you may not be spending all your waking hours in the studio yet, but if you need any input on one of your projects give me a call, text, or email and I'll meet you in the dungeon to talk it over with you. Hope you are enjoying yourself! - Brent YOOOO. funny thing when he talks about studio lololol

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 2, 2012 at 10:22pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, October 2, 2012 at 10:23pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 2, 2012 at 10:25pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
i am crying inside right now

Steph DudakWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:48pm EDT
Mitt Romney is an idiot

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:49pm EDT
he's doing a good job of seeming reasonable right now though

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:51pm EDT
The guy asking questions

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:51pm EDT
needs a button to turn off the guy's mic

Steph DudakWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:51pm EDT
SERIOUSLY

Steph DudakWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:52pm EDT
He needs to be more assertive

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:52pm EDT
They NEVER are

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:52pm EDT
its been years of this shit

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:52pm EDT
hahhaha

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:52pm EDT
'let's not"

Steph DudakWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:52pm EDT
ahahha

Steph DudakWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:52pm EDT
YES

Steph DudakWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:53pm EDT
EXACTLY WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY LOL

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:54pm EDT
I wish it was easier to follow

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:54pm EDT
they need like little graphics in the corner to keep track of the points they make

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:54pm EDT
because they skip around too much

Steph DudakWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:55pm EDT
It'd be cool if they answered questions directly Politics

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:56pm EDT
I sort of understand why they can't

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:56pm EDT
since the topics are so complicated

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:56pm EDT
but still

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:56pm EDT
a one sentence summary

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:56pm EDT
not that hard

Steph DudakWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:56pm EDT
Still they never get a general thing Except Romney did list

Steph DudakWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:56pm EDT
Those five things

Steph DudakWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:56pm EDT
For jobs

Steph DudakWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:57pm EDT
That was the most straightforward thing I've heard him say I think

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:57pm EDT
i like how he lists things

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:57pm EDT
but the lists make no sense

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:58pm EDT
and I hate when polls are used as fact

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 9:58pm EDT
polls are never accurate

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 10:00pm EDT
wow obama

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 10:02pm EDT
"we didn't cut the program we don't have"

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 10:02pm EDT
"democrats aren't dicks and vote for things that republicans propose"

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 10:03pm EDT
a few things I got from romneys last point

Steph DudakWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 10:03pm EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 10:03pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 3, 2012 at 10:05pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, October 11, 2012 at 10:30pm EDT
was abortion

Nick DevlinThursday, October 11, 2012 at 10:30pm EDT
because they answered the question almost

Steph DudakThursday, October 11, 2012 at 10:30pm EDT
debates aren't interesting they suck

Steph DudakThursday, October 11, 2012 at 10:30pm EDT
well

Steph DudakThursday, October 11, 2012 at 10:30pm EDT
these

Steph DudakThursday, October 11, 2012 at 10:31pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:32pm EDT
i'm really boring :(

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:33pm EDT
o

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
i was expecting a story or something

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
im trynna make study models that abstract my painting

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
and my whole concept is structure because of tension and compression

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
but idk how to do that with these study models lololol

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
idk what that means :)

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
what tension and compression and structure is

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:35pm EDT
and making models that abstract your painting

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:35pm EDT
i didnt know that abstract could be a verb

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:36pm EDT
how could you know

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:36pm EDT
not *

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:36pm EDT
know

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:36pm EDT
to make my painting abstract

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:36pm EDT
is that better

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:36pm EDT
idk

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:36pm EDT
ahh

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:36pm EDT
so it was not abstract and now you are making it abstract

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:36pm EDT
duuuh & you know what all those words mean nick devlin! >:P

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:37pm EDT
i know but you used a lot of them at once

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:37pm EDT
and i was watching monty python

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:38pm EDT
i'm guessing the rest of what you said how to do with your idea being something that involves the stretchiness of your model?

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:39pm EDT
http://0.tqn.com/d/arthistory/1/0/e/2/1/Salvador-Dali-Soft-Construction-with-Boiled-Beans-Premonition-of-Civil-War-1936.jpg top left, the hand

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
tension the torso between the two feet on the right compression also

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
the hand on the bottom left

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
and the foot on the bottom right (and also the box)

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
structural

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:41pm EDT
even though theyre dead and decaying and do not show those two things alone like the top half, they serve structural purposes

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:41pm EDT
im taking the head out

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:41pm EDT
the problem is in abstracting this

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:41pm EDT
thats what confused me

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:41pm EDT
its already about as abstract as you get

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:42pm EDT
it's not though think planes and things so for the torso thats between the two feet that goes down to the hand i have four 3X6" rectangles im stacking together

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:42pm EDT
cause it looks thicker and heavier in the painting

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:42pm EDT
oh but the materials only lke

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:42pm EDT
1/16" thick

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:43pm EDT
so for the box im putting two 1x3" ones together, but from the side so it's only about 1/8" when looking from the front

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:43pm EDT
but idk how to translate the whole tension idea into this

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:45pm EDT
by tension, do you mean like... that the hand is clenching?

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:46pm EDT
mhm and stretching the breast from the upper torso of the ~body

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:47pm EDT
so that is a breast

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:47pm EDT
yes

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:47pm EDT
that was gonna be my next question since its hard to tell

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:47pm EDT
gonna do anthing with the beans?

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:48pm EDT
nah

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:48pm EDT
it's got nothing to do with my concept

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:48pm EDT
gotcha

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:48pm EDT
i dont feel theyre important

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:48pm EDT
beans can make things pretty tense though

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:48pm EDT
especially if like your giving a speech and you ate them a couple hours ago

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:48pm EDT
clenching pretty hard

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:48pm EDT
just sayin

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:48pm EDT
-.-

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:49pm EDT
irrelevant!

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:49pm EDT
:D

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:49pm EDT
yeah i know

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:50pm EDT
what materials are you allowed to use?

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:50pm EDT
im using matte board

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:50pm EDT
think of it like

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:50pm EDT
i cant think of anything good to compare it to if you dont know what it is

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:51pm EDT
think of a bunch of posterboard stacked together. it's gota thickness and it's hard its not like cardboard though

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:51pm EDT
well actually

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:51pm EDT
more like what's on the back of notebooks

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:51pm EDT
foamlike

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:51pm EDT
no

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:51pm EDT
ni

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:51pm EDT
i understand

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:51pm EDT
no

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:51pm EDT
yeah

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:51pm EDT
i mean its not that close to that

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:51pm EDT
like what they make boxes out of?

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:51pm EDT
but its hard like that and thicker yk

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:51pm EDT
but easily cut with an xacto knife

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:52pm EDT
fun

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:52pm EDT
that's all you're allowed?'

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:52pm EDT
well it was this or bristol which is essentially really nice, thick paper that is much more expensive than this

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:52pm EDT
or butterboard

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:52pm EDT
but they dont have that in the school store

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:52pm EDT
and i wasnt about to go to blick or utrecht

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:52pm EDT
alright

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:53pm EDT
so I'm really not sur ehow you'd display tension

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:53pm EDT
I would've just been lazy and put some kind of elastic wrapping around the sturcture to make it look strained

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:54pm EDT
cause idgf

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:54pm EDT
but no clue how to convey tense

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:54pm EDT
i wonder if im allowed to use rubber bands rofl

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:55pm EDT
thata what i was thinking

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:55pm EDT
cause if you were allowed other materials

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:55pm EDT
it would be all contrasty and shit

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:55pm EDT
also idgf also stands for International Desktop Grid Federation

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:55pm EDT
im going to email her

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:55pm EDT
thats interesting

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:56pm EDT
aww yeah look at me go

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:56pm EDT
who need sart school

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:56pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:56pm EDT
aint got dat

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:57pm EDT
i has rubber bands do

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:57pm EDT
fun

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:57pm EDT
idk what else to do, like are there certain shapes or anything that are supposed to convey tension?

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:58pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:59pm EDT
-.-

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:59pm EDT
sorry aint nobody got money for that

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:59pm EDT
What do you know about lines? Do you know vertical lines convey boundaries and seem more active? Do you know that a horizontal line conveys restfulness, stability, calm? And, do you know that vertical lines convey action or tension?

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 3:59pm EDT
hmm

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:00pm EDT
i might be able to get it for you for free

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:00pm EDT
OH!

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:00pm EDT
DID YOU KNOW

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:00pm EDT
Occ apparently gives out free everything software to anyone in a computer class?

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:00pm EDT
I have like the past 5 microsoft office packs

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:00pm EDT
along with a million other programs

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:01pm EDT
and some code to get more online

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:02pm EDT
thats pretty great

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:02pm EDT
i thought so

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:02pm EDT
they gave us free antivirus software as well

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:02pm EDT
Do you know that shapes like triangles that have sharp points can convey tension between other shapes? Do you know that rounded shapes convey less tension?

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:02pm EDT
You create greater tension if you place objects near the corners or edges of the format Breaking the format creates more tension in the composition, also.

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:02pm EDT
im gonna try to draw something for you in ps real quick hold on

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:03pm EDT
funfun

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:03pm EDT
holding

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:09pm EDT
ok

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:09pm EDT
Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:09pm EDT
the thickest line is a plane the vertical one it's stiting on is also a plane

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:09pm EDT
kk

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:10pm EDT
the bottom horizontal one might be idk but it's part of the foot on the bottom right so im hesitant

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:10pm EDT
mhmm

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:11pm EDT
I feel like you need prodesktop for this class

Steph DudakSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:11pm EDT
yeah not really im just doing this so you can see one of the ideas and if it conveys anything

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:12pm EDT
yeah, you need prodesktop in order to properly show me

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:12pm EDT
but hmm

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:12pm EDT
i mean it looks sort of unstable

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:12pm EDT
i see a little bit of symmetry

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:12pm EDT
i'm not sure what i'm looking for

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:13pm EDT
i'm positive you will

Nick DevlinSunday, October 14, 2012 at 4:13pm EDT
I'm just slowly falling behind in comprehension of your art

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
because the answer i got

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
confused me i want to see if you get the same

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
did you use product rule and u substitution?

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
do i need to?

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
no

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
i am stupid

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
what im sayin is

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
xlnx

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
derivative of lnx is 1/x

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
yes

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
1/x * x = x/x = 1

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
derivative of x=1

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
1-1=0

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
you need product rule

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
for xlnx

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
?

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
x and ln(x) are being multiplied yeah

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
hmph

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
okie

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
so x * 1/x * ln(x) *1

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
that middle * is a +

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT
i know how to do it and everything

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT
i just i dont even know lol

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT
cause i treated it like

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT
if it said 2x^2 yk

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT
x as coefificient

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT
i gotchu

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT
i think...

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT
this shit is just confusing because the notation is stupid

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:31pm EDT
the constantly make us write everything out, but they can't be bothered to include a few parenthesis

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:31pm EDT
so 1+lnx = f'(x)?

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:31pm EDT
thats what i got

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
x/x=1 and ln(x)*1=ln(x)

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
and the -1 gets thrown out

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
well then how the hell do i do this problem

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
cause

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
i need to find

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
the intervals on which f(x) is increasing and decreasing

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
and local extrema

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
idk if youve done that yet?

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:32pm EDT
owait there is a -x at the end, sis you turn that to 1?

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:33pm EDT
because then it just turns to ln9x)

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:33pm EDT
ln(x)

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:33pm EDT
the ones cancel out

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:33pm EDT
question still stands

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:34pm EDT
cause now im just left with lnx

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:34pm EDT
I've done things where we find out if the function is increasing or decreasing at a given point

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:34pm EDT
all real numbers as my answer??? idk!!

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:34pm EDT
exactly and theres nothing to do here and no regiions to test

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:34pm EDT
regions (

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:34pm EDT
***

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:37pm EDT
if they dont give a region...

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:37pm EDT
no its like

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:37pm EDT
oh wait

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:37pm EDT
can i set lnx equal to 0?

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:38pm EDT
yes

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:38pm EDT
but

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:38pm EDT
i mean

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:38pm EDT
that gives you where it is horizontal

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:38pm EDT
what makes that equal 0

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:38pm EDT
omg wait

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:38pm EDT
nvm hold on

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:38pm EDT
ln(1)=0?

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
derp yes

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
i forgot i had to set this equal to zero

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
then i forgot

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
lnx=y e^y=x

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
silly steph

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
thanks for your help nicholas

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
very

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
of course

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
you have no idea

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:39pm EDT
how happy i am that I could help

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:40pm EDT
I finally am back up to par in math

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:40pm EDT
:D

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:41pm EDT
should i say that it does not decrease? or like

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:41pm EDT
cause

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:41pm EDT
it cant you cant take the natural log of 0 or a negative number

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:41pm EDT
so it increases (1, infinity)

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:41pm EDT
but doesnt decrease (-infinity, 1)

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:41pm EDT
ill say it dne

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:42pm EDT
good plan

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:42pm EDT
would x=1 be a local max or min or neither? still dont really know how that works honestly

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:43pm EDT
never evven heard of it :(

Steph DudakWednesday, October 24, 2012 at 9:43pm EDT
oooo okie

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:03pm EDT
i'm not hoping for that

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:03pm EDT
I know you aren't

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:03pm EDT
i'm just hoping for rain that will get me out of class and minimal to more hopefully no damage

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:03pm EDT
But no one adds that second part because they all forget

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:04pm EDT
that some people dont have homes that could withstand a storm that bad

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:04pm EDT
let me know how everything goes down by you the first thing my environmental science teacher said yesterday was like yeah y'all hear about the hurricane that's gonna hit? yeah it's definitely gonna hit nj

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:04pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:04pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:14pm EDT
THE END OF THE GIRLS HALLWAY ALL THAT'S THERE IS A WINDOW AND ONE OTHER ROOM

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:14pm EDT
i was thinking about how you said that

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:15pm EDT
creep status

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:15pm EDT
you got a not so secret admirer~

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:15pm EDT
i told rich and he was like NAH i knew he was a weirdo when we came back from dinner

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:15pm EDT
after we went out, we came back to my room and abbie decided

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:15pm EDT
SHE WAS GOING TO BED AT 8PM

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:16pm EDT
so i was like wow great um okay. so got changed and we hung out in the lounge for a little bit so she could get her ass to sleep and stuff

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:16pm EDT
and sure enough brendan was in there cause he like lives there on the other couch and we were there on my laptop just looking at dumb comics and videos and things

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:16pm EDT
and yeah that was awkward we ran into him when i opened the door to the hall when we came back too

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:17pm EDT
he's normal sometimes but most of the time

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:17pm EDT
he's creepy and pisses me off a lot

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:17pm EDT
like he thinks he's funny but when i'm literally telling him, shut the fuck up, you're being an asshole, i know i have to do this, then listen to me

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:17pm EDT
and don't be surprised that i'm getting pissed off

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:17pm EDT
i have a low tolerance for annoying people and it's not hard to make me mad LEAVE ME ALONE

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:18pm EDT
thats irritating

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:18pm EDT
extremely irritating

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:18pm EDT
when people are bothersome enough to annoy you and make you want to never talk to them again

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:19pm EDT
but dont do anything bad enough to warrant it

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:19pm EDT
just minimal creepiness/ annoyingness

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:19pm EDT
exactly

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:19pm EDT
hes annoying and he's distracting

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:19pm EDT
and especially needs to GO AWAY WHEN IM IN STUDIO

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:20pm EDT
because hes always like watch this look at this omg this is funny

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:20pm EDT
and like yeah

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:20pm EDT
sometimes it is

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:20pm EDT
BUT IM HERE BECAUSE I HAVE WORK TO GET DONE

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:20pm EDT
NOT TO DO NOTHING LIKE YOU LEAVE ME ALONE AND STOP TOUCHING EVERYTHING AROUND ME

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:26pm EDT
yeahhh

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:26pm EDT
I try to make people like that hate me

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:26pm EDT
but since I'm so awesome it never works

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:26pm EDT
ah well

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:26pm EDT
youd think he would amy and I only call him mommy pants/mommy

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:26pm EDT
but more ghetto like. it's more exaggerated like mami

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:26pm EDT
because one day

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:27pm EDT
amy, brandon, brendan, grace, and i were walking to the school store during design to get matte board and brendan like sprinted across the street at the 7 seconds left to cross so we all stood there

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:27pm EDT
and amy goes

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:27pm EDT
can we just talk about brendans mom pants he was wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt and may or may not have looked a little like a pregnant mother

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:28pm EDT
so while we were waiting for the ramvan brandon told brendan about the mom pants thing so that's what we call him now bc we don't like him

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:28pm EDT
and hes just like lolol yyyy faklgjfkhjdfkhljdahj

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:29pm EDT
youd think he would hate me right cause i'm easily irritated and dont ever address him by his real name

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:29pm EDT
but i guess not

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:29pm EDT
it shows an affectionate nick name

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:30pm EDT
meh

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:30pm EDT
he knows why we're calling him it though and he doesnt like it

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:30pm EDT
maybe he thinks it is 4th grade

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:30pm EDT
i think the problem

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:30pm EDT
is he doesnt have a lady friend And realy wants to get laid by SOMEONE SOMEWHERE so he just annoys everyone

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:31pm EDT
hahaha

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:32pm EDT
that seems to be a common problem

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:32pm EDT
and he isnt going about handling it very well

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:32pm EDT
not at all

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:32pm EDT
first of all ya know your kinda taken

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:32pm EDT
theres other girls that are single that he can bother ??? so

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:32pm EDT
he met rich.

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:32pm EDT
he MET him

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:33pm EDT
thats why i am bemused

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:33pm EDT
hes annoying to amy too, but not as much as he is to me. she's got a man too

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:33pm EDT
niggas gotta step off

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:33pm EDT
i've seen

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:33pm EDT
it was weird too one day

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:33pm EDT
i was in writing

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:33pm EDT
and it was the monday after rich was here i think

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
and brendan was like your boyfriend drives ALL the way down here to see you?

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
im like

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
uh

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
yeah

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
every other weekend we only live 1.5 hrs away

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
sometimes 2 sometimes 1

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
if he drives 500mph

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
like LEAVE

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:35pm EDT
thats unfortunate

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:35pm EDT
i'm really glad i'm not a girl

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:37pm EDT
its so stupid

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:37pm EDT
like i've heard every girl complain about this kind of crap

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:38pm EDT
cause boys are creepy more often than girls are i feel

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:38pm EDT
know what i mean

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:38pm EDT
i do

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:39pm EDT
especially since like every once in a while I think, oh god i was just super creepy fuck

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:39pm EDT
then never talk to that person again

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:39pm EDT
see but if youre creepy once and youre like shit and youre normal for the most part for the rest of forever then its fine

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:39pm EDT
but then you have people like brendan people like mark

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
I can understand that too

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
they think

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
fuck i was creepy

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
i have to keep talking to her

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
show her that i am not a creep

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
which obviously is not how you should go about talking to someone

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
orrrr

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
never realize it and you just are that way

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:41pm EDT
abbie told me she thought brendan was interested i said i just think hes lonely, not necessarily interested esp bc he knows rich exists but if he were, then i can say i only attract creepy people except for rich

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:41pm EDT
that was my other thought, every girl i know just attracts creepy people

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:41pm EDT
i suppose there's one normal one in all the mess

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:42pm EDT
that being

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:43pm EDT
is that a question

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:43pm EDT
:P

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:43pm EDT
jerk hahaha

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:43pm EDT
rich isn't creepy he's weird but it's an acceptable weird

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:44pm EDT
Maybe it's cause you are all rational human beings who don't judge much based on interests. So the weird people just think they have a chance and go for it incessantly

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:44pm EDT
not a "you need to leave right now" weird

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:44pm EDT
there are many variations

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:44pm EDT
like the cute weird and the awe inspiring weird

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:44pm EDT
gross weird

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:45pm EDT
uncomfortable weird

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:45pm EDT
funny weird

Steph DudakSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:45pm EDT
there is tons

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 3:45pm EDT
basically anything that someone has as a characteristic can be made weird

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 4:48pm EDT
III***

Nick DevlinSaturday, October 27, 2012 at 4:48pm EDT
