Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 7:55pm EDT
Do you have a picture you are basing the swords off of

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 7:55pm EDT
?

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 7:56pm EDT
Im trying not to do that

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 7:56pm EDT
But I might have to

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 7:57pm EDT
Because my creativity level for something like this seems to be dangerously low lol

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 7:57pm EDT
well then no duh the swrod won't look awesome because you haven't really been practicing drawing awesome swords!

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 7:57pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 7:58pm EDT
No ._.

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 7:58pm EDT
Well let's see. I have five days left. Well four...

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 7:58pm EDT
then just copy off a couple cool dword with the design you need until you know how to make them

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 7:58pm EDT
If I spend the rest of the night practicing, I have to come up with something awesome right?

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 7:59pm EDT
yeah

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 7:59pm EDT
Meh

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:01pm EDT
what kind of design are you trying for? scimtar saber katakana broadsword?

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:01pm EDT
Do you wanna see the silly thing I drew up? This one was quick and it's mainly the hilt lol. Trynna focus on that a little for nao.

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:01pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:01pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:20pm EDT
Yes*

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:25pm EDT
Anything?!

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:41pm EDT
SO

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:44pm EDT
if you didn't reference anything, then it is awesome comparatively

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:44pm EDT
its just minor dtuff

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:44pm EDT
but the basic design is cool

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:44pm EDT
hard to tell without the blade though

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:44pm EDT
Wonderful

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:44pm EDT
Oh it's going to be fixed. Big time

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:45pm EDT
i'd really recomed getting some to at least basse the proportions off of

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:48pm EDT
Oh well yeah

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:48pm EDT
And like I said that was quick

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:50pm EDT
I told you a lot of things were off lol. I'm aware of the lack of proportion, etc

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
will the two swords have different designs like the hilt and everything or will just the fire and leaves on the blade be the only difference?

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
Good question

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
I wad thinking about them being two completely different swords

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
Maybe the one with leaves being a thinner, smaller one

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
To emphasize it's uselessness.

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:54pm EDT
Something you can wield with one hand

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:54pm EDT
Meanwhile having the other more of a two handed sword. It'd obviously be bigger. And on fire

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:54pm EDT
gotcha, more elegant design for the fire and clunky for the plants

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:55pm EDT
opposite of what i said*

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
Yes

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 8:59pm EDT
Exactly

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:00pm EDT
awesome

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:00pm EDT
i am sweating

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:00pm EDT
dont eat 4 bowls of hot chicken soup

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:00pm EDT
when its like 90 degrees in your house

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:00pm EDT
just some advice

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:04pm EDT
Four bowls

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:04pm EDT
Do you have your windows open?

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:04pm EDT
It's awfully nice outside

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:05pm EDT
No my wiondows is closed, and I'm too lazy to go and open one

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:05pm EDT
but not too lazy to get a 5th bowl

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:06pm EDT
i'm so fat

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:11pm EDT
Lmfao

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:11pm EDT
You're not fat tho.

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:11pm EDT
Go open a window while you're up

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:11pm EDT
Kill two birds with one stone

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:13pm EDT
of course i'm fat i must weigh at least like 120, you know in europe being like 20 stone is morbidly obese?

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:13pm EDT
what does that make me?!

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:14pm EDT
120 is not that much lol

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:15pm EDT
hm i think i'd actually weigh clser to 10 stone

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:15pm EDT
maybe less

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:16pm EDT
i don't actually know how much I weigh...

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:16pm EDT
if i did though

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:16pm EDT
i could calculate more accurately

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:16pm EDT
anyway

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:16pm EDT
enough of my struggles with obesity

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:16pm EDT
the window problema is fixed

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:17pm EDT
Or lack thereof

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:17pm EDT
That's good!

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:21pm EDT
I KNOW!

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:21pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
That's awesome

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
And hilarious

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:40pm EDT
i thought so, but I can't get the image to get onto tumblr and still be legible

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:45pm EDT
thaaat's lame .-.

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:45pm EDT
i still am completely unable to post pictures on tumblr that have nice quality, even I have them downloaded

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:46pm EDT
I will look through options tomorrow and see if I can fix

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:46pm EDT
This NEEDS to be on tumblr and I can't find it on there already

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:50pm EDT
hm

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT
are you using the post photo option?

Steph DudakThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT
i mean if it comes out tiny usually it can just be clicked to make it bigger..

Nick DevlinThursday, September 1, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
yeah i pick the photo option, I think i messed with stuff in my preferences

Nick DevlinFriday, September 2, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
How are the swords coming al

Nick DevlinFriday, September 2, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
ong?

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
or 5

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
i realize this is an hour late response. idk if you're even on right now but no matter

Nick DevlinFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
Awake I am

Nick DevlinFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
Not to worry

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
http://i53.tinypic.com/vsdxj5.png

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
click click click. i need to find out how to like

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
uh, make the blade outta leaves and stuff and make it look good. but i might make the hilt like that

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
OH AND

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
i need to draw this on an 18x24 piece of paper

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
bc the minimum size is 16x20 i think it is

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
but i dont have that size

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
womp

Nick DevlinFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:26pm EDT
That sucks

Nick DevlinFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:26pm EDT
How complete is that sketch? Like want criticism or praise at this stage?

Nick DevlinFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:30pm EDT
At a certain point saying little things that need to adjusted isn't much help if you like colouring it tomorrow morning

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
It's not on the final page yet

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
Criticism is welcome

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
That's just me practicing

Nick DevlinFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:34pm EDT
Do you want the swords symmetrical? I know this is just a sketch but I was just wondering

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:34pm EDT
I'm only doing one

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:35pm EDT
But that's kinda the plan

Nick DevlinFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:37pm EDT
No like the sword itself is symmetrical like left and right side

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:39pm EDT
Yeah

Nick DevlinFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
Alright I just wanted to know. Not sure why. But any way it's just minor things that are because of sketching reasons like lines touching and blablabla. But I do think some of the little designs on the hilt could be improved to flow better

Nick DevlinFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:48pm EDT
I really wish I could just copy onto paint and show line changes

Nick DevlinFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:48pm EDT
Damn ipod

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:48pm EDT
Asdjlmfsvj

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:49pm EDT
It's also not detailed or anything as I'd like it to be. But like I said. I didn't even expect to like this one the slightest bit lol. I feel the detail on the hilt should kinda go with the whole nature theme tho

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:50pm EDT
The little diamond shapes might be green

Nick DevlinFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:50pm EDT
I will see how ling until I can kick my sister off the computer, she's stopped listening to my threats lately

Nick DevlinFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:50pm EDT
Its annoying

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:51pm EDT
Things I hate about having to use a shared computer

Nick DevlinFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:51pm EDT
But yeah I think giving the sword a nature theme is good

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:51pm EDT
My siblings are douchebags and I'm only allowed on for an hour at a time unless they're not around or it's late

Nick DevlinFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:52pm EDT
Hehe, I'm the douchebag sibling at my house.

Nick DevlinFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:53pm EDT
But sadly those fun times are changing one sister has grown a backbone and the other has moved

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:57pm EDT
I can't be the douchebag bc they annoy me til I get off

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:59pm EDT
Hardcore annoy me lol

Nick DevlinFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:59pm EDT
Yep that's pretty much what I do

Nick DevlinFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:59pm EDT
I read fox in socks to her this afternoon until she got angry and went away

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:59pm EDT
See but if I did that I'd be a hypocrite and then when I'm on they'd be like BUT YOU DO THIS TO ME SK

Steph DudakFriday, September 2, 2011 at 11:59pm EDT
SO*

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 12:00am EDT
It's basically a lose lose situation

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 12:00am EDT
Sounds awful.

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 12:00am EDT
Lmao oh gosh

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 12:00am EDT
IT IS AWFUL

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
Is there only one computer?

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
Like no laptop or anything?

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
Correct

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 12:06am EDT
Oh my god how do you survive?

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 12:07am EDT
I at least have either a laptop or a notebook or a shitty computer from 10 years ago that still works for some reason

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 12:07am EDT
Idk how

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 12:07am EDT
It's especially frustrating when I'm doing something that takes time

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 12:20am EDT
I can imagine. Things like tumblr

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 12:21am EDT
And facebook status with 100s of comments

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 12:21am EDT
And WoW junk

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 12:26am EDT
Exactly

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 12:26am EDT
Especially wow junk oh man. But that'll change once school starts

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 12:27am EDT
Play time will go down a lot

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 12:29am EDT
I bet the minecraft 1.8 update will come out the day I have a ton of school junk and colorguard stuff to do.

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 12:30am EDT
And my poor tumblr will not have nearly as many awesome pics

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 12:33am EDT
Always happens!

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 12:34am EDT
I still manage to be on tumblr a lot anyhow. No going back now

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 12:35am EDT
Has Kerry posted anything yet?

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 12:40am EDT
5 posts

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 12:40am EDT
All reblogs

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 12:43am EDT
I don't think she's fully accepting tumblr yet

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 12:47am EDT
nope

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 12:47am EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 1:00am EDT
Well then

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 1:00am EDT
I guess he doesn't choose to show his bday on his fb

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 1:01am EDT
i guess

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 1:01am EDT
and the riddle is very vague

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 1:01am EDT
along with making little sense

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 1:01am EDT
So far I've discovered he was born on 2010

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 1:02am EDT
Yeah I have a sliiiiight feeling that's incorrect

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 1:03am EDT
He graduated when we were freshman

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 1:03am EDT
she said its his birthday from that year

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 1:03am EDT
He's three years older than us

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 1:03am EDT
i love the update delay of ipods :D

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 1:03am EDT
So you figure 91

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 1:04am EDT
thats probly correct

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 1:05am EDT
Yeah lol you need to find the day of the anniversary

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 1:06am EDT
Year means nothing basically

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 1:06am EDT
yep

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:26pm EDT
How far are you on the sword? Have you started the final copy yet?

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:26pm EDT
YES

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:26pm EDT
:D

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
Awesome!

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
And I figured out how to use the java API!!

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
So much progress today

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
I'll send you a pick. I'm drawing the twigs and stufff

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
Dumdum

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
Funfun

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
XML

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
Fml

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
-.-

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
Okay so the white in these isn't gonna stay white

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
That'll be detailed later. Here we go.

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
ILL JUST POST THEM ON YOUR WALL THEY WON'T SEND >:|

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
Close up

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
Mkay

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
This one sent

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:34pm EDT
Yep I see that

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:34pm EDT
Is there another on my wall?

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:35pm EDT
I'm on message app and am too lazy to check

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:36pm EDT
Ok let's try the other then.

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:36pm EDT
I checked my wall

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:36pm EDT
That thing is awesome

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:38pm EDT
Fb really fucks up the quality

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:38pm EDT
Meh I can see the plant details in the close up

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:39pm EDT
I like the red tint on the hilt.

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:39pm EDT
But the white isn't staying white and there's still half a blade to go. I tried to send this like 10 tines so idk If you already got that.

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:40pm EDT
I got a pick showing the hilt and beginning of blade and a close up showing where you started the plants on the blade

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT
:D

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT
Excellent

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
The plants look cool but I think the shading on that gem could be fixed.

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:43pm EDT
It's not done lol I'm doing that later too

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:43pm EDT
I'm kind of a mess when I draw.

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:43pm EDT
I don't really know how far into that you are though, since gems/ glass have ridiculous shading

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:43pm EDT
Oh not very far it seems by my lag

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:44pm EDT
Just wanted to make sure

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:47pm EDT
Yes yes. I've never been so excited to like draw and stuff

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:49pm EDT
How are you gonna make plants? Like wrapped around strangling the blade? or draping it with vines or branches or whatever hanging off?

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:50pm EDT
You should be excited this thing will be awesome!

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:53pm EDT
Well everything's sorta intertwined. I think I'm gonna draw this and see how it comes out. Cause I was thinking of having leaves hanging off

Steph DudakSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:53pm EDT
Or at least falling off

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:54pm EDT
If you want it to look useless I think that would be good, if it was just wrapped in vines I think it would actually look stronger

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 3, 2011 at 11:54pm EDT
So stuff hanging off is good

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
Please continue updating! I am probably gonna fall asleep soon, so sorry for when I stop replying.

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 12:05am EDT
I'm almost done drawing the main part of this. Then I gotta colour it

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 12:05am EDT
If you fall asleep I'm just gonna keep posting pics on your wall. I'll probably do that anyway cause it's easier lol

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 12:07am EDT
Hope you don't mind

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 12:08am EDT
Funfun, so when I wake up randomly at like 3 am I get something to do

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 12:08am EDT
Yes!

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 2:47am EDT
i'm still working on this thing

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 3:11am EDT
I think I'm done for tonight

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:54am EDT
looks pretty awesome so far

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:54am EDT
why am i up at 7 am? I DONT KNOW

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:54am EDT
I couldn't fall back asleep

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 5:50pm EDT
This looks so much better in person but anyway. Im almost finished!

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:05pm EDT
awesome

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:05pm EDT
is that all of the blade?

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:05pm EDT
looks short

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:06pm EDT
the details look awesome though

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:06pm EDT
What are you gonna do for a background?

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:07pm EDT
I only have so much space. If I made the blade longer, the handle would be too short.

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:07pm EDT
I don't think I'm gonna bother with a background

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:07pm EDT
That's a lot of space to fill and that'll take even more time

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:08pm EDT
By time I'm done with this I'll have invested at least 10 hours in this project lol it's ridiculous.

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:08pm EDT
A little less if you take out some time to take and send pictures and junk

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:11pm EDT
oh right, its real paper, I guess you can't just extend the border -.-

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:11pm EDT
so used to drawing programs, I still use cntrl z even when writing/ sketching junk

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:11pm EDT
anyway

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:12pm EDT
thats quite a bit of time

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:12pm EDT
you started the last one yet?

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:13pm EDT
Exactly. Paper limits. Anyway, nope lol. And I gotta finish my lit assignment too

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:13pm EDT
Kill me.

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:15pm EDT
you probably should have started this sooner -_-

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:15pm EDT
i mean at least I only have one assignment

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:15pm EDT
and i can just google fill in answers

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:16pm EDT
I should've. Mrs Calicchio should've given this to us at the beginning of summer. But I still had enough time

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:16pm EDT
I'm researching two artists for the third assignment

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:16pm EDT
So that'll take an hour maybe. Two at most. Same with lit

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:16pm EDT
I gotta do the catcher in the rye book review

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:17pm EDT
But I don't remember anything about that book.

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:17pm EDT
oh you're still doing ap lit?

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:18pm EDT
Well

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:18pm EDT
I'll show you the email I got back

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:18pm EDT
Hello Stephanie, There are no more schedules changes until Tuesday 9/6. At that point the only changes will be students who have hard conflicts (errors). Any other changes will not happen until 9/12. Sincerely, Mrs. Monica Santamaria-Vasslides

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:19pm EDT
So I figured I might as well finish it so I don't look like a douchebag on the first day.

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:19pm EDT
did you show the email?

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:20pm EDT
Yes I just sent it to you

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:27pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:27pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:27pm EDT
It said

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 6:28pm EDT
There are no more schedule changes until Tuesday. At that point the only changes will be students who have hard conflicts (errors). Any other changes won't happen until 9/12.

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 7:46pm EDT
I have an answer lol I just need to resend it to my email bc it's sideways and I can't rotate it on here and I'm not entirely happy with how this came out lol fuck me

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 7:47pm EDT
Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 7:50pm EDT
that guard is awesome

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 7:50pm EDT
you should probably call it a dagger now

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 7:51pm EDT
Its blade is really tiny

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 7:51pm EDT
:D

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 7:56pm EDT
-_-

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 7:57pm EDT
It's not small enough to be called a dagger though

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 8:02pm EDT
hmm... time to google!

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 8:05pm EDT
it appears blades aren't defined by length by by how they are used, the style they cut in and the arts in which they are used

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 8:05pm EDT
in which case

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 8:05pm EDT
what you made has no name!

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 8:06pm EDT
So I can still call it a sword

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 8:07pm EDT
if you choose to

Nick DevlinSunday, September 4, 2011 at 8:07pm EDT
there are examples of swords that small

Steph DudakSunday, September 4, 2011 at 8:23pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:10pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:10pm EDT
i better get fluent before i'm outta college

Steph DudakTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:10pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:11pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:11pm EDT
yes that one

Steph DudakTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:11pm EDT
otherwise i take that back

Steph DudakTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:11pm EDT
HOW

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:12pm EDT
He's already fluent in Spanish

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:13pm EDT
so he for some reason was advised not to take spanish culture or whatever they use for people who speak spanish

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:13pm EDT
because he was too fluent

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:13pm EDT
so somehow he just got in spanish 4

Steph DudakTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:13pm EDT
so they put him in spanish 4 lol

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:13pm EDT
I mean there is spanish 5, idk why he's not in that

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:14pm EDT
So, during class today, he spoke entirely in Spanish slang/ colloquially

Steph DudakTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:14pm EDT
omg

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:14pm EDT
just to mess with the teacher, Mika, who even I can tell has never learned it that well

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:14pm EDT
Like she has the same accent as students do

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:15pm EDT
which is very bad

Steph DudakTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:15pm EDT
haaaaa hahaha

Steph DudakTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:15pm EDT
that's funny

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:16pm EDT
but the class should be fun I suppose, it feels like I've gone back a year actually

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:16pm EDT
because the teacher is using cute spanish names for everyone and we're playing all those kids games

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:17pm EDT
but whatever

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:17pm EDT
is fun

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:18pm EDT
onto period 7!!

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:19pm EDT
which will be a complete joke if I actually take the class

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:19pm EDT
Web Page design

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:19pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:20pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:20pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:21pm EDT
and i really need an intro to that program

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:21pm EDT
maybe i will even be able to steal a copy of the program

Steph DudakTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:25pm EDT
oh nice

Steph DudakTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:26pm EDT
you should just drop it and take lunch lol

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:27pm EDT
i'm considering rearranging schedule to have that class instead of study hall

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:27pm EDT
it will be difficult

Steph DudakTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:31pm EDT
scheduling is difficult

Steph DudakTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:36pm EDT
this year will be either really awesome or not awesome at all

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:36pm EDT
probly

Steph DudakTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:36pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:42pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:44pm EDT
/:

Steph DudakTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:45pm EDT
would art history count as a history class? lol

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:45pm EDT
i almost considered switching to that class

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 6, 2011 at 3:45pm EDT
but then i was like nah

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 2:47pm EDT
Sounds fun. Are you still considering changing? Or have you resigned yourself to a year of 'fun'

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 2:48pm EDT
idk what i'm going to do yet

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 2:48pm EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 2:50pm EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 2:50pm EDT
x.x

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 2:50pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 2:51pm EDT
If you had santamaria I think she switched to different stuff

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 2:52pm EDT
when i went to see her at the end of the year, there was some other lady in for her

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 2:52pm EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 2:52pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 2:53pm EDT
Yep, I think she's in that other position now

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 2:54pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 2:57pm EDT
I deserve a medal for going this long without making a duck joke of some kind

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 2:58pm EDT
Must've been like a minute and a half

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
I

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
Am so

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
Annoyed

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
because?

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 9:40pm EDT
Could you possibly answer this question for me: Q is a point on the y axis 2radical10 units from the point (6,1). Find out all the possible coordinates of Q. So there'll be two yeah? Cause it's 2radical10 apart from (6,1) on the y axis. So usually I'd think okay. Ill just add the 2radical10 to 1 and then do it negatively as well but you can't add radicals and whole numbers together.

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 9:40pm EDT
Idk what I'm doing. And I cant use a decimal or anything

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 9:41pm EDT
you have to convert your numbers

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 9:41pm EDT
and you're correct about there being 2 seperate points

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
oooh you also have to use the hypotenuse of a right trinagle for this problem

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT
what on earth are you doing? this is 2nd day?!

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT
So what exactly do I need to do then? ^ that was supposed to be sent like five mins ago

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT
Whaaaaat!

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 9:45pm EDT
Yes it is. This is one of 5 problems.

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 9:45pm EDT
I finished three. The last one is to find the slope of (a, a/b) (b, b/a)

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 9:48pm EDT
-.-that sounds annoying

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 9:48pm EDT
I am making diagram on paint to show you this problem

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 9:48pm EDT
That is very much appreciated lol thanks

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
all right so imagine that 2(radical)10 is the radius of a circle

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
the two points you need are the ones that intersect the y axis

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 9:53pm EDT
http://i551.photobucket.com/albums/ii472/dravarian26/MATH.png

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 9:53pm EDT
ignore the numbers i put

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT
so you just need to find the exact points, probably using the pytagorean theorum because you know the length of horizontal leg (6) and the hypotenuse (2radical10)

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT
to find where on the y axis you intersect with the circle

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:03pm EDT
Okay so when squaring that 2radical10 thing. Won't the radical10 become radical 100 and then I end up taking that out as a 10 and multiplying? Byyy four? Bc you square the 2 also don't you? Idk. Is that how Im supposed to Be doing this? If I do that then I get xsquared equals 4 and the other side is then 2.

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:03pm EDT
Idk if thats where I was even supposed to go with that.

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT
Alright do you even care how it happened or do you just want the problem that you need to solve?

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT
Cause I can give you that much easier

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:05pm EDT
I guess so. I need to show some form of work though

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:06pm EDT
yeah i will give you the math, just not explain how it correlated to the actual question

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:09pm EDT
this is the problem you need to solve

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:09pm EDT
http://i551.photobucket.com/albums/ii472/dravarian26/MATH-1.png

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:10pm EDT
you understand that part right?

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:11pm EDT
I basically just did that. You said use the Pythagorean theorem and by doing that I get 2 for x. That's the whole thing I just explained and asked if I was doing it right

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:11pm EDT
then you are doing it right

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:11pm EDT
so your coordinates would end up being 0,3 and 0, -1

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:12pm EDT
problem solved

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:12pm EDT
Now to finish my homework

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:12pm EDT
You're a genius thank you

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:13pm EDT
I'm shocked you're doing hw lol what for?

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:14pm EDT
I have to make 3 sketch title blocks (finishing 2nd now), do 12 problems in comp. science after reading the chapter she didn't go over, right 10 senteces about first day of school in spanish, and try to figure out my schedule

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:14pm EDT
not including the band scheduling

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:15pm EDT
and finding a type font to study for art

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:15pm EDT
and making a poster for juggling club

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:15pm EDT
but thats it

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:16pm EDT
Helvetica is a lovely font.

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:16pm EDT
Goodness that's quite a bit o.o

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:17pm EDT
Title block sketches is easy though

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:17pm EDT
I am starting 3rd now

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:17pm EDT
and i kind of want serifs on my font

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:17pm EDT
You can make em as complex or simple as you want.

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:18pm EDT
Ah I see

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:18pm EDT
Well picking a font isn't too difficult

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
I have a couple, but one I really want I am unable to find

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
Do you need to be able to actually use it for something?

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:20pm EDT
i just want something to base off for making letters

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:20pm EDT
I'm not actually copying just getting ideas

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:20pm EDT
about line thickness and serif placement

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
so that I don't waste hours making each line exactly right, I'll just have references to use

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:22pm EDT
Yeah. I was gonna say just google the font I'm sure there's some examples of it somewhere but yeah

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:25pm EDT
any ideas on what i would do for last title block?

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
i have no brain right now

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
Whatcha got for your first two?

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
i made a honeycomb pattern with hexagons

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
and just filled in that with the text

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
and i got another with no vertical lines and each intersection has a little dot, it looks kind of circuit-y

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
but not really

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
Well you could make some sort of image in the corner/bottom to put the info in. Like a sword o.o I should've thought of that last yr omg. This kid Joe did a train

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
He talked about it

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
I think I've told you that before

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
and the sword idea is cool

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
yes you have talked about

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
I made mine really simple

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
i laughed when he mentioned it

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
Just cause sometimes you can't go wrong with simplicity. And haha that's awesome

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
I made sure not to have a bajillion lines in any, otherwise it would distract from my name!

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
Hahah of course

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
I will just use the sword idea i think

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
Yessss

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
and i will make a little gemstone on the hilt

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
Show me it when you make it or whatever I wanna see!

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:38pm EDT
which of these should i use?

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:38pm EDT
http://www.wjxr.com/images/gemstone_shapes.jpg

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:38pm EDT
and i will take pics or scan them all eventually

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:38pm EDT
when they are done

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:39pm EDT
Marquis or trillion

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:39pm EDT
I actually like trillion most

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:39pm EDT
i was thinking trillion or round

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:39pm EDT
so trillion it is

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:40pm EDT
I vote trillion. It's more interesting

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:44pm EDT
alright sword done

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:44pm EDT
just need to place boxes which i will do in study hall

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
Wooo!

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:50pm EDT
Fantastique .-. L'espagnol est tres interessant.

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT
you just spoke like archaic spanish

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT
or some romantic language

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
its not french or spanish

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
or portuguese

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
>:|

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
is it french?

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
You know what language that is wacko

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
it doesn't look french

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
Duh

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
It is

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
i guess it is then

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
well, si! es muy muy interesante

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
yo no se como popular sarcasmo es en espanol

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
That's basically the extent of my lingual Abilites. English, some French, and of course "hola" "adios" "bienvenidos" which I don't think I spelled right and "puedo ir el bao" if that's how you spell that.. Probably not.

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
Sarcasm isn't popular in Spanish? You're what?

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
looks right to me, you actually used the little tilde thing

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
i don't know how popular sarcasm is in spanish

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
Ahhhh

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
Gotcha

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:58pm EDT
i am so bad at these

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:58pm EDT
i've done like 2

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
What do you have so far

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
my first class was english

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
I have friends in my English class. I'm taking blah blah and o think it's gonna be super awesome

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:02pm EDT
I shoved seven freshmen into lockers.

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:02pm EDT
i am translating how to say i saw all my friends now

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:02pm EDT
This was my last first day of high school

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:04pm EDT
alright i did that one

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:05pm EDT
What else did you do the first day

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
Are you there for all 8 periods?

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:07pm EDT
i just wrote i don't have lunch

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:08pm EDT
and I take lots of computer classes

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:09pm EDT
Excellent

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:10pm EDT
alright done

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:10pm EDT
i'm never doing homework again

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
this was awful

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:12pm EDT
It's just new to you. You'll get used to if

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:12pm EDT
It*

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:13pm EDT
i highly doubt that, it's only the first week this won't last past september if even that

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
Yeah probably not since you're a slacker

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
I on the other hand am going to be working like crazy and cannot procrastinate so much

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
or more hopefully i mght just be ahead and ab;e to do stuff in class

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
Btw I got a backpack lol

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
And I haven't been to my locker once yet

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
Hopefully, I wish you good luck with that though lol

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
yay!!

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
how many books you have so far?

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT
Well as far as text books I have my two lit books and pre calc one. I don't need to carry them to school though. But I might my pre calc one just in case. Then I have two binders even though I prefer notebooks but yk. Gotta have the dumb things

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
No physics textbook yet. Luckily no book for world affairs

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
yeah i'm not using binders at all I think, I am terrible with them. I think that trapper keeper thing for loose leaf and a composition notebook for notes works pretty weel

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
well*

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
seriously? a history class without a notebook?

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
weird

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
Textbook

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
same thing

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
It's world affairs.

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
you know what i meant

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
which is a social studies

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
which is history

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
It's all news and stuff going on in the world

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
Lots of today stuff

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
Not like oh back in 1925...

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
a relevant history class? weirder and weirder

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
The only thing is that 40% of my grade will be class participation

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
Meaning talking. I have 30 something kids in my class as well

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
and you have the class of... "enthusiastic" people

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
oh god I don't even want to imagine listening to debates involving wars/ politics

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
I can't even imagine how this class is gonna go

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
But i mean. A bunch of people in there were in my 8th grade class

Steph DudakWednesday, September 7, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
And we had mr lee then too

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 7:07pm EDT
have you actually started doing stuff in world lit?

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:31pm EDT
we started a biographical essay tofay, due on tuesday

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:32pm EDT
today*

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:32pm EDT
delay was cause by guard not my inattention to facebook

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:33pm EDT
Alrighty. And that's alright yo

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
blegh I have so much to do!!!

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
Stress is something I dislike the feeling of

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
I think I'm quiting everything soon

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
You have to prioritize and work around your schedule

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
Do you have a study hall?

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:40pm EDT
Well yeah but I can't configure my laptop and install programs there, or cook dinner

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:40pm EDT
or buy pants/ socks for tomorrow by 5

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:40pm EDT
but I am leaving everything else till study hall

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:40pm EDT
O lol. Well you can do that right after school tomorrow

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:41pm EDT
The pants and socks thing

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:41pm EDT
Cook dinner now!

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:41pm EDT
Unless you already did idk

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:41pm EDT
It's cooking

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
Excellent. And you can configure your laptop and install programs between those little things. Problem solved.

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
I'm not used to doing multiple things at once, especially important things

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:45pm EDT
See then you'll just have to take some time to get used to it.

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:46pm EDT
I can't wait til school really starts so I can see what a usual work load is going to be like.

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:46pm EDT
So far I've had world lit hw everyday this week

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:46pm EDT
Omg AP *

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:47pm EDT
OMG WHAT?!

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:49pm EDT
AP lit homework everyday. First day: write a page "what is literature?". Yesterday I had to find a poem in my 2000+ page textbook, read it, and bc I didn't go today, read it out loud in class tmrw and talk about it. Today I had to ~research (lawl) a short story, novel, or poem, etc, about 9/11 and I need to bring it or info about it in tomorrow for a class discussion.

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT
I also have a physics test this Tuesday or Wednesday depending on what we get done and a pre calc test coming up too. I need a planner.

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT
are we getting them thisyear?

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT
We better get them and we better get them soon

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
Last year they took forever to give em out.

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
Seriously? That's interesting lol

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 10:00pm EDT
i thought so, mostly because i was wearing a shirt that had monkeys burning homework on it

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 10:01pm EDT
Omg hahaha

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 10:01pm EDT
Perfect school picture day shirt

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 10:02pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT
Sounds like something my brother would wear. Well on a normal day. He hates school. And he's 12.

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT
He had pictures today actually o.O

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 10:05pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
Yeahh. I don't like drawing people or myself

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 10:40pm EDT
so i'm gonna guess that I didn't

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT
Damn it. Before that I said. It's cause by then we'll all know how to properly draw a face

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 10:45pm EDT
Technology these days

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
but ignore that part

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:07pm EDT
hahahaha you reblog the lazy one

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
Of course hahah

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
My messages keep telling me they send but then disappear whatthe heck

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:12pm EDT
i've only gottne this message for the past 27 minutes

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:16pm EDT
I'm so bad at writing

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:16pm EDT
these 30 day challenges take me forever

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:16pm EDT
i ramble so much

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT
30 day challenges are so much fun lol

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
I like reading other people's. It's interesting.

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
i just assume no one reads mine since they're so long, thus I just write whatever in them

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
Reading other peoples is fun though

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
it's hard to reply since a lot of them i wouldn't want to like, and it feels like too persoanl to talk to them about what they wrote

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
unless its like random maga anime tv show challenge

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
those are different

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
I read your challenge answers lol

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
?!

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
i hope you missed the one about the rock

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
I read that one completely

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
And my other fucking message didn't send again. I said it's kinda entertaining bc I read the things you write in your voice and I've heard you ramble and go off about something so lol

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:26pm EDT
yeah I write how I talk, too lazy to actually change my syntax

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:26pm EDT
are you using ipod?

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:26pm EDT
Unfortunately

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
I still can't type on it bc it's on like a dock. My alarm clock.

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
So I keep backspacing and kdlakgjn it's a pain

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
i can empathize, i am stalling switching to ipod until I finish tumblr junk

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
I need to get a job

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
Then invest in a laptop. Big time.

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:34pm EDT
i believe you are completely correct

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:39pm EDT
I should get on that womp. Not to mention whenever it is I actually start driving I'll need to have gas money so.

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:39pm EDT
So much stuffs to do this year

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:45pm EDT
I KNOW

Nick DevlinThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:46pm EDT
i am learning how to drive manual before september is over, i am getting annoyed of asking for rides.

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:52pm EDT
Excellent! A very good idea

Steph DudakThursday, September 8, 2011 at 11:56pm EDT
Okay I need to gtfo tumblr and try to sleep so I'm not completely dead tomorrow. Wish me luck. Goodnight!

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:00am EDT
Night, i will sleep after i start a debate about 9/11 with krystin

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:00am EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:01am EDT
but have fun sleeping and whatnot

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:01am EDT
Yeah now I'm reading that -_-

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:01am EDT
I just got out of a discussion about religion, now I'm reading through this.

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:02am EDT

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:02am EDT
Kevin

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:03am EDT
I don't entirely agree with kristyn on this but I'm too lazy to type everything out on here and whatnot.

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:03am EDT
I've been reflagging kittens all night while she's been arguing lol

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:03am EDT
I noticed

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
I've been doing a lot of books tonight

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
I assume yk what I mean when I say reflagging

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
i guessed

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
So ill no longer correct myself

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:04am EDT
thats fine

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:06am EDT
first she talks to her idol on twitter like 4 times and now she is tumblr famous

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:06am EDT
I think she's moving on to bigger things

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:08am EDT
She's a nut haha

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:08am EDT
just a little one

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:12am EDT
I was joking about sleeping btw. For some reason my dash has become extremely active

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:12am EDT
Moar kittens

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:14am EDT
i was serious about getting onto ipod once i was done with tumblr

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:14am EDT
but thats not happening any time soon

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:18am EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:21am EDT
I should have been sleeping two hours ago

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:21am EDT
this 30 day challenge started in july for me I think

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
nope

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
1st week of august

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
still though, bit longer than 30 days i think

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:24am EDT
Do you not make up for days you miss?

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:24am EDT
Cause I do that. I'll do two in one day if I missed a day.

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
i used to

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
but the 30 days ended half an hour ago actually

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
i've just been doing them whenever I got around to it for the past week or two

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:28am EDT
Yeah I kinda figured lol eh it doesn't really matter

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:28am EDT
You don't really have to do them consecutively

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:28am EDT
I was going to do a school one for the first da of school

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:28am EDT
but i couldn't find any

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:31am EDT
oh well, and i think krystin is over her 15 minutes of fame

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:32am EDT
Hope she knows that

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:33am EDT
she's the one that stopped it

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:33am EDT
If someone reblogs her post and say adds something. And someone likes that reblogged post, itll send her the note too

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:34am EDT
Since it's her original post.

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:34am EDT
i saw her complain about it

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:34am EDT
So it's not necessarily the original post itself that people are agreeing or disagreeing with

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:34am EDT
i want to send it to a bunch of big pro america tumblrs

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:35am EDT
its the discussions following her main post

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:35am EDT
Most likely yes

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:36am EDT
wrasdftdrsgfhtrs

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:36am EDT
wtf?

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:36am EDT
like seriously

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:36am EDT
The thing is. Im sure if it were the reverse and it was Americans that did something like this to someone else and everyone was generalized she'd have a different opinion

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:37am EDT
If she was the one being put into this generalization of people.

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:38am EDT
I was thinking that as i replied to her message. but i didn't want to point it out

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:40am EDT
I was going to but I didn't feel like getting into a debate

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:40am EDT
Cause that was back when I actually planned to sleep

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:40am EDT
well that plan is a bit shot now

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:42am EDT
Just a little bit

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:42am EDT
I took a three hour nap earlier

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:42am EDT
Went to bed at one last night.

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:42am EDT
My sleeping schedule is still all messed up. It's like in sill in summer mode but with an alarm set.

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:42am EDT
And less wow.

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:44am EDT
sounds fun

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:44am EDT
i noticed "less wow" as opposed to no wow

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:46am EDT
Well I haven't played in a few days but yeah lol.

Steph DudakFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:46am EDT
I say less cause I'll play on weekends when I'm busy having no life.

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:47am EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, September 9, 2011 at 12:47am EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 2:56pm EDT
yes

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 2:57pm EDT
considering you don't say hello/hi/hey to me, i assume STEPH means hello.

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 2:57pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 2:58pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:19pm EDT
so basically I am able to do well in an advanced class I am not even taking while discussing a book I only read the summary of?

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:19pm EDT
and homework is the reason I am not taking it btw

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:19pm EDT
she's like the only ap teacher that gives this much homework.

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:19pm EDT
well idk lol

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:20pm EDT
no she isn't

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:20pm EDT
but last years ap class was a joke compared to this.

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:20pm EDT
like forreal

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:20pm EDT
SHUSH I DONT NEED AN EXPLANATION OF WHO GIVES HOW MUCH HOMEWORK

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:20pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:20pm EDT
?

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:20pm EDT
but i'm sure i'll be getting hw everyday for the rest of the year up until the ap exam

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:20pm EDT
yes

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:20pm EDT
i'm sure

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:21pm EDT
tonight i need to read pages 1-9 in one of the textbooks, fill out the yellow review sheet for this, and then write sentences that are due friday

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:21pm EDT
and we have a quiz on those words friday i think

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:21pm EDT
there's like 10 i think though so

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:21pm EDT
10 words?

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:22pm EDT
we have 80 verbs in our spanish 4 class on Friday :D

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:22pm EDT
still hate Antonio

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:22pm EDT
what is it just telling the english equivalent or defining them in spanish or

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:22pm EDT
and haha antonio

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:22pm EDT
its really really easy actually

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:23pm EDT
but tis still 80 words

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:23pm EDT
and for some reason we are translating from spanish to english

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:23pm EDT
which is something that is very bad to do when learning a language at this level

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:24pm EDT
well that's easy then

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:24pm EDT
if it's just translating it hah

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:25pm EDT
the way you are describing the class makes me think I could totally pass it without trying

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:25pm EDT
what period is it?

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:26pm EDT
6th

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:27pm EDT
I could switch from art II without feeling too bad, but I knda don't wanna

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:27pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:27pm EDT
afuisdjk

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:27pm EDT
Now I am thinking

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:27pm EDT
if you get a 4 or 5 on the exam

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:27pm EDT
I hate thinking

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:27pm EDT
i think some colleges accept 3 but probably very few

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:29pm EDT
yeah if it's just based on the exam I don't really feel like it

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:29pm EDT
but I do

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:29pm EDT
But I don't

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:31pm EDT
I'll ignore it till I stop thinking about it

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:31pm EDT
problem solved

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 3:32pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:31pm EDT
-.-

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:31pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:34pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:35pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:35pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:35pm EDT
5:45

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:36pm EDT
not all too fun

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:36pm EDT
averaeg time when you fall asleep?

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:36pm EDT
oh gosh

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:37pm EDT
hm

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:38pm EDT
well it was definitely after 11, i can say that

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:38pm EDT
well that is at most 6 and a half hours

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:38pm EDT
exactly

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:39pm EDT
but i feel like it was a lot later than 11

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:39pm EDT
somewhere between 11 and 1. so we'll say 12 cause i think that might be more accurate.

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:39pm EDT
ive been falling asleep at around 1ish everyday recently except last night

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:39pm EDT
well the healthy amount of sleep for teenagers is about 9 hours

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:40pm EDT
most can deal with like 8 and catch up on weekends

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:40pm EDT
less than that just makes life suck! :D

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:40pm EDT
yeah i get about that much on weekends lol

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:42pm EDT
i don't even know when I sleep anymore, I just read till I'm tired on weekdays

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:46pm EDT
yeah, usually i'm up doing nothing or staying on tumblr too late. issues

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:47pm EDT
/ doing homework

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:47pm EDT
it took forever for me to get that paragraph thing written yesterday

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:48pm EDT
I just did my essay in the morning

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:48pm EDT
I almost printed it out without fixing it

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:48pm EDT
I don't think Having my entire conclusion paragraph being "I am awesome"

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:48pm EDT
would have gone over too well

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:49pm EDT
haaa i wonder how that would've turned out

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:49pm EDT
I think I'm going to make a watermark on all my papers saying I am awesome

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:50pm EDT
she won't see it unless she looks really really hard

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:50pm EDT
speaking of watermarks

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:51pm EDT
and this is totally unrelated but i just noticed it

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:51pm EDT
http://womp-coolyourjets.tumblr.com/ the four links in the boxes on the side, the bottom two are a few pixels off and it's bothering me.

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:52pm EDT
I wasn't gonna say anything

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:52pm EDT
since i thought you'd just tell me to shut up

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:52pm EDT
and no one cares

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:52pm EDT
I got used to it though

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:52pm EDT
it's been like that forever

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:52pm EDT
and it's been bothering me forever

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:52pm EDT
but i can't seem to fix it

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:53pm EDT
there are a billion things that annoy me about mine

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:53pm EDT
I'm just too lazy to fix

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:53pm EDT
It's mostly the fault of my theme

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:54pm EDT
I really have no clue how you change something like that though

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:54pm EDT
I am pretty sure you can't

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:54pm EDT
the thing is like

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:55pm EDT
hold on

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:55pm EDT
i'll show you my dilemma

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:55pm EDT

mmhmmm

<div class="navi">

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:56pm EDT
that is basically what makes up those links

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:57pm EDT
yep it is

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:58pm EDT
I can guess as to what you might change in that code in order to fix

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:58pm EDT
but I can't be sure it would work

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 4:58pm EDT
please make a suggestion lol

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:03pm EDT
div.navi a{ text-align: center; padding:3px 0px; color: #a1c622; background-color: #e1ebb1; border: 1px solid #b6d81e; margin-top:2px; position:relative; width: 85px; -moz-box-shadow: 0 0 0px #000000; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 0px #000000; display: inline-block; } div.navi a:hover{ color: #ffffff; background-color: #e1ebb1; border: 1px dotted #b6d81e; z-index:2; } }

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:03pm EDT
that might do something

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:03pm EDT
if not

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:04pm EDT
I can try again by changing something else

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:04pm EDT
and what did you change?

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:04pm EDT
i removed the 3 pixels of padding

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:04pm EDT
nope

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:04pm EDT
tried that

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:04pm EDT
it makes the rectangles shorter in height

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:04pm EDT
did you try changing the width to 82?

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:05pm EDT
that just shortens the width of the rectangles

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:06pm EDT
all of them?

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:06pm EDT
yeah

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:06pm EDT
hmm I'm going to guess you also tried changing the top margin

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:07pm EDT
that changes the space in between the two sets of rectangles

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:08pm EDT
yeah I didn't think that would work

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:09pm EDT
My orignal thought was that the relative positioning was where the problem was

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:09pm EDT
but I have no clue how to fix that

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:09pm EDT
its not

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:09pm EDT
even removing that does nothing

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:09pm EDT
but

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:09pm EDT
if you take out

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:09pm EDT
it's like.. display: inline-block;

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:10pm EDT
that makes all of them go side by side, and just big enough to fit the words

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:11pm EDT
and it's not like each one is in an individual box where i can just change number values

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:11pm EDT
no no, I mean that actual coding of the method relative has flaws

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:12pm EDT
so you you have to write an entire new code in machine language

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:12pm EDT
which i can't do

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:12pm EDT
and removing it will not help

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:12pm EDT
it's basically irrelevant

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:14pm EDT
well seeing as you've tried all the obvious solutions

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:14pm EDT
there isn't much else I can think of

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:14pm EDT
I don't think there's much you can do without professional help

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:15pm EDT
x.x

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:15pm EDT
or at least someone better than me

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:15pm EDT
you don't need professional help for something like this lol

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:15pm EDT
it's been a while. a few years ago i would've been able to code this whole thing myself and we wouldn't be having these problems.

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:16pm EDT
when did you do coding stuff?

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:16pm EDT
back in 6th-8th grade.

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:16pm EDT
started off on a website called buddy4u.com , making layouts and shit

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:16pm EDT
escalated to this; http://www.synyster.ourworkofart.com/ fun little thing

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:17pm EDT
also back in my forum days lol

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:17pm EDT
actually

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:17pm EDT
the last update on there was during sophomore year

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:17pm EDT
so

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:18pm EDT
so lame

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:19pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:19pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:19pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:19pm EDT
I can't stop laughing

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:19pm EDT
you were awesome

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:19pm EDT
what happened?

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:19pm EDT
-.-

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:19pm EDT
JEE THANKS.

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:19pm EDT
that was basically my life throughout middle school & a little more than 1/4 of high school

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:20pm EDT
did you read that last update?

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:20pm EDT
I AM SO SORRY TO EVERYBODY. I never update this thing & asdfghjkl ugh. Okay. So let's see. I haven't updated since... SEPTEMBER 13TH :O!!!

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:20pm EDT
what day is today?

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:24pm EDT
:O

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:24pm EDT
that's today

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:24pm EDT
TWO YEARS AGO EXACTLY

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:26pm EDT
That is so creepy

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:26pm EDT
did you make the photoshop tutorials?

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:26pm EDT
omg ajdkhgsdlfh all this old stuff

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:27pm EDT
i was such a faggot at some points though like you don't even understand. i dunno how i got away with being allowed on the internet.

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:28pm EDT
Well I find it odd that I agreed with half your likes/ interests pages, and hated you for the other half

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:28pm EDT
so

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:28pm EDT
did you make the tutorials?

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:32pm EDT
hmm actually the only thing I actually hated was the trnsformers thing

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:32pm EDT
everything else seemed not stupid

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:32pm EDT
which is odd

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:32pm EDT
but you do for some reason list a knight's tale and click, both of which I thought were awesome

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:33pm EDT
a knight's tale is such a good movie

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:34pm EDT
sdlkhjfkhjfh I HATE READING THROUGH THESE THINGS lol omg

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:35pm EDT
my mood has changed from mildly amused

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:35pm EDT
to highly entertained

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:35pm EDT
in case you were wondering

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:36pm EDT
thank you for sharing. XD.

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:36pm EDT
oh, and yes i did make the tutorials

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:36pm EDT
reafgragnfjthRG?!?!?

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:37pm EDT
I sit here for months wodering how the hell to even start somethign on photoshop

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:37pm EDT
and you're off making websites?!!?

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:37pm EDT
3 years ago?!?!

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:37pm EDT
i know for a fact that i cheated on the curves one though

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:37pm EDT
yeeeah

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:37pm EDT
like i said that was my life

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:37pm EDT
AND

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:37pm EDT
AT THAT POINT

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:37pm EDT
well a little before that. before i got this computer and redid all my tutorials and stuff

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:38pm EDT
i was the only one who'd use our computer bc it was so slow and stuff

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:38pm EDT
rollovers are fun

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:38pm EDT
this wasn't the first either.

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:38pm EDT
before this, i had a freewebs

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:39pm EDT
after that freewebs, i had a subdomain hosted by this guy joe

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:39pm EDT
attention.pill-pop.net i remember it specifically.

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:39pm EDT
Joe seems like a nice guy

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:39pm EDT
eventually that had to go

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:39pm EDT
but he helped me a lot

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:39pm EDT
HE WAS

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:39pm EDT
he was freakin awesome

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:39pm EDT
I read about him on your sitre

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:40pm EDT
i forgot about that page

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:40pm EDT
I found all the pages don't worry

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:41pm EDT
you do know that I can't stop thinking of my immortals every time I see the word synyster

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:42pm EDT
lmao

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:42pm EDT
YEAH AND TIFF YOU KNOW TIFF. she used to do all this stuff with me. mainly on b4u but yeah. i'm reading through this

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:42pm EDT
fkjhf

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:43pm EDT
I found the obliteresqueblablabla thing very funny as well

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:44pm EDT
That was the weirdest thing lol. One of the first layouts featured the Veronicas. But that one didn't last long at all.

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:45pm EDT
I'm going to have to find a way to use that site

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:45pm EDT
Bc then tiff and the girl, idk if I mention it but her actual name was Hilary, kinda stopped with that stuff so.

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:46pm EDT
That's how I kept myself busy.

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:47pm EDT
better than what I did

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:47pm EDT
forums were so cool

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:48pm EDT
ohmygod

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:48pm EDT
it still works!

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:48pm EDT
my old password is so stupid

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:49pm EDT
not that my new one is any better

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:49pm EDT
but still

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:53pm EDT
all the forums i was on

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:53pm EDT
are now gone lol

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:53pm EDT
we tried so hard to keep it going but it failed

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:54pm EDT
last would be vuze mb

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:55pm EDT
i think that one is finally gone

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:57pm EDT
I think all mine are still up and running

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:57pm EDT
like people still go there

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:57pm EDT
its really weird

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:57pm EDT
I recognize some usernames

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:57pm EDT
they've upgraded everything so it's all shiny

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:58pm EDT
oh gosh

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:58pm EDT
and new looking

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:58pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:58pm EDT
its has had 100 active users

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:58pm EDT
in the past 15 minutes

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:58pm EDT
I guess it got pretty popular

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:59pm EDT
Maybe I shouldn't have lef

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:59pm EDT
left*

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:59pm EDT
jeeez hahah

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:59pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 5:59pm EDT
no clue what's with the icon

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:00pm EDT
but yeah

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:00pm EDT
http://lightsmb.com/ i was on that for a bit, after one of the forums i was originally on started going. i dont think i was like legitimately on it though

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:01pm EDT
http://flauntymb.com/ that was first. it was run by a girl named emilee i think. but it looked more like lights back in the day. but then it shut down, so most of us moved and made a new one ourselves.

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:01pm EDT
then it went back up and skdjkdlhjfkh

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:01pm EDT
quite a while later though

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:05pm EDT
You seem like really involved in the things you do

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:05pm EDT
I mostly just kind of creeped around reading other posts

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:05pm EDT
and occasionally made comments in the conversations

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:14pm EDT
oh yeah

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:15pm EDT
no i was like in the conversations, i was an admin on two of the forums

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:15pm EDT
cause we had our little ~group. a bunch of those people i'm friends with on here

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:15pm EDT
but i don't really talk to em anymore lol

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:15pm EDT
damn, I only have mod/ admin status on my minecraft forum

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:16pm EDT
and even that is only on the server not actually in the forum

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:16pm EDT
yeah lol did all that stuff. worked on themes and the colour schemes. that stuff was fun XD

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:19pm EDT
that is pretty awesome, not gonna lie

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:26pm EDT
glad you think so lol. without all that stuff, i don't think i'd be where i'm at now.

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:27pm EDT
i definitely wouldn't have taken computer graphics freshman year.

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:28pm EDT
yep I think the same thing about that forum

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:28pm EDT
most of the books I read

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:28pm EDT
it's really weird. like thinking about all the little things that change your entire life

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:28pm EDT
like i constantly look back on those things

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:29pm EDT
constantly.

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:29pm EDT
and think what if?

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:29pm EDT
:D

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:30pm EDT
if i didn't move out of bloomfield, i wouldn't have moved here. i wouldn't have become friends with tiff, i wouldn't have even discovered buddy4u, then the forums, and do the whole subdomain thing. i wouldn't have continued on with computer and art classes as my main enjoyment out of school. i'd be a completely different person.

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:30pm EDT
yeah lol

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:30pm EDT
i wrote like a freakin novel for one of those 30 day posts omg i didn't expeect it to get so long

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:31pm EDT
I did! but that's because I always go on tangents like that

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:31pm EDT
and my what ifs are insane

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:31pm EDT
i have to stop myelf

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:31pm EDT
I start plotting the repercussions of every thought I did or didn't have

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:32pm EDT
Things like my juggling, or discovering vlogbrothers on youtube, randomly joining colorguard last june

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:33pm EDT
those things are so important and they started on such an off chance

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:34pm EDT
i always look back on the little things i didn't do

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:34pm EDT
and then it pisses me off cause then it woould've caused things to go so much better

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:34pm EDT
but it's too late lo

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:34pm EDT
l

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:35pm EDT
well i know i always think of amazing comebacks

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:35pm EDT
like 3 days aftera conversation

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:35pm EDT
LIKE LAST YEAR WHEN WE HAD TO DO DEBATES

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:35pm EDT
ugh yes

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:36pm EDT
i always think of this awesome thing i could've said, meanwhile i'm walking down my street coming home from school.

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:37pm EDT
I like writing online that way, it gives you a chance to think and edit what you say without seeming weird

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:37pm EDT
just pausing and staring off into space for 3 minutes

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:37pm EDT
hahahaha that'd be kinda funny though

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:38pm EDT
not if it happened for every single reply

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:38pm EDT
which I tend to do

Steph DudakTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:41pm EDT
welll that'd be awful then

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 13, 2011 at 6:42pm EDT
Which is why I either say nothing or just say something stupid

Steph DudakFriday, September 16, 2011 at 10:06pm EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, September 16, 2011 at 10:07pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:06pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:07pm EDT
my life revolved around cake

Nick DevlinSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:07pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:07pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:07pm EDT
omg haha

Steph DudakSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:09pm EDT
i seriously laughed at that a lot

Nick DevlinSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:10pm EDT
i'm glad I laughed at it a lot too, so I kinda felt like a loser for laughing at a joke i hadn't even written

Steph DudakSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:20pm EDT
That's okay

Steph DudakSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:20pm EDT
That is a perfect joke

Nick DevlinSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:21pm EDT
i'm probably gonna use it like 10 more times, glad i had this conversation in order to think of it

Nick DevlinSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:21pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:24pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:25pm EDT
Well they'll know once you say it

Steph DudakSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:25pm EDT
So basically, you can't go wrong with telling that to people

Nick DevlinSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:27pm EDT
very well i shall setup this joke for weeks leaving hints of cake obsession

Nick DevlinSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:27pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:27pm EDT
and i will become master of the universe

Nick DevlinSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:27pm EDT
the end

Steph DudakSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:30pm EDT
I'm sure that's exactly how it'll happen

Nick DevlinSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:30pm EDT
i think so too

Nick DevlinSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:30pm EDT
then everyone will bake me plain chocolate cake with nothing on it

Nick DevlinSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:30pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:47pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:47pm EDT
Just plain cake

Nick DevlinSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:47pm EDT
plain *chocolate* cake

Steph DudakSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:48pm EDT
Plain chocolate cake, my bad. So do you not like cake with icing on it? Or you just don't prefer it?

Nick DevlinSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:49pm EDT
i don't like icing

Nick DevlinSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:53pm EDT
...

Nick DevlinSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:53pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:53pm EDT
-_-

Nick DevlinSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:54pm EDT
we should really be talking about YOUR preferences in cake

Steph DudakSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:58pm EDT
I like ice cream cake

Steph DudakSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:58pm EDT
I don't really like cake. But I like cupcakes.

Nick DevlinSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:58pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:59pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:59pm EDT
Or cupcakes?

Nick DevlinSunday, September 18, 2011 at 7:59pm EDT
there's a difference?

Steph DudakSunday, September 18, 2011 at 8:01pm EDT
Uh duh? It doesn't matter what kinda ice cream cake. Chocolate, vanilla. Both. Whatever. Has to have those crunchy things in the middle. And I like vanilla cupcakes.

Steph DudakSunday, September 18, 2011 at 8:01pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, September 19, 2011 at 10:16pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, September 20, 2011 at 6:06am EDT
Are they okay? O.o and why don't you text Kerry or someone and ask her if she can drive you.

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 20, 2011 at 6:08am EDT
I have literally no clue, my mom just called and told me about it, she didn't sound like panicked so I'm guessing shes somewhat ok

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 20, 2011 at 6:08am EDT
And I'm allowed to do that? I never texted anyone for a ride

Steph DudakTuesday, September 20, 2011 at 6:09am EDT

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:18pm EDT
okay lets say i wrote this

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:18pm EDT
After what seemed to be an eternity of examining and handling the sword and asking herself tons of questions, Alesca decided to continue on to meet Brother Thomas, taking the sword with her. Maybe hell know whose it is, she thought to herself. Unfortunately, Brother Thomas was not able to give Alesca any useful information about the sword.

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:18pm EDT
should i separate

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:18pm EDT
Unfortunately . . .

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:18pm EDT
into a second paragraph?

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
you should do it anyway, just because you are changing thought

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
yes you are making unfortunately a new paragraph

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
thank you lol

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:20pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:20pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:20pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
i used it twice

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
After what seemed to be an eternity of examining and handling the sword and asking herself tons of questions After what seemed to be an eternity of examining and handling the sword *while* asking herself tons of questions

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
twice is one too many

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
okay

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
you'll have to help me here with replacing words

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
i can't function

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT

Maybe hell know whose it is, she thought to herself. Unfortunately, Brother Thomas was not able to give Alesca any useful information about the sword. However he did suggest that she meet with Cobus -- one of the best Iladarian blacksmiths and a close friend of Alesca.

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
i am editing now

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
After what seemed to be an eternity of examining and handling the sword while asking herself hundreds of questions, Alesca decided to visit Brother Thomas. Maybe hell know whose it is, she thought to herself. Unfortunately, Brother Thomas was not able to give Alesca any useful. He did, however, suggest that she meet with Cobus-- one of the best blacksmiths in Iladria and a close friend of Alesca.

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
information is after the word usefil

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
Iladar

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
is the place they live

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
Iladarian is what they are

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
i just guessed the original name

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
but yeah, the main thing was that you pointed out the sword like 50 times

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
when it was already established that the sword was the main subject

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
today is a bad day for writing

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
thank you

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
also sword noises

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
swish and thwack are the best I got

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
..shink? meh

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
yeah i got nothing

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:50pm EDT
alright this might not work

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
Yserion now resides in a castle to the north

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
should north be capitalized

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
I am thinking yes

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
but I will check

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
no

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
you don't

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
don't capitilize

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
okie

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
wait can you put the sentence in it paragraph?

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
i need to know exactly how north is being used

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
there are like 10 rules that could change it

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
Yserion now resides in a castle to the north but has been known to come down and destroy lands purely out of anger. jnsp

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
to the north of their present location?

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
or in the northern part of country?

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
eh i shouldn't make it northern part of their country

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
because

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
yserion kinda destroys the eastern part of it

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
so if they are using it in reference to their current location

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
it is not capitalized

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
k

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
we'll do that

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
kk

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:02pm EDT
k

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:02pm EDT
hahah

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT
i'm so funny

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT
skgjklhjklhjrelkhj

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT
IT'S GETTING SO LATE.

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT
what if i just handwrite this o.o. no i can't.

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT
BUT I HAVE THREE PAGES TO WRITE, then i gotta finish the story

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT
ok time to go into hyperspeed mode

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT
or somethin glike that

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:04pm EDT
good idea

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:04pm EDT
One does not simply walk into Estraza's temple!

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:04pm EDT
in thwe winter

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:04pm EDT
i should totally use that as a line rite. lawl.

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:04pm EDT
do it

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:05pm EDT
Word is shes returned to her temple though and shes planning ahead this time. We should go there and help, Alesca suggested. Cobus immediately stopped moving. One does not simply walk into Estrazas temple!

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
perfect.

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
i'm doing it.

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
i'm not kidding.

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
i just need to complete that thought.

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
why wouldn't you, its not like she'll get any references from it

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:07pm EDT
and if she does then she'll probly just laugh

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:08pm EDT
#winning

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:09pm EDT
cobus is gonna be really nervous and chicken to go at first

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:09pm EDT
yeeeeah

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:09pm EDT
why is he going in first?

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:09pm EDT
nevermind

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:09pm EDT
i read it wrong

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:09pm EDT
I dont think shes gotten to him in time before it was too late. Shes been around aiding other lands and allies these days but word is shes returned to her temple and shes planning ahead this time. We should go there and help, Alesca suggested. Cobus immediately stopped moving. One does not simply walk into Estrazas temple! Do you even think shed accept our help? What do you even mean we should help! Im up for a battle as much as the next guy but Yserions destroyed thousands of people in an instant! Theres no way wed survive! We have our whole lives ahead of us, I cant die yet!

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
i like cobus' character

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
he seems smart

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:13pm EDT
the first piece of dialogue where cobus is talking about estraza makes no sense

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:13pm EDT
I have no clue what you are trying to say

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
you don't need to know

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
what's before it makes it make sense

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
and i need to reword it anyway

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
I dont think shes gotten to him in time before it was too late.

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
it doesn't matter what context that sentence is in

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
I KNOW

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
SHUSH

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
:D

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
I ALREADY FIXED IT

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
sheesh

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
Well I want to know the story!!

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
but that does make sense in my head

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
lots of things make sense in my head

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
doesn't mean anyone else knows what the fuck im talking about

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
things like mlp

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
whyu dont people get it?

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
omg it's 5 pages

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
thats more than 5

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
...3

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
5 is more than 5

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
shush

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
5 3 7 whatever

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
idc

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
i might go to bed and wake up early to finish this.

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
be a good idea

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
sleep is always fun

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:31pm EDT
THIS IS SO AWFUL

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:31pm EDT
what time will i need to wake up?

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:31pm EDT
4?

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
cause 5 i'd only have an hour to write it maybe

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
i still need to shower in the morning

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
and i need them to talk to estraza and then go to yserion's castle, and then defeat him

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
okay this is a shitty paragraph idc but

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
Alesca and Cobus left at dawn the day after. The journey to Estrazas temple was fairly short and easier than they had anticipated, although Cobus did almost run them into a patch of quick sand. But they made it to the temple in a little more than a days travel. While the temple was heavily guarded, Alesca and Cobus were able to easily persuade the guards to let them in once they presented the sword.

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
how can i lead that

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
into

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
no

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
nevermind

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
i'm gonna work on this for a few more mins, go to bed, then wake up super early tomorrow and everything will be fine.

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
procrastination ftl.

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
super early?

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
as in?

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:48pm EDT
Idk

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:49pm EDT
Early. I need to give myself enough time to write it though.

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:50pm EDT
The ending will be rushed. I'm on page 6 but I'm at the point where they're being attacked on the way to Yserion.

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:50pm EDT
Then I just gotta get through that, Yserion and Estraza need to speak a bit, battle will commence, and they win and it's done.

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:50pm EDT
funfun

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:51pm EDT
what perios is it due?

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:51pm EDT
6th

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:51pm EDT
But I'm typing it so that's irrelevant

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:51pm EDT
you probly don't have library access before that period

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:52pm EDT
to edit or anything

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:52pm EDT
Nope

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:52pm EDT
oh well

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:55pm EDT
So yeah I'll be waking up at 4am pretty much.

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:55pm EDT
yay 4 hours of sleep

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:55pm EDT
more likely 3

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:56pm EDT
I can get that done, print it, take a shower, and leave my house at 6:30 right?

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:56pm EDT
probably

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:57pm EDT
Fuck me man. I need to do this stuff earlier from now on. Hopefully this only takes an hour and a half to write at most.

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:57pm EDT
i do homework, feed animals, take shower, and leave at 6:30 and I wake up at 5:30

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:57pm EDT
not including th4 times I snooze

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:57pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:58pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:59pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, September 22, 2011 at 11:59pm EDT

have fun with you essay in 4 hours

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 6:08am EDT
I printed out my essay at like 5:45 lol. And my black ink decided it was gonna start running out. So half my story is like grey, the first page is black, and the rest are a dark blue. 9 fucking pages. Shes gonna kill me.

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 6:08am EDT
I couldn't find a way to shorten it for the life of me. And it's not even that good.

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 6:09am EDT
9 pages?

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 6:09am EDT
i think you could probably edit that an itty bit

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 6:10am EDT
but the ink shouldn't matter

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 6:10am EDT
No. I can't.

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 6:10am EDT
save the document to your email

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 6:10am EDT
I mean yeah if I take out some details I guess. But then they don't have a purpose for anything

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 6:10am EDT
If I do that

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 6:10am EDT
I meant in overall story

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 6:11am EDT
but editing taking longer than writing

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 6:11am EDT
so you couldn't do it before school

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 6:11am EDT
I need to have three adventures in it

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 6:11am EDT
And no. It's staying 9 pages. Idgaf. She can't expect me to write an epic story in 2-3 pages

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 6:12am EDT
It's due today so.

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 6:12am EDT
yeah its not really that important, just turn it in

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 6:12am EDT
I mean if it wasn't double spaced it'd be shorter lol but it's not therefore it isn't.

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 6:13am EDT
hahhaha DOUBLESPACED AND 3 pages epic story

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 6:13am EDT
It makes me mad though cause like. Idk. I didn't want it to get that long. But I'm awful at shortening things to begin with.

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 6:13am EDT
she's out of her mind

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 6:13am EDT
RIGHT?!

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 6:14am EDT
It makes me want to kill myself. But as long as I get a decent grade it's whatever. And she said I was allowed to do more than three pages so it's her fault if she doesn't feel like reading it all lol. Bc she also said there isn't really a limit to how much I can write

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 6:15am EDT
you should have said like 3?

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:14pm EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:17pm EDT
i like the reasons for why yserion is evil

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:17pm EDT
i cant tell if that was sarcasm but i made that up on the spot

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:19pm EDT
i think as i was typing it

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:19pm EDT
i was at the point where i didn't care how it sounded

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:19pm EDT
i just wanted to get it done

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:19pm EDT
no sarcasm

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:20pm EDT
it was better done than I thought it would be

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:21pm EDT
jee thanks lol

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:23pm EDT
well its difficult to create motivation for the bad guy in black and white good vs evil stories

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:25pm EDT
yeah i gotchu

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:26pm EDT
grrr reading this is so annoying

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:26pm EDT
you really should expand this story one day

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:26pm EDT
I'M SORRY

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:26pm EDT
It feels like it'd be awesome if it wasn't so shrunken down

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:26pm EDT
skljhkflhr

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:26pm EDT
and it's 9 pages lol

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:26pm EDT
IMAGINE THIS IN THREE PAGES

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:27pm EDT
I KNOw

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:28pm EDT
I think the only major thing that was weird, besides the rushed pace, was how they talked

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:28pm EDT
I got used to it

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:28pm EDT
So basically write this story for real

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:28pm EDT
i felt like

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:29pm EDT
the way i made alesca and cobus talk, is the way i'd talk kinda lol. know what i mean? estraza's a little more proper. a little. annd. yeah it doesn't necessarily take place in the past so

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:29pm EDT
they talk exactly how you talk

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:30pm EDT
i wasn't gonna point it out

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:30pm EDT
exactly lol

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:30pm EDT
i noticed that as i was writing it

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:30pm EDT
and i was like EH

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:30pm EDT
not everyone talks in perfect, proper english and everything. i'll just let them talk how i talk and it'll be all good and dandy.

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:31pm EDT
although i understand that that could get annoying depending on who's reading it

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:31pm EDT
It doesn't particulary fit the setting, but I got used to it near the end

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:32pm EDT
which should have been the end of the first chapter If your teacher was cool enough to actually let you right an epic

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:32pm EDT
then again i didn't make any very vivid descriptions of the places they were at

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:34pm EDT
there were lots of cool things that could be added, but not really cuse of time and text limit

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:36pm EDT
i could've done a lot more with this for sure

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:36pm EDT
if i wasn't so limited

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:37pm EDT
its the man putting you down

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:37pm EDT

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:54pm EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:55pm EDT
a bit

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:55pm EDT

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 2:55pm EDT

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 3:04pm EDT

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 3:04pm EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 3:04pm EDT

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 3:04pm EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 3:50pm EDT

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 3:51pm EDT
we wiped three times. this is not hard

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 3:51pm EDT
the people you playing with suck?

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 3:52pm EDT
we dont have a lotta control on the spirits

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 3:52pm EDT
cause we have 2 melee and only one ranged

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 3:53pm EDT
sounds annoying

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 3:55pm EDT
so like

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 3:55pm EDT
theyre just dumb

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 3:55pm EDT
the tank was pulling the beserkers that had to break the bubbles on the chains out too quick

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 3:56pm EDT
like before we had other chains down

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 3:56pm EDT
and to break the bubbles you need to stand by a chain and the berserker body slams someone

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 3:56pm EDT
and it breaks

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 3:56pm EDT
if you miss a slam it's annoying bc then no broken bubble, therefore no broken down chain, therefore lose

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 3:57pm EDT
and losing causes fdsnajlsnerdf to be typed

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 3:57pm EDT
exactly

Nick DevlinFriday, September 23, 2011 at 3:58pm EDT
are you trying again?

Steph DudakFriday, September 23, 2011 at 3:59pm EDT

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 24, 2011 at 12:24am EDT
And if you've only had her for two day she might not actually be quiet, she might just be getting used to new place

Nick DevlinSaturday, September 24, 2011 at 12:24am EDT
Then once she knows she lives there shell start being more annoying
