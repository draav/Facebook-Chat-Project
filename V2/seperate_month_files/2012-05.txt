Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:00pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:01pm EDT
oh

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:01pm EDT
word

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:01pm EDT
nick i have no brain anymore

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:01pm EDT
it's okay

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:01pm EDT
i haven't been able to pick up on clever little things lately

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:01pm EDT
wasn't harry's a dementor though

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:01pm EDT
not in the first meeting

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:02pm EDT
harry wasn't allowed because lupin thought it would be voldemort

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:02pm EDT
word word gotchu

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:02pm EDT
dementer would have been funnier though

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:06pm EDT
how are you doing with your things?

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:07pm EDT
eh

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:07pm EDT
i'm at my grams right now

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:07pm EDT
going home in a little bit

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:07pm EDT
i'm really nervous that i'm not gonna finish everything

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:08pm EDT
obviously it's something out of my control and it's my fault for letting it happen but you know i'm also nervous that some of these, don't. i don't wanna say accurately, but for lack of a better word yeah accurately, depict the disorder i'm going for

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:08pm EDT
i understand what you mean

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:08pm EDT
like it makes sense to me. but it doesn't matter if it makes sense to me because it's the people grading it that it has to make sense to. and i mean i ask people i'm friends with for opinions on my pieces and i tell em what it is and blahblahblah and they'll be like oh yeah i get it it's awesome but i feel like some of them

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:08pm EDT
not you really

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
are just saying it cause they're my friends

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
and aren't giving me any real criticism cause then i walk into physics and carolyn stumbles upon whatever i have done

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
but i hate when she looks at my art projects

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
i feel her judging me hardcore and i can tell she doesn't like most of what i do which i don't care she can fuck off but it's annoying

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:10pm EDT
Cause explaining to her what goes through my head and how a certain piece even remotely makes sense

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:10pm EDT
just

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:10pm EDT
no

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:11pm EDT
she does that "eeuuuuhhhhh mmmm ahljdh" thing But that's one person But also calicch hasn't seen ANY of this stuff So I'm scared about that too But that's another thing I just need to deal with I mean at least I'll have stuff handed in

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:11pm EDT
Although I know the quality of some of it isn't the best it could be

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:12pm EDT
it is the best it can be at your current pace

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:12pm EDT
and I understand that other people undestanding it might be somewhat important

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:13pm EDT
but really

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:13pm EDT
half the shit in museums i have no clue what it means till someone explains it

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:13pm EDT
you also have a very centralized concentration

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:14pm EDT
people don't really know disorders off the top of their heads

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:14pm EDT
i could not tell you the difference between mulitple personality and bipolar and schiztophrenia

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:14pm EDT
without it being explained a bit

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:15pm EDT
and my job is to know random crap like that

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:19pm EDT
I guess I'm just really worried about stuff like that. Next to each other, they look like they kinda work. I think just cause all the colors and stuff yaknow. I just hate explaining these projects to actual people around me. Kerry & Carolynn are the worst cases. I'll be able to type up the thing I have to type up and explain what I'm thinking with each thing.

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:20pm EDT
that should be simpler

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:20pm EDT
as long as you don't fuss over every phrase

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:21pm EDT
no no. i mean i won't have to talk about every ingle piece indiividually. but i will be able to refernce certain things about certain pieces cfor c

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:22pm EDT
oh even better!

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:22pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:23pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:23pm EDT
computer works slower than i do and likes to freeze up and be an asshole apparently

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:23pm EDT
yeah, I've learned to make my speed match the tech around me

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:24pm EDT

Xmen is my favorite of all time

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:32pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:32pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 7:32pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:03pm EDT
"Are you on the computer" 'Yes' "What are you doing" (or something like that or why or some shit) 'I do what I want' "Oh wooooah whatever punk" -walks away-

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:12pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:13pm EDT
i have purposely detatched myself from people who write like that

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:13pm EDT
on at least 3 occasions that i can remember

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:15pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:16pm EDT
http://www.rgbstock.com/cache1pJuNt/users/t/ta/tacluda/300/mP3OIEU.jpg can this be repeated

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:16pm EDT
like tiled

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:16pm EDT
of course

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:16pm EDT
in what sense though

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:17pm EDT
like interlocking the petals

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:17pm EDT
yes

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:17pm EDT
hmmm

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:17pm EDT
i'll look again

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:17pm EDT
i feel like it couldn't, just on its own

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:17pm EDT
there will be empty spaces

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:17pm EDT
but idk

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:17pm EDT
triangular

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:17pm EDT
i can deal with that

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:18pm EDT
you can fit 6 around it

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:18pm EDT
it'll be a somewhat hexagonal pattern

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:19pm EDT
it also will not interlock the petals in a perfect way since there are an even number of petals

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:21pm EDT
hm yeah not good

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:23pm EDT
it'll take a bit of fudging

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:23pm EDT
what are you trying to do?

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:24pm EDT
use something similar for one of my projects

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:25pm EDT
oh that's easy then

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:25pm EDT
if you are making it yourself then you can change it to make it work

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:37pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:38pm EDT
i love those types of designs

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:38pm EDT
like diagrams

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:38pm EDT
since ocd is all detailed

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:40pm EDT
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/GreenCircleFractal.png i really like this thing though. the center circle. http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs32/f/2008/204/4/a/Circular_Motion_by_Expercf.jpg this is really cool http://a1.s6img.com/cdn/box_001/post_11/208027_5681160_ll.jpg that's a cute already been done thing

they have entire tutorials onhow to create circles with specific meanings

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:54pm EDT
the different patterns do different tasks

Nick DevlinThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:54pm EDT
and the inclusion of symbols further specifies what the magic does

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:57pm EDT
one second

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:57pm EDT
omg

Steph DudakThursday, May 3, 2012 at 10:59pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:13am EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:13am EDT
Steph just get as much done as you can

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:13am EDT
She knows that you are behind yes?

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:14am EDT
Nick I HAVE to have everything done by Monday because shes photographing them If I'm a project short or something I'll make up some bullshit that I left it at home

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:14am EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:14am EDT
but will she only be photography them ALL in one day?

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:14am EDT
Yes

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:15am EDT
she can't do more the next day?

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:15am EDT
if so why?

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:15am EDT
She probably could but I can't tell her that I still have more to finish because I was supposed to have everything done last week

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:15am EDT
Monday she's photographing so we have Tuesday and Wednesday to upload and edit everything online

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:16am EDT
In class I still need to mount my five quality pieces

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:16am EDT
Which are what I need to hand in on Friday

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:17am EDT
Everything else needs to be finished and submitted to calicchio before that

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:17am EDT
that sucks

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:17am EDT
I don't know what else to tell you

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:18am EDT
There's nothing anyone can tell me cause I let it happen so whatever

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:18am EDT
Will there be anything horrible due next week?

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:18am EDT
after this Friday it'll mostly be over yeah?

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:19am EDT
Can I send you the 8 I have done though And can you tell me if it looks like it'd fit into a concentration? And yeah I had a fuckload of hw to do. I have a world affairs test on Monday I haven't studied for I have ap lit practice stuff to do that I haven't done yet Mostly it will be yeah But I have a physics test next Monday that I need to get a good grade on

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:19am EDT
GREAT!

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:20am EDT
Then we can spend time on how I have nothing done and I wasted all my time on stupid things!

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:20am EDT
That's not until next week though

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:20am EDT
so I still have time to procrastinate

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:20am EDT

And sounds like a plan haha

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:24am EDT
hmmm the only one that doesn't really fit is the insanity one

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:24am EDT
all the rest have random designs and colours everywhere

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:24am EDT
that one is much more simple

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:24am EDT
Well I need to somehow make it work

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:25am EDT
well when you compare it to synestesia

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:25am EDT
it's similar

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:26am EDT
and the brain itself have similar patterns to what you do

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:26am EDT
just put it after synestesia and you should be good

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:26am EDT
Well I still have four more that I can use to transition into that

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:27am EDT
What if I did OCD kind of like the brain one. Like. Inside the head have a detailed repeating design of some sort Just not shaped like a brain and filling the whole thing

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:28am EDT
Or a hand or something

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:28am EDT
Drawing

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:29am EDT
Im just iffy on doing that bc the rest except add have like a head or something in it

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:30am EDT
I was going to say that you should put a more simple one after like occ

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:30am EDT
ocd

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:31am EDT
fruedian slip

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:31am EDT
so that'd probably work

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:32am EDT
So head or hand for OCD And then I have depression And bipolar And a fourth thing

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:32am EDT
I liked Julie's idea for bipolar with the shadows of the person

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:32am EDT
I contemplated pyromania I really just don't wanna Do anxiety

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:33am EDT

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:37am EDT
But okay depression That can be my gateway simpler one

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:39am EDT
makes sense

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:46am EDT
Somehow You know I don't think I can take stuff from my concentration and my breadth for my quality pieces. Only from one section

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:46am EDT
odd

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:47am EDT
which has more pieces ou like?

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:48am EDT
I'm gonna have to check on that. Neither really I don't feel like any of my stuff is good enough. I'm gonna use the butterfly one and the one with the tears I think But. Idk the thing is they need to be "technically well done" I kind of just do what I want with these. I have like the minimum amount of pieces for everything. My painting isn't good enough. I wish I had more outside stuff but oh we'll

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:48am EDT
Like stuff that wasn't going in my portfolio already

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:51am EDT
i have no

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 8:51am EDT
idea

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:05am EDT
So hand or head for OCD

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:06am EDT
umm

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:06am EDT
head might be easier

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:06am EDT
unless you literally trace your hand

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:07am EDT
Take a picture of what I want it to look like and then print it out and trace it lol

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:08am EDT
then i am not sure

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:08am EDT
umm

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:09am EDT
hand?

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:09am EDT
I just feel like I'd have to do other body parts as a result Like everything's a body shape or a head or face Then Bam Hand

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:09am EDT
just to be different

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:09am EDT
if you want it to be the same i'd go with head

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:09am EDT
That shows profession actually Hand

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:09am EDT
Progression

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:09am EDT
then do a hand

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:10am EDT
OK I'm gonna time myself on this one when I start it. Thank you For your help And listening to me complain As always OFF TO WORK

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:10am EDT
anytime

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:14am EDT
Somethin like that? The pencil could be an actual pencil like a colored pencil or something And then yeah Stuff being drawn and stuff y/n

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:15am EDT
that'd look cool

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:20am EDT
Cool cool ty!

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 10:32am EDT
My drawings officially make no sense

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 10:32am EDT
Just to give you an update

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 12:47pm EDT
i thank you

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 12:47pm EDT
for the update

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 12:50pm EDT
I fixed it. It's making sense. Unfortunately I dont have a ruler in my house for some reason

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 12:50pm EDT
Which is important to have for this one

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 12:51pm EDT
interesting

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 12:51pm EDT
the hand i mean

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 12:51pm EDT
the lack of ruler is annoying

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 12:51pm EDT
have you learned nothing from comp graphics and design?!

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 12:52pm EDT
rulers are for pussies

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 12:52pm EDT
Lmao

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 12:52pm EDT
I'm making boxes though

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 12:52pm EDT
Squares

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 12:52pm EDT
Not boxes

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 12:52pm EDT
And they need to be perfect

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 12:53pm EDT
yeah, and we learned how to make perfect circles and squares and lines in that class

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 12:53pm EDT
plus you can just make a straightedge

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 12:53pm EDT
and print out a ruler if you are that desperate

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 12:54pm EDT
That was like 3 years ago ok

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 12:54pm EDT
yeahh

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 12:54pm EDT
but my other points are still valid

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 12:54pm EDT
They are I remember nothing

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 12:55pm EDT
it's all i learned in high school

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 12:58pm EDT
Obviously it's a useful skill to have

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 12:59pm EDT
better than foiling

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 12:59pm EDT
oh! marrato taught me fractions

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 1:00pm EDT
i learned that

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 1:24pm EDT
Fractions are good

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 1:24pm EDT
Should I color this hand like normal skin

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 1:25pm EDT
I went over the numbers with a thin sharpie like pen

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 1:25pm EDT
yeah

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 1:25pm EDT
i think so

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 1:25pm EDT
unless you have other option for the coloring?

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 1:25pm EDT
and i expected you to do that

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 1:26pm EDT
No I didn't really have an alternative idea

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 1:26pm EDT
then go with it

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 1:26pm EDT
Just didn't know if I wanted it to look like skin lol The face in bulimia is silver and black

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 1:26pm EDT
Meh

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 1:27pm EDT
well you could make it coloured randomly with designs

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 1:27pm EDT
but unles you have ideas, I'm not sure you should waste time trying to think of colour patterns

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 1:29pm EDT
Nope

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 1:29pm EDT
I do however

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 1:29pm EDT
Need to think of the colors for the squares

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 1:29pm EDT
Every seventh is going to be a specific one

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 1:40pm EDT
awesome idea

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 1:41pm EDT
Im gonnna use blue pink violet and yellow Every seventh will be yellow And the pattern will be bbppvvYvvppbbYbbppvvYvvppbb Etc

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 1:43pm EDT
funfun

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 1:43pm EDT
I live it in my head

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 1:43pm EDT
so i'll like even more when i see your drawing of it

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
Not a recent picbut does it look weird skin colored

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 3:40pm EDT
yeah a little

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 3:41pm EDT
all the numbers have a different texture

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 3:43pm EDT
I'm not good at specifics with realistic drawing

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 3:43pm EDT
hmm add more shading?

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 3:43pm EDT
it doesn't seem to have any depth like shadows or anything

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 3:44pm EDT
They're light but I'll do that

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 3:44pm EDT
The goal wasn't for it to look realistic though

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 3:45pm EDT
the outline of the hand is realistic so it messed me up

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 3:45pm EDT
like you have all the lines for a more detailed hand but are missing the shadows

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 3:45pm EDT
so i'ts kinda flat

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 3:46pm EDT
this is from the computer pic though, so there might be some I can't see

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 3:47pm EDT
hm

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 3:47pm EDT
they are light though but i'll fix it when i'm home

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 4:02pm EDT
funfun

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 4:02pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 5:17pm EDT
I don't think sara's allowed at my house while I have a computeron ever again

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 5:17pm EDT
Yeah I know when it's her lol

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 5:18pm EDT

THEY NEED TO BE RECTANGLES ;__;

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 5:44pm EDT
I hate measuring

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 5:44pm EDT
D:

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 5:44pm EDT
Omg

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 5:45pm EDT
why?

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 5:45pm EDT
Because the measurements dont work how I have them like I was an idiot and colored in the pencil

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 5:46pm EDT
It works if I have it in rectangles

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 5:46pm EDT
That sucks

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 5:46pm EDT
2in rectangles that are 1in wide

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 5:46pm EDT
And vertically separated by 1/8

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 5:46pm EDT
as long as it's perfect

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 5:48pm EDT
Shit now the space GRRR THE SPACE BETWEEN THE BLOCKS HORIZONTALLY IS 5/16 THIS IS NOT OKAY

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 5:48pm EDT
I can fix this

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 5:49pm EDT
you got this

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 5:58pm EDT
It's impossible to fix I can't have it be 5/16 apart horizontally though I can't

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 5:58pm EDT
Why cant I do math

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 6:00pm EDT
i really couldn't tell you

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 6:00pm EDT
just scribble all over it

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 6:00pm EDT
then say it wasn't perfect so you couldn't finish

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 6:00pm EDT
thus OCD

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 6:00pm EDT
emmy please

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 6:11pm EDT
Luckily No one notices these things But The width of one box is half of a 16th off I know it But no one else will so it's okay Jesus Christ Your idea is a good back up tho in case anything else goes wrong Which I am intoxicating as always

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 6:11pm EDT
intoxicating?

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 6:13pm EDT
Fucker

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 6:13pm EDT
Anticipating

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 6:13pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 6:14pm EDT
i know, I'm just a dick

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 6:15pm EDT
I need to turn everything off and actually do work

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 6:15pm EDT
talk to you later

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 6:15pm EDT
good luck with the measurements

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 6:16pm EDT
Thank you Good luck with your stuff

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:21pm EDT
Should the rectangles have a design inside cause I feel like it doesn't really fit with the others If I just do it plain colors

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
the design should be there

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
hmm

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
not too intricate

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
but they should be in order somehow

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
like the colours should be in spectrum order

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
Well every 7th rectangle needs to be violet

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
There's only so many ways to count 7 as well

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
?

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
Like. Two.

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
what do you mean?

Steph DudakSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
For that rectangle the purple pencil is under to be purple

Nick DevlinSunday, May 6, 2012 at 9:30pm EDT

i hate when you only know a few words to a song and it gets stuck in your head

Nick DevlinFriday, May 11, 2012 at 11:00pm EDT
YES

Steph DudakFriday, May 11, 2012 at 11:00pm EDT
and you can only sing those couple words over and over cause you don't know the rest so it stays longer

Nick DevlinFriday, May 11, 2012 at 11:01pm EDT
the only solution id to listen to the song on repeat for a week

Nick DevlinFriday, May 11, 2012 at 11:01pm EDT
otherwise the condition can last months

Nick DevlinFriday, May 11, 2012 at 11:02pm EDT

Nick DevlinSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:32am EDT
they would be gods

Steph DudakSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:33am EDT
Omg imagine

Steph DudakSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:33am EDT
No stopping them then

Nick DevlinSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:33am EDT
and why hasn't korra bended air once?

Nick DevlinSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:34am EDT
it's had to have been at least a month since she learned how to 'be the leaf'

Steph DudakSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:34am EDT
Cause it's not her like main element

Steph DudakSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:34am EDT
Still weakest one

Steph DudakSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:34am EDT
Aang mostly air bended

Nick DevlinSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:35am EDT
yeah I suppose

Steph DudakSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:35am EDT
Korra doesn't earth bend all that much either It's funny She water and fire bends a lot

Steph DudakSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:35am EDT
And they're opposites

Nick DevlinSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:35am EDT
which are supposed to be opposites

Nick DevlinSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:35am EDT
mhmm

Nick DevlinSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:36am EDT
i think she's just a water bender that really really wants to be a fire bender

Nick DevlinSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:36am EDT
and happened to get lucky

Nick DevlinSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:36am EDT
and become the avatar

Steph DudakSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:37am EDT
I just don't think she likes air bending cause it frustrates her

Steph DudakSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:37am EDT
She's no twinkle toes

Nick DevlinSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:37am EDT
not at all

Nick DevlinSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:37am EDT
I wonder what her interaction with aang will be like when she does that meditate-y thing and talks to him

Steph DudakSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:37am EDT
I can't wait til that happens

Steph DudakSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:38am EDT
I wonder if she'll have any interaction with any other cool spirit world stuff Like how Aang did with Koh and the owl guy from the library I forget his name

Nick DevlinSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:38am EDT
i just imagine aang being all add and excited about meeting korra

Nick DevlinSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:38am EDT
when korra is calling for help during an emergency

Nick DevlinSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:38am EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:40am EDT

Nick DevlinSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:40am EDT

Nick DevlinSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:44am EDT
I imagine him just asking a million questions

Nick DevlinSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 11:44am EDT
"Hi! Is it fun being avatar? I loved it"

Steph DudakSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 12:26pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, May 12, 2012 at 12:26pm EDT
Earth bending >> metal bending Fire bending >> lightning bending Water bending >> blood bending and then there's air bending

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 6:44pm EDT
What exactly is your work for world lit? I need to do my dumb budget project and "bag of me" project for health. Gonna kill myself. I'm currently workin on my pre calc take home test. 4/8 so far, I'd have definitely failed this if I'd taken it in class

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 6:44pm EDT
that sucks

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 6:44pm EDT
i will give you what she gave us

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 6:45pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 6:46pm EDT
Is it like a report? Like a paper that you need to write?

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 6:46pm EDT
it's on a posterboard

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 6:46pm EDT
I'm assuming it needs little to no work

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 6:47pm EDT
Seems basically like lists of shit no one cares about

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 6:47pm EDT
Some bullets may be required it seems

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 6:48pm EDT
I'm not doing that

This is one of the worst math tests I've ever taken

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:08pm EDT
is it about identities?

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:10pm EDT
Yessir

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:10pm EDT
thought so

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:10pm EDT
I heard they suck

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:10pm EDT
I've been doing fine on homework and everything

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:10pm EDT
But this test

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:10pm EDT
This is what I've been trying to do

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:10pm EDT
For the last Really long time

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:11pm EDT
haha funny

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:12pm EDT
I was teaching geometry

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:12pm EDT
then all the sudden I saw sin and cos

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:12pm EDT
and just went

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:12pm EDT
...wtf are those?

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:12pm EDT
then told the class that they already learned that stuff so just do it on your own

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:12pm EDT
Hahahaha

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:12pm EDT
Good teacher

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:13pm EDT
Ruzga retaught it to me inbetween periods

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:13pm EDT
freakin SohCahToa

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:13pm EDT
always was horrible at trig

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:14pm EDT
Poor Nicholas

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:14pm EDT
I feel like all I've been doing this year is trig

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:14pm EDT
are you solving for x in that equation?

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:14pm EDT
No

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:15pm EDT
You need to make one side equal the other

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:15pm EDT
So the sin cubed blahblah needs to eventually be simplified to what's on the right

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:15pm EDT
Or Vice Versa

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:15pm EDT
I won't waste your time trying to get you to teach me your test

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:15pm EDT
x is just representative of the angle. It could be theta or y or anything really

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:16pm EDT
because I have only the slightest idea of what you mean

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:16pm EDT
Yeah unfortunately None of my friends are capable of helpin me

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:16pm EDT
I miss being math smart :'(

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:16pm EDT
I talk about my stupid decision of not droppingTV21 for precalc

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:16pm EDT
in my Spanish essay

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:17pm EDT
Poor Nicholas lol Spanish

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 8:18pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 9:13pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 9:14pm EDT
I don't like being rushed

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 9:15pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 9:15pm EDT
it's awful right

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 9:15pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 9:15pm EDT
this is barely a serious project

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 9:15pm EDT
and I keep having to use stupid ideas

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 9:15pm EDT
becauseI dont have time to think of good ones

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 9:16pm EDT
whats the project on

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 9:24pm EDT
I am drawing the 4 seasons

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 9:24pm EDT
using spades as symbols

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 9:24pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 9:24pm EDT
I have summer

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 9:25pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 9:25pm EDT
possibly graphite

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 9:25pm EDT
spring will be flowers with paint I think

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 9:25pm EDT
I really chose a horrible idea for this project

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:44pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:47pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:47pm EDT
I was being facetious

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:48pm EDT
That was just my first reaction idk Well I wasn't under the assumption that you carry hundreds of live dragons Although I was referring to a real dragon when I said I wish I had one

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:49pm EDT
I always am

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:49pm EDT
depends what kind

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:49pm EDT
I would love one of the dragons from the Fire within series

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:50pm EDT
They are little ceramic dragons that come alive when no one is around but the people that live in the home

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:50pm EDT
And they all have little talents

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:50pm EDT
depending on what they are

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:51pm EDT
Like there are fixing dragons and healing dragons, etc

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:51pm EDT
there are even art and writing dragons

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:51pm EDT
and they hold little hammers or paint brushes or bandaids

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:51pm EDT
that'd be sweet

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:51pm EDT
O:

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:51pm EDT
That's awesome

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:51pm EDT
I know!

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:52pm EDT
Oh

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:53pm EDT
What's my favorite book

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:53pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:53pm EDT
you've probly told me before

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:53pm EDT
I'm guessing it's not harry potter

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:53pm EDT
No like I don't know what my favorite book is

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:54pm EDT
This isn't a test It's just cause then that'd be another thing to put in

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:54pm EDT
list books you'd read right now if you had the chance

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:56pm EDT
Books ive read or havent? Cause i mean Uh the books you and Kevin gave me The list of John green books I've never gotten to. Btw I'm reading looking for Alaska for my independent study Um What's it called Demon King? Some shit like that. By cinda Williams china. There's part of it at the end of the dragon heir I believe Others Maybe I'll put the wizard heir in there

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:56pm EDT
books you have read

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:56pm EDT
You should've said that

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:56pm EDT
thats a fun study

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:56pm EDT
i wanted to see the list

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:57pm EDT
If I were to read any book right now it wouldn't be one I've read cause there's too many I want to read

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:57pm EDT
well my theory is, if you'd read the book again, it must be a good book

Steph DudakThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:58pm EDT
I think I read the wizard heir twice anyway since I accidentally started with that one. I like that trilogy so I might as well throw it in there. Besides its not like I need to talk about the book

Nick DevlinThursday, May 17, 2012 at 11:59pm EDT
they should be in there on their covers alone

Steph DudakFriday, May 18, 2012 at 12:00am EDT
That's why I picked the book up lol

Nick DevlinFriday, May 18, 2012 at 12:00am EDT
what's this for?

Steph DudakFriday, May 18, 2012 at 12:00am EDT
That book proved that I can sometimes judge a book by its cover and get away with it

Steph DudakFriday, May 18, 2012 at 12:00am EDT
My bag of me project

Nick DevlinFriday, May 18, 2012 at 12:00am EDT

Steph DudakMonday, May 21, 2012 at 6:45pm EDT
i will never find a job

Steph DudakMonday, May 21, 2012 at 6:45pm EDT
the fact that i need to find a job for this project that i can get right after i graduate that is relevant to what i majored in right now and i have no idea what i'm doing dumbest project

Steph DudakMonday, May 21, 2012 at 6:46pm EDT
http://architect.thingamajob.com/jobs/Utah/Architectural-Designer/2560193 found this thing though and i'm using it

Nick DevlinMonday, May 21, 2012 at 7:36pm EDT
yeah I always see architecture and graphic design at the top 10 of "harderest fields to get a job in"

Steph DudakMonday, May 21, 2012 at 7:37pm EDT
top 10 "do not get a job in this field" "you suck stop trying to get a job in architecture" "why would you major in this" "it is not at all lucrative" etc

Nick DevlinMonday, May 21, 2012 at 7:37pm EDT
yes

Steph DudakMonday, May 21, 2012 at 7:37pm EDT
"everything lies to you"

Nick DevlinMonday, May 21, 2012 at 7:37pm EDT
That's why I quit my major

Nick DevlinMonday, May 21, 2012 at 7:37pm EDT

Nick DevlinMonday, May 21, 2012 at 7:37pm EDT

Nick DevlinMonday, May 21, 2012 at 7:39pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, May 21, 2012 at 7:40pm EDT

Nick DevlinMonday, May 21, 2012 at 7:43pm EDT
the first year or so is just the irrelevant to your major classes anyway

Nick DevlinMonday, May 21, 2012 at 7:43pm EDT

so much fun

Steph DudakMonday, May 21, 2012 at 7:58pm EDT
hah

Steph DudakMonday, May 21, 2012 at 7:58pm EDT
imagine if

Steph DudakMonday, May 21, 2012 at 7:58pm EDT
someone had metal plates in them

Steph DudakMonday, May 21, 2012 at 7:58pm EDT
and you accidentally bended them without knowing

Steph DudakMonday, May 21, 2012 at 7:58pm EDT
that'd be awful

Nick DevlinMonday, May 21, 2012 at 7:58pm EDT
that's horrifying

Nick DevlinMonday, May 21, 2012 at 7:59pm EDT
i wonder how you you would bend earth in someone?

Nick DevlinMonday, May 21, 2012 at 7:59pm EDT
people breathe air

Nick DevlinMonday, May 21, 2012 at 7:59pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, May 21, 2012 at 8:01pm EDT
blood bending you know

Steph DudakMonday, May 21, 2012 at 8:02pm EDT
no earth or metal bending would work in a person i don't think unless they had actual metal chunks in them somewhere

Nick DevlinMonday, May 21, 2012 at 8:20pm EDT
i think my facebook app broke

Nick DevlinMonday, May 21, 2012 at 8:20pm EDT
here's what i wrote before

Nick DevlinMonday, May 21, 2012 at 8:20pm EDT
I got it bend earth and cover the person in an earth exoskeleton then bend that erth I still don't get why earth benders never use their full power they literally just hand to make cages of earth around people, or bury them to their waist

Steph DudakMonday, May 21, 2012 at 8:21pm EDT
cause that

Steph DudakMonday, May 21, 2012 at 8:21pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, May 26, 2012 at 11:41am EDT
Nick is known for his magnificent fame throughout the nation. He also has the power to rocket instantly, however only in winter. Nick has mastered the ability to change shape into a werewolf, but he must speak words of power to do so. Additionally, he has learned to sculpt and mold all corbomite with a thought and he has the power to cause his antagonists to become diseased. Nick has been known to transform any dog into fluid, but never during a new moon. He can create mental energy out of thin air. Terribly, Nick is notorious for being horribly disfigured. Nick is notorious for being horribly disfigured…

Nick DevlinMonday, May 28, 2012 at 9:49pm EDT

Nick DevlinMonday, May 28, 2012 at 10:08pm EDT

Nick DevlinMonday, May 28, 2012 at 10:09pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, May 28, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
what's my greatest weakness

Steph DudakMonday, May 28, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
and strength

Steph DudakMonday, May 28, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
sorry to change the subject

Nick DevlinMonday, May 28, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
hmmm

Nick DevlinMonday, May 28, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
weakness, maybe your temper

Nick DevlinMonday, May 28, 2012 at 10:10pm EDT
that's be my bet

Steph DudakMonday, May 28, 2012 at 10:11pm EDT
you'd win that bet

Nick DevlinMonday, May 28, 2012 at 10:11pm EDT
especially your temper around josh or doug

Nick DevlinMonday, May 28, 2012 at 10:11pm EDT
then strength would be either dedication to work, or loyalty to a project etc.

Nick DevlinMonday, May 28, 2012 at 10:12pm EDT
but meh, you tend to overdo that, if it's not perfect you throw it away

Steph DudakMonday, May 28, 2012 at 10:12pm EDT
weakness and strength: attention to detail

Steph DudakMonday, May 28, 2012 at 10:12pm EDT
WOMP

Nick DevlinMonday, May 28, 2012 at 10:12pm EDT
very much so

Nick DevlinMonday, May 28, 2012 at 10:13pm EDT
yeah

Steph DudakMonday, May 28, 2012 at 10:14pm EDT
meh

Nick DevlinMonday, May 28, 2012 at 10:15pm EDT
greatest strengths are hard to think of

Steph DudakMonday, May 28, 2012 at 10:15pm EDT
especially when most of the strengths i think of double as weaknesses lol

Nick DevlinMonday, May 28, 2012 at 10:15pm EDT
all of my strengths are weaknesses

Nick DevlinMonday, May 28, 2012 at 10:18pm EDT
and hmm, I really can't think of standout strengths in you

Steph DudakMonday, May 28, 2012 at 10:19pm EDT
wallwalalalwalala okie

Nick DevlinMonday, May 28, 2012 at 10:20pm EDT
stuff like your smart at math, you work hard, you stand up for yourself. It's all just good things

Nick DevlinMonday, May 28, 2012 at 10:20pm EDT
no real greatest strength

Steph DudakMonday, May 28, 2012 at 10:21pm EDT
i don't need to answer the question completely seriously, it's just a tumblr ask lol but i need to answer all the dumb even numbers

Nick DevlinMonday, May 28, 2012 at 10:22pm EDT
