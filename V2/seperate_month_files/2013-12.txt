Steph DudakSaturday, December 1, 2012 at 5:58pm EST
oh

Nick DevlinSaturday, December 1, 2012 at 5:58pm EST
its really easy and I'm scared I'm doing the wrong work

Steph DudakSaturday, December 1, 2012 at 5:59pm EST
ooooooooooooooooooooh

Nick DevlinSaturday, December 1, 2012 at 5:59pm EST
we're just doing linits again

Nick DevlinSaturday, December 1, 2012 at 6:00pm EST
but they added limits to it

Nick DevlinSaturday, December 1, 2012 at 6:00pm EST
infinity*

Nick DevlinSaturday, December 1, 2012 at 6:24pm EST
quick question, idk if you'd know

Nick DevlinSaturday, December 1, 2012 at 6:25pm EST
the limit of 1/infinity is 0, does that mean the limit of 10/infinity is also 0?

Nick DevlinSaturday, December 1, 2012 at 6:32pm EST
figured it out

Nick DevlinSaturday, December 1, 2012 at 6:32pm EST
sorry for the random question

Steph DudakSaturday, December 1, 2012 at 6:32pm EST
sorrry i had to go down to studio

Steph DudakSaturday, December 1, 2012 at 6:32pm EST
blame rich for lack of response

Steph DudakSaturday, December 1, 2012 at 6:32pm EST

Nick DevlinSaturday, December 1, 2012 at 6:39pm EST
define 'ratchet'

Nick DevlinSaturday, December 1, 2012 at 6:39pm EST
or whatever that word steph says

Steph DudakSaturday, December 1, 2012 at 6:39pm EST
ratchet(adj) - shitty looking thing

Nick DevlinSaturday, December 1, 2012 at 6:40pm EST
thank you

Steph DudakSaturday, December 1, 2012 at 6:40pm EST
"That thing looks ratchet as hell!"

Steph DudakSaturday, December 1, 2012 at 6:40pm EST
"That ghetto ass nigga is ratchet as fuck."

Nick DevlinSaturday, December 1, 2012 at 6:41pm EST
just wanted to check

Steph DudakSaturday, December 1, 2012 at 6:42pm EST
yeah she says it all the time now

Nick DevlinSaturday, December 1, 2012 at 6:42pm EST
i know

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 5:57pm EST
STEPH THANK YOU

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 5:57pm EST
Rich just dropped off da wood

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 5:57pm EST
no problem! let me know how it goes, hope the two 1/8 planks are enough

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 5:58pm EST
more than enough, all my pieces i am cutting out fit on the one board

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 5:58pm EST
i can cut the 3/16 with an xacto knife right?

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 5:58pm EST
or should i use a box cutter or something

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 6:00pm EST
you can but itd be difficult. youll have to go through it a bunch of times and be careful of the wood splitting etc

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 6:05pm EST
yeah i thought so

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 6:05pm EST
going over it 400 times would be better than sawing to me though

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 6:10pm EST
whatever works for you

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 6:10pm EST
i just wanted to check that it was a feasible option

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 6:11pm EST
oh yeah ive done it like i said you just need to be really careful

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 6:12pm EST
any advice?

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 6:14pm EST
just make sure youre cutting up against something straight that the xacto knife cant cut into also something that wont slide against the wood and just go over whatever line you draw as straight as possible

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 6:16pm EST
awesome

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 6:16pm EST
thanks

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 6:16pm EST
going caroling now -.-

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 6:16pm EST
lol have fun!

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
they never told me id be caroling in front of a crowd at town hall

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
LOL WHAT

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 8:56pm EST
yeahhh

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 8:56pm EST
twas awkward

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:03pm EST
this stuff you gave me is amazing

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:04pm EST
glad it's working out for you! what's even more awesome is staining it. i know you're covering it with fabric and whatever but idk staining wood is just fun to me lol

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:05pm EST
I almost want to leave it like this and stain it

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:05pm EST
but i'll save that for another day

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
itd look awesome either way a nice reddish stain

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
sedona red is nice, i used that on my last model. i have this red mahogany stain marker which is like a really dark brown but it has a very slight red tint to it and i actually like it now more than i did when i tested it a few days ago

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
thats awesome

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
would be a nice floor color

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:07pm EST
I just wand to buy a ton of this stuff

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:07pm EST
it cuts so nicely

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:07pm EST
and no dust

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:08pm EST
you can do so much with it too if you ever make a trek to utrecht they have even bigger sheets of that stuff. that's like 6" wide instead of 4, squarer sheets it's cool. i'm not really sure how expensive it is, despite me buying it all the time. i just know i have to get it so i just buy it. but it doesnt really break the bank and it's worth it

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:09pm EST
about 35 bucks

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:09pm EST
i hcecked when you told me about it

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:09pm EST
for how much?

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:10pm EST
some sheets

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:10pm EST
pretty big not sure how big

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:12pm EST
i have receipts on receipts idk why ididnt check them lol. the 4x24 ones are like 1.78 and up depending on thickness

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:12pm EST
thats really cheap

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:13pm EST
also

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:13pm EST
if you go to utrecht and youre a student

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:13pm EST
you can get like a student card thingy

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:13pm EST
like for other stores that you can put on your keychain i got one last time i went there cause free and i got like 10% off my purchase

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:13pm EST
so cool

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:14pm EST
ughh the grain doesnt even matter

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:15pm EST
i cut it in every direction

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:15pm EST
omg its so great cutting with the grain though its so smooth haha

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:15pm EST
i know against the grain is amazing

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:16pm EST
but with the grain idk which side was even the part i cut

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:17pm EST
your box is gonna come out awesome, i expect to see when it's done!

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:17pm EST
of course!

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:17pm EST
I will document the process I think

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:18pm EST
just to show sara all the work i did!!

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:18pm EST
yeeees progression pictures she's gonna love it

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:19pm EST
i only have a wek to do it

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:19pm EST
and all my school worjk

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:19pm EST
is this what art school feels like

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:20pm EST
yes but on a much bigger scale and then add drawings of the object, drafted, on mylar, with different line weights

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:21pm EST
only thing is other classes dont matter as much as design

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:22pm EST
and are more or less smooth sailing

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:23pm EST
ALSO make life easy for yourself if youre xacto knife cutting all that, change your blade fairly often

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:24pm EST
funfun

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:24pm EST
and how do i miter

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:26pm EST
welll are you doing it by hand?

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:26pm EST
mhmm

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:27pm EST
do you have any way of getting to a machine that does that? a table saw, a sander,

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:27pm EST
do you think the wood shop at intermediate east would have anything like that?

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:27pm EST
i have a sander

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:28pm EST
like one of theose vibraty things you put a piece of sandpaper on right?

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:29pm EST
i suppose lol i dont have anything like that i mean like in the shop here they have big machines, theyre circular and theyre plugged in. you turn them on and they spin and when you put a thing up against it it sands away. they have a 45 degree one too

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:29pm EST
which you can also use to miter

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:29pm EST
yeah i dont have any big machines

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:29pm EST
i guess all youd do is put a corner up against it

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:29pm EST
and then sand it to the other corner til its at that angle

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:30pm EST
well i mean idk what it is you have lol

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:31pm EST
its basically a faster way to sand by hand

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:31pm EST
you hold it against what you are sanding and it just grinds away

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:32pm EST
so basically same thing you can try that

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:32pm EST
i shall

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:32pm EST
on a test piece

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:32pm EST
god idea

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:32pm EST
describes me pretty well

Steph DudakSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:32pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, December 2, 2012 at 9:38pm EST

Nick DevlinTuesday, December 4, 2012 at 9:49am EST
my mom hasnt been able to drive me anywhere the past week, nor will she be able to until I leave, thats one of the reasons I havent been able to go anywhere to get stuff

Nick DevlinTuesday, December 4, 2012 at 9:50am EST
plus i dont even know anyone at int east. so i have no clue who to ask

Nick DevlinTuesday, December 4, 2012 at 10:41pm EST
Nick DevlinTuesday, December 4, 2012 at 10:42pm EST
It doesn't suck!!!

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 5, 2012 at 10:59am EST
math is hard

Steph DudakWednesday, December 5, 2012 at 10:59am EST
i'm sorry

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 5, 2012 at 11:00am EST
but its still funish

Nick DevlinWednesday, December 5, 2012 at 11:00am EST
so its all good

but the highlited blue name is snoop dogs answers

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 12:26am EST
I poseted in movie group all the pictureof my box process

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 12:26am EST
you light thing

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 12:26am EST
is amazing

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 12:26am EST
it looks so cool

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 12:35am EST
i just looked through it I AM YOUR BEST FRIEND :D IT CAME OUT SO GOOD IM SO PROUD OF YOU! & thank you so much :D it's actualy pretty ratchet because it didn't fit together perfectly but i'm starting to like it ore

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 12:36am EST
more *

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 12:36am EST
:D

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 12:36am EST
i like the stain you ised

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 12:37am EST
it's actually much darker in person! but it looks really nice with the mylar. im probably gonna bring it home with me to show people so you can see it in person

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 12:37am EST
hang it up! it'd look so cool

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 12:37am EST
it's not supposed to hang homie!

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 12:37am EST
or like as a thing for nightstand

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 12:38am EST
it is an object so you can put it on a table, nightstand, bookshelf. so you can pick it up and move it around and such

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 12:38am EST
i didnt want strings or wires

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 12:38am EST
gotch

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 12:38am EST
ruins the geometry

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 12:38am EST
gotcha*

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 12:38am EST
but imagine like 40 of them hanging in an openish room

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 12:39am EST
at different levels

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 12:39am EST
oh that'd look sweet

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 12:39am EST
and if they slowly rotate

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 12:39am EST
that would be awesome

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 12:40am EST
i kind of want to make another one of these

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 12:40am EST
but id need to figure a better way to light it

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 12:40am EST
fun

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 12:40am EST
I just wanted to congradulate you on your project and show off my

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
I DONT REMEMBER MATH AND DONT HAVE MY NOTES WITH ME

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
I figured

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
nope

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:13pm EST
need some weird log in or sometih\

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:13pm EST
oh true okay

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:13pm EST
Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:13pm EST
how bout that

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:14pm EST
it opens

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:14pm EST
ooh fancy

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:14pm EST
limits

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:14pm EST
WONDERFUL

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:14pm EST
yes

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:14pm EST
forget

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:14pm EST
do i plug in 0

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
yep

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
and then get 0/0 which dne so right and left hand i remember

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
adding and subtracting .01 is that from 0?

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
and then plug into eq?

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
nah that's too much work

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
you fuck around with the equation till you can plug in zero and get a real number

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
...

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
so for the first

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:16pm EST
first you factor

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:16pm EST
try to simply that way

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:16pm EST
see if it become a real number

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:17pm EST
you get x/(x(x-3))

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:17pm EST
x's cancel out

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:17pm EST
1/x-3

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:17pm EST
plug in zero

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:17pm EST
bam

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:17pm EST
-1/3

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:19pm EST
of course i'm probly wrong

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:19pm EST
I'll double check just to make sure

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:20pm EST
ooooo

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:20pm EST
one sec

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:20pm EST
np

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:21pm EST
yes!

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:21pm EST
alright so now vertical asymptotes

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:21pm EST
x = 3

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:22pm EST
mhmm

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:22pm EST
now values for f where f(x) is continuous

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:22pm EST
dont remember either

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:22pm EST
thats just the domain

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:22pm EST
find all the holes and asymptotes

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:23pm EST
so where ever the function is undefined, or DNE

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:23pm EST
so basically set the denominator to 0

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:23pm EST
find all possible values for x

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:24pm EST
which is 3, and 0

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:24pm EST
thats all I can find

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:24pm EST
when x doesnt equal 0 and doesnt equal 3

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:24pm EST
so idk how your teacher wants it

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:24pm EST
f(x) is continuous if x ? 0, x ? 3

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:24pm EST
its that same thing

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
you need to do that

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
its continuous at not those points

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
mine likes (negative infinity, 0), (0,3),(3, infinity

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
oh yeah

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
set builder notation or whatever that junk is

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
fuckin

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
theres another one

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
interval

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
notation

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
I never learned it

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
wong gives no fuck

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
either actually

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
thats what interval notation is

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
whatevs

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
what you sent me

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
awesome

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
makes sense

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:26pm EST
so basically you have a few tricks to find the limit when you get 0/0

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:26pm EST
factor

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:26pm EST
conjugate

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:26pm EST
trig identities

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:27pm EST
theres some more i think

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:28pm EST
word

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:28pm EST
yeah

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:28pm EST
basically just fuck around with the equation

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:29pm EST
ooh finding derivative

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:29pm EST
doin that nao

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:30pm EST
tell me if ya get stuck

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:30pm EST
Just finished all that derivative shtuff

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:31pm EST
do you add or subtract one from exponents when youre doing derivatives omg

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:32pm EST
...

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:32pm EST
damn

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:32pm EST
:P

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:32pm EST
x^3

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:32pm EST
3x^2

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:32pm EST
subtract thought so

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:32pm EST
remember to multiply the number to the coefficient

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:32pm EST
yep!

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:33pm EST
did you ever solve that stuff the long way

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:33pm EST
my god

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:33pm EST
its horrifying

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:33pm EST
to solve for derivative using limits

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:33pm EST
like 2 pages

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:34pm EST
i dont think so im not sure

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:34pm EST
got this one right

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:36pm EST
which?

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:36pm EST
just the number i'll solve and see if you are right

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:37pm EST
oh jk

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:37pm EST
you got it right

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:37pm EST
i tought you said you werent sure

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:37pm EST
good job then!

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:41pm EST
but the next question i always mess up on logs

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:41pm EST
i know its gonna be 2x

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:41pm EST
logs are awesome now

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:41pm EST
cause the x^2

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:41pm EST
but the ln8x how

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:42pm EST
did you learn product and chain rule?

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:42pm EST
omg dumb

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:42pm EST
funfun

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:45pm EST
alright

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:45pm EST
wait

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:45pm EST
so chain rule

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:45pm EST
mhmm

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:45pm EST
ln8x 1. u= 8x 2. f(u)= lnu 3. u'=8 4. f'(u)=1/u * u'

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:46pm EST
mhmm

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:46pm EST
it seems so complicated when written that way

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:46pm EST
but yes

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:46pm EST
1/8x * 8

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:46pm EST
yes

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:46pm EST
8/8x = 1/x ..

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:46pm EST
yes

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:47pm EST
and then

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:48pm EST
...

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:49pm EST
3)	f'(x) = 2x ln 8x + x this is the answer

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:49pm EST
thats what i got

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:49pm EST
what do i do after i get 1/x

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:49pm EST
what did i just do

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:50pm EST
f(x)=x^2

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:50pm EST
g(x)=ln(8x)

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:50pm EST
product rule

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:50pm EST
f'(x)g(x)+f(x)g'(x)

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:50pm EST
OMG

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:51pm EST
DUMB

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:51pm EST
OKAY

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:51pm EST
GOT IT THANKS

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:51pm EST
:)

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:51pm EST
chain rule is only for things inside other function

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:51pm EST
so you use both in this problem

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:51pm EST
i just for some reason did not understand that you could do product rule like it wasnt a thing in my head idk THANK YOU

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:53pm EST
np

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:56pm EST
have you done integrals yet

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:56pm EST
yup

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:57pm EST
numero 6

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:58pm EST
x

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:58pm EST
x^2/2

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:58pm EST
3x^2

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:58pm EST
wait

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:58pm EST
what are you doing

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:59pm EST
2x^3 - 9x^-2 find integral

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:59pm EST
i am trying to give example then explain

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:59pm EST
x becomes

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:59pm EST
x^2/2

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:59pm EST
add one to exponent

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:59pm EST
and exponent underneath

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:59pm EST
divide by that new exponent

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:59pm EST
yeah

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 7:59pm EST
2x4/4 ???

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:01pm EST
umm

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:01pm EST
yes

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:01pm EST
then

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:01pm EST
thats what i got

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:01pm EST
x^4/2

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:01pm EST
yup

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:04pm EST
alright part b

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:04pm EST
cause i got the integral fora x^4/2 + 9/x + C

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:05pm EST
dont i have to like

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:05pm EST
shouldnt it be

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:05pm EST
nevermind

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:05pm EST
that integral is right i checked

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:06pm EST
yes it is

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:06pm EST
i minues somewhere

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:06pm EST
i dont know what you mean by that

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:06pm EST
i need help with part b tho

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:06pm EST
no prob

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:07pm EST
I made an error with negatives

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:07pm EST
that was my problem

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:07pm EST
you know the integral formula thingy right?

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:07pm EST
what do you meeeeeeean

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:07pm EST
b^(n+1)/(n+1)-a(n+1)/(n+1)

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:07pm EST
what

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
basically you subtract

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
sorry havent spent that long on integrals

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
and have no notes with me to see examples

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
i know theyre easy

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
put the bigger number into the problem

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
i thought i have to plug in 1

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
you plug in both

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
do i plug it into the original equation

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
or do i need to use the integral from the first

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
and plug them into that

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
use the integral

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
so integral of 3 MINUS integral of 1

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:10pm EST
cause dumb math teacher

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:10pm EST
i looked up the real formulas cause I had no clue how to explain

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:10pm EST
I didnt know them either

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:10pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:14pm EST
true

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:14pm EST
alright so how do i got about 7 sorry im askin all these questions i just need to make sure i can do all this

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:16pm EST
no prob

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:16pm EST
basically you gotta sorta use the chain rule

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:17pm EST
okay how

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:17pm EST
-x^8+4

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:17pm EST
here watch this, its too much for me too explain

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:17pm EST

http://patrickjmt.com/antiderivatives-integration-using-u-substitution/

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:18pm EST
watch from around 0:27

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:18pm EST
It's only about 2 minutes

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:18pm EST
the part you want at least

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:18pm EST
and the part you mentioned is what you want for u

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:22pm EST
okay but when i do that i get -8x^7 dx for du

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:23pm EST
i'm pretty sure the dx just goes away or something, I'm not entirely sure

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:24pm EST
dx= du/-8x^7

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:24pm EST
ive done something like thatbefore in a problem

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:24pm EST
it doesnt just disappear unless its exactly whats already in the problem

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:24pm EST
the only part thats in there is the x^7

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:24pm EST
hmm

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:24pm EST
not the -8

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:25pm EST
he does another problem after the sin/cos one

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:25pm EST
that might have what your looking for

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:25pm EST
idk

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:25pm EST

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:26pm EST
I've only done a week or so of this

Steph DudakMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:28pm EST

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:29pm EST
i will look over again

Nick DevlinMonday, December 10, 2012 at 8:30pm EST

Nick DevlinFriday, December 14, 2012 at 3:58pm EST
disappointed

Nick DevlinFriday, December 14, 2012 at 3:59pm EST
you can do better than that

Nick DevlinFriday, December 14, 2012 at 3:59pm EST
i expect a 105 at least

Steph DudakFriday, December 14, 2012 at 4:14pm EST
Yeah I know I'm so bad I wonder what those two points were for though Also C+ in drawing cause Morna hates me

Nick DevlinFriday, December 14, 2012 at 4:14pm EST
:/

Nick DevlinFriday, December 14, 2012 at 4:14pm EST
whatver

Nick DevlinFriday, December 14, 2012 at 4:15pm EST
do you know why?

Steph DudakFriday, December 14, 2012 at 4:16pm EST
No like actual reason I think she just doesn't like me/my work

Steph DudakFriday, December 14, 2012 at 4:16pm EST
Because

Steph DudakFriday, December 14, 2012 at 4:17pm EST
Sean's missed 6 or 7 classes, missed a few assignments im sure and he got a B. a solid B. he had a D by midterms. Love him but makes no sense. I missed three classes and I only didn't hand in one assignment and didn't finish one

Nick DevlinFriday, December 14, 2012 at 4:18pm EST
that would infuriate me, or i'd probly just not give a shit

Nick DevlinFriday, December 14, 2012 at 4:18pm EST
depends how much work i put into it

Steph DudakFriday, December 14, 2012 at 4:21pm EST
It's frustrating because even though I hated her and her class I did try

Nick DevlinFriday, December 14, 2012 at 4:21pm EST
thats what would make me mad too

Nick DevlinFriday, December 14, 2012 at 4:22pm EST
well hopefully you'll never have her again

Steph DudakFriday, December 14, 2012 at 4:22pm EST
If I get her for any class for any reason I am immediately getting out of it Idc what it takes

Steph DudakFriday, December 14, 2012 at 4:22pm EST
If I have to take an 8am instead that's what'll happen

Steph DudakFriday, December 14, 2012 at 4:22pm EST
I know I won't have her next semester

Nick DevlinFriday, December 14, 2012 at 4:23pm EST
good

Steph DudakFriday, December 14, 2012 at 4:23pm EST
Pretty sure she's not teaching technics of communication which is my drawing class

Steph DudakFriday, December 14, 2012 at 4:23pm EST
If she is then BYE switching to Betty's 8:30

Nick DevlinFriday, December 14, 2012 at 4:23pm EST
they dont tell you the teacher?

Steph DudakFriday, December 14, 2012 at 4:27pm EST

not all of it, just firs tparagraph and last

Steph DudakSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:06pm EST
surely

Nick DevlinSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:06pm EST
The term “aquaponics” is a portmanteau of the words hydroponics and aquaculture, methods of farming plants and fish respectively. To understand aquaponics and all of its benefits fully, it is important to understand the two methods of farming from which it is derived. The basic system of aquaponics is that a cycle of nitrogen is created between fish, plants and bacteria, allowing them to support each other. The fish are bred in pools of water. The water becomes heavily laden with nutrients and chemicals, so much so that the water would be toxic, if the bacteria did not convert the ammonia given off by the fish into nitrites, then into nitrates. The nitrate filled water is then pumped into the plants water supply. The plants filter out all of the chemicals leaving them clean enough for the fish to live in (Diver). To fully understand how beneficial this system it will be compared to both of the systems it is based off of.

To fully understand how beneficial this system it will be compared to both of the systems it is based off of. should there be an is between beneficial this system it

Steph DudakSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:08pm EST
otherwise i think that is a wonderful paragraph

Nick DevlinSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:09pm EST
awesome

Nick DevlinSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:09pm EST
oops

Nick DevlinSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:09pm EST
wrote the same sentence twice :/

Steph DudakSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:10pm EST
you basically said that in the beginning

Nick DevlinSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:10pm EST
yep i just didnt realize it

Steph DudakSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:10pm EST
i didn't either til just now lol i'm getting worse at paper writing and analyzing i apologize

Steph DudakSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:11pm EST
my writing teacher this semester didn't do much for me, nor did mrs morgan senior year so i mean i'm just. what are papers

Nick DevlinSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:11pm EST
I just want to make sure the sentences are legible sentences

Steph DudakSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:11pm EST
oh yes they are

Steph DudakSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:12pm EST
i think especially with the way you write sometimes you can't really tell if you've repeated yourself

Nick DevlinSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:12pm EST
sometimes I get too into what I'm writing and it makes it impossible for others to understand

Steph DudakSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:12pm EST
and if you do they sound like slightly different ideas

Nick DevlinSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:12pm EST
that too

Steph DudakSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:12pm EST
but in a way that it sounds okay

Steph DudakSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:12pm EST
and not that you're looking for more to write

Nick DevlinSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:12pm EST
I am reiterating in order to emphasize the point

Nick DevlinSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:12pm EST
yeahhh

Steph DudakSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:13pm EST
i just mean in general it sounds good and i don't find it confusing so

Nick DevlinSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:14pm EST
thats all i'm looking for

Nick DevlinSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:15pm EST
I really don't feel like putting much into this essay, I just want a passing grade, so I like deleted half of my points

Nick DevlinSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:15pm EST
I have no quotes or stats either

Nick DevlinSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:15pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:16pm EST
except on the occasional project

Steph DudakSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:17pm EST
i don't think i've heard you say "i don't feel like putting much into this . . . i just want a passing grade" except maybe in your math class that you didn't have completed any real prerequisite for and if you have i am bad at paying attention or you havent said it to me

Steph DudakSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:17pm EST
i'll go with the latter

Nick DevlinSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:18pm EST
hmmm

Nick DevlinSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:18pm EST
I tend not to say 'i just want a passing grade'

Nick DevlinSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:19pm EST
usually my 'i'm not is enough to get me an a or b putting much into this'

Nick DevlinSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:19pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:24pm EST
i was going to ask you if you were aware of the quality of a pair of like slip on airwalks like http://www.payless.com/store/product/detail.jsp?catId=cat10089&subCatId=cat10295&skuId=096899105&productId=60504&lotId=096899&category=&catdisplayName=Mens but you dont buy shoes very often do you

Nick DevlinSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:24pm EST
the only brand of shoe i've bought in the past 6 years

Nick DevlinSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:24pm EST
is airwalks

Nick DevlinSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:25pm EST
their comfortable last about 8 months of constant daily use before thei start to erode

Nick DevlinSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:25pm EST
theyre

Nick DevlinSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:25pm EST
*

Steph DudakSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:26pm EST
well what are the odds! do you think that applies to all kinds of shoes of that brand then? at least sneaker wise~

Steph DudakSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:26pm EST
as long as they last for a while

Nick DevlinSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:27pm EST
I'd suppose so, I'd assume if they remained consistent for 5 years, they'd remain consistent in other forms of the shoe

Steph DudakSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:28pm EST
excellent

Nick DevlinSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:31pm EST
arent you lucky

Nick DevlinSunday, December 16, 2012 at 6:45pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, December 16, 2012 at 8:16pm EST
imma be with him all day tomorrow, i'm assuming he won't be wearing shoes at some point because he doesn't even really like wearing shoes that much, and i'm sure at one point he'll have to walk out of whatever place we're at so i will resort to that because i don't want to spend money on bowling, and i don't want him to spend money on bowling because he spends enough money on me

Nick DevlinTuesday, December 18, 2012 at 12:43pm EST
do that to our cookies

Nick DevlinTuesday, December 18, 2012 at 12:43pm EST
how

Nick DevlinTuesday, December 18, 2012 at 12:43pm EST
why?

Nick DevlinTuesday, December 18, 2012 at 12:43pm EST
what?

Steph DudakTuesday, December 18, 2012 at 12:43pm EST
hahaha

Steph DudakTuesday, December 18, 2012 at 12:44pm EST
how: photoshop why: because they weren't greenscreened what: greenscreen cookies

Nick DevlinTuesday, December 18, 2012 at 12:44pm EST
more in depth into how, thats perty cool

Steph DudakTuesday, December 18, 2012 at 12:45pm EST
selected the cookies with the magic wand tool, created a new layer and filled it with a rainbow gradient. then set the layer to i believe color

Nick DevlinTuesday, December 18, 2012 at 12:45pm EST
hmm

Nick DevlinTuesday, December 18, 2012 at 12:46pm EST
so that magic wand just automatically clicked only cookies?

Steph DudakTuesday, December 18, 2012 at 12:46pm EST
i clicked the cookies with it so it'd only select them

Steph DudakTuesday, December 18, 2012 at 12:46pm EST
that is the function of the magic wand tool, to select specific shapes

Nick DevlinTuesday, December 18, 2012 at 12:46pm EST
weird, thats really useful

Steph DudakTuesday, December 18, 2012 at 1:05pm EST
also need to think of what kind of website it is

Steph DudakTuesday, December 18, 2012 at 1:05pm EST
if it's set up like blog-style and you want people to be able to comment on things, get yourself php installed and cutenews

Steph DudakTuesday, December 18, 2012 at 1:06pm EST
that way all your pages are like .php

Steph DudakTuesday, December 18, 2012 at 1:06pm EST
you know

Nick DevlinTuesday, December 18, 2012 at 1:06pm EST
i understand what you are saying

Nick DevlinTuesday, December 18, 2012 at 1:06pm EST
but i don't know how to do any of these things

Steph DudakTuesday, December 18, 2012 at 1:07pm EST
i'm sure it's something that can be googled and then done cause i'm fairly certain i had to do it myself on my last ~website and that was when i was 13 so i'm pretty certain it's all easily done

Steph DudakTuesday, December 18, 2012 at 1:07pm EST
i just haven't done it in a while

Steph DudakTuesday, December 18, 2012 at 1:07pm EST

i'm sure there is a way to make the colors work though

Steph DudakFriday, December 21, 2012 at 11:11pm EST
im still trying to think if i wanna do normal captain falcon or pink captain falcon lol cause he plays "pink ranger" a lot.

Nick DevlinFriday, December 21, 2012 at 11:12pm EST
i like pink, but normal coloured might make him easier to distinguish

Nick DevlinFriday, December 21, 2012 at 11:12pm EST

Nick DevlinFriday, December 21, 2012 at 11:24pm EST

Steph DudakFriday, December 21, 2012 at 11:47pm EST

Steph DudakFriday, December 21, 2012 at 11:47pm EST
cause i need to include jigglypuff of course

Nick DevlinFriday, December 21, 2012 at 11:48pm EST
there's still the sides

Steph DudakFriday, December 21, 2012 at 11:48pm EST
i could do fox/falco, dr mario if i want to include other characters i also was debating

Steph DudakFriday, December 21, 2012 at 11:48pm EST
on throwing in

Steph DudakFriday, December 21, 2012 at 11:48pm EST
weapons

Steph DudakFriday, December 21, 2012 at 11:48pm EST

Nick DevlinFriday, December 21, 2012 at 11:49pm EST
you could use those colours in the back

Nick DevlinFriday, December 21, 2012 at 11:49pm EST
i believe it

Steph DudakFriday, December 21, 2012 at 11:50pm EST
he can be stepping off the cloud first of all cause richard always tries to land on that for protection and fails he he he
