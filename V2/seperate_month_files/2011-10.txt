Steph DudakSunday, October 2, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, October 2, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, October 2, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, October 2, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, October 2, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT
What impact will the Natural Disasters of 2010/11 have on the global economy? How should these events affect future political, business and personal decisions?

Steph DudakSunday, October 2, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, October 2, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
I am not really sure how to just write a normal essay

Nick DevlinSunday, October 2, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, October 2, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, October 2, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
do you know of any specific formats, besides like intro, body, end?

Nick DevlinSunday, October 2, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
do I repeat everything a quadrillion time like they always teach us?

Steph DudakSunday, October 2, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
that's basically a general format

Steph DudakSunday, October 2, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
no

Steph DudakSunday, October 2, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
don't repeat yourself a milllion times

Steph DudakSunday, October 2, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
unnecessary

Nick DevlinSunday, October 2, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
all right, that makes it easier

Nick DevlinSunday, October 2, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
and should i not use personaly pronouns

"I don't really find you all that funny. Ironic responses to things aren't really that humorous."

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 4, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
yeah krystin annoys me too now

Steph DudakTuesday, October 4, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT
-shakes head0

Steph DudakTuesday, October 4, 2011 at 10:41pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, October 4, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
ridiculous yo

Steph DudakTuesday, October 4, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
Wait when did she say that

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 4, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
Like 3 minutes before I sent it to you. I made some joke on one of posts about the correct usage of your/ you're

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 4, 2011 at 11:08pm EDT
Then when I responded she 'corrected' my spelling of the word humour

Steph DudakTuesday, October 4, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
She doesn't like the ~British spelling of words

Steph DudakTuesday, October 4, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
She gets real pissy about it

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 4, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
Good my reply included about 3 or 4 of then

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 4, 2011 at 11:16pm EDT
Why does she make trolling so easy, I think she wants me to instigate her

Steph DudakTuesday, October 4, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
Keep doing it lol. She basically asks for it.

Steph DudakTuesday, October 4, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT
I like when people can't tell if people are trolling, also. It makes things even better.

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 4, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
With me I usually try to make it as obvious as possible, which is why I find it weird when people think it's serious. But it can be amusing to watch people struggle to debate someone who is trolling

Steph DudakTuesday, October 4, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
Kids these days

Steph DudakTuesday, October 4, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
Just don't understand

Steph DudakTuesday, October 4, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
The fine art that is trolling

Nick DevlinMonday, October 10, 2011 at 10:03pm EDT
by letting the speakers go in order of how much their race has been descriminated in the past

Nick DevlinMonday, October 10, 2011 at 10:03pm EDT

would you write it like “Make the most of yourself, for that is all there is of you” (Ralph Waldo Emerson). oooooooooooooor

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:18pm EDT
orrr?

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:19pm EDT
oooooooooooor is that not how you do it

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:19pm EDT
what is the written thing?

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:19pm EDT
if that's how you are starting like an essay or something

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:19pm EDT
hmm

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:19pm EDT
depends

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:19pm EDT
research paper, no

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:20pm EDT
informal, no

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:20pm EDT
actually it doesn't depend

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:20pm EDT
its wrong either way :D

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:20pm EDT
well it could be improved at least

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:20pm EDT
if its just an essay for some random thing

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:20pm EDT
it'd be better to say

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:20pm EDT
can you just tell me

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:20pm EDT
how to write it

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:20pm EDT
omg

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:20pm EDT
Ralph Emerson once stated "blablablba"

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:20pm EDT
or some form of that

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:21pm EDT
if it s super research paper formal

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:21pm EDT
and you need citation

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:21pm EDT
kaaay

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:21pm EDT
then you have to cite better

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:21pm EDT
the way you have it kind of combine both

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:23pm EDT
are you doing it the first way i told you?

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:23pm EDT
or do you need it in citation form?

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:23pm EDT
i don't

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:23pm EDT
i'll just do it the other way thanks

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:24pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:28pm EDT
required?

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:28pm EDT
because previously it was optional?

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:29pm EDT
it wasn't really optional

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:29pm EDT
but it wasn't really required either

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:30pm EDT
now it is?

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:30pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT
since like freshman year

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
CRUSHED

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
like a spider.

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
because no one likes spiders

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
boris the spider

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
and no one likes my hopes and dreams

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
!!!!!

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
there was a giant orange spider outside my house once

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
that my dad named boris

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
have i told you that?

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
nope

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
please continue

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
well that's weird

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
since you just said boris the spider

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
do you know why it was named boris?

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
NO i don't know why nor did i really care at the time

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
does your dad like the who?

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
iiiii dunno

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:42pm EDT
i'll watch that in a bit

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:42pm EDT
how doyou say

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:42pm EDT
"You should consider me" without actually using those words..

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
don't use them at all

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
like lolol you should consider me as a member for nhs or somethin like that bc bksjdblkjklnjs

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
DUH

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
i have other hw to do still

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
the essay itself is a blatant "you should consider me"

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
yeah

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
but like, this is a closing thing

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
putting them in the paper is superfluous

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
i need like a

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
closer?

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
IM NOT SAYING

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
THE WORDS

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT
YOU SHOULD CONSIDER ME

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT
i'm SAYING, i need something that just relates to that, to close this up.

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT
you know what

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT
nevermind

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT
but even saying in other words, is just odd

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT
i'll figure it out myself.

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT
i can understand the need though

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT
that's not what i mean

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:44pm EDT
i get what you mean, i just need to type things that annoy you while i think

OKAY BUT REALLY

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:45pm EDT
skdgjrksjh

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:46pm EDT
try something like... "The best reasons for me to be in NHS blablablabla" or "the qualities that exemplify me blablbala"

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:47pm EDT
i can't think of a way to not make it sound so arrogant though

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:49pm EDT
yeah i know but you kind of have no choice lol. i threw in like a flaw or somethin when talking about how awesome i am and how punctual i am and blahblahblah. i dont really know how to close it though.. maybe with some weird little sentence followed by some bs like

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:49pm EDT
idk

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:50pm EDT
blahblahblah because i am a reliable and responsible person who has come to enjoy participating in school activities and can do what is expected of me. or something dumb like that. what is expected of me? obviously i can do that what. becoming a member of NHS will help me not only become even more involved in school (aside from classes) but enable me to put everything I have learned to additional use as well as help my peers and give back to my community.. lolol okkkkkkkkkk

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:50pm EDT
am i dumb or

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT
its sounds really trite, but I can't think of how it could possibly be written any other way

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT
exactly like akdjhglrh

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT
even the middle parts sound ridiculous

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
as far as school stuff goes i basically focused in on french club & peer leadership for a portion of it

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
like that's not what my whole essay is based off of

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
but that's like, displaying

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
OMG THATS THE WORD

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
displaying leadership and whatev

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT
you made sure to emphasize the large role you had in those organizations

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT
and completely ignore your lack of involvement in other areas right?

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT
no

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT
yes

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT
maybe

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT
yes

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT
lol

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT
but i wasnt specific

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT
so that kinda like

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT
what's the word

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT
starts with an i

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT
implied

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT
yes

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT
implies, that i'll be more active in like interact and stuff

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:57pm EDT
i feel like thats a pretty big accomplishment

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:57pm EDT
yeah you should mention that being involved hasn't affected your focus on school and blablabla

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:57pm EDT
yeees

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT

this is so long

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:03pm EDT
well not really. well its 528 words

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:03pm EDT
well its not like its the one of like 3 things you do

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:03pm EDT
Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, “Make the most of yourself, for that is all there is of you.” Much of our time in life is spent trying to find ourselves as people and trying to be the best we can be. Reflecting on this quote by Emerson, I have come to the realization that it is never too late to change, improve, and become more involved in what is happening around you. Part of finding yourself involves figuring out what you like doing and what makes you feel a sense of accomplishment. Another part is taking pride in your accomplishments and using that pride to more forward and continue doing what you do best. There are many things about myself, just like anyone else, that can be improved on. But there are also things about myself and things I have done that I take pride in. For example, I am a very punctual individual. I make it a priority to arrive where I need to be on time and to attend meetings that I am expected to attend. Being absent or late would be an aberration, which is also directly reflected in my high school records as I have perfect attendance. Aside from my punctuality, I am a trustworthy, honest person and am respectful to those around me. One of my downfalls, however, is that sometimes it takes me a while to actually become consistently involved in things. This is likely due to the fact that I am a naturally quiet person who listens and observes a lot more often. This is something I have been gradually working on and have been applying it to the clubs and activities that I participate in. I am capable of displaying leadership as shown in the clubs I am involved in and the community service I do outside of school. The more i enjoy something, the more likely I am to participate. This is particularly shown in my I have been a member of the French Club all of high school and became an active member during my sophomore year, doing things such as door decorating and the Trick-or-Treat at High School East for Halloween as well as helping to organize the Coffee Shop held every Spring, only to name a few. I came into my senior year with the intention of running for a position in office for French Club, however it was not possible for me to do so. Being involved has not had a negative affect on the focus I have on my school work. I have maintained honor roll Another one of my goals for this year is to continue being involved in the things I am now as well as become involved in new things. . . . because I am a reliable and responsible person who has come to enjoy participating in school activities and can do what is expected of me. Becoming a member of NHS will help me not only become even more involved in school (aside from classes) but enable me to put everything I have personally learned to additional use as well as help my peers and give back to my community.

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT
i changed the 4 from last year to a 3.

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT
ugh "for example"

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:04pm EDT
fun

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:06pm EDT
just as a general rule for these things is not to include anything negative about yourself

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:06pm EDT
yeah

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:06pm EDT
idk i felt like

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:06pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:07pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:07pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:07pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:07pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:07pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:07pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:07pm EDT
after all you wouldn't want to talk about yourself

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:07pm EDT
in an essay about yourself

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:07pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:08pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:09pm EDT
yeah talkig like that makes you seem like your just talking out of your ass, but you don't want to seem like you dont care or aren't confident

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:10pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:12pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:17pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
just a bit

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:20pm EDT
at least you have more than 2 paragraphs

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
i need other words instead of involved and participate

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
omg

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
volunteer, help out with...

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:24pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:24pm EDT
volunteer yeah

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:24pm EDT
Being involved has not had a negative affect on the focus I have on my school work, either. I have maintained honor roll throughout my entire education and have received an award for Academic Excellence in each of my years here at High School East. WOOOOOOMP

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:25pm EDT
that one is good

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:25pm EDT
affect or effect?

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:25pm EDT
nevermind ignore it

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:25pm EDT
lol

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:25pm EDT
i think its affect

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:25pm EDT
it is affect

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:25pm EDT
wait

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:25pm EDT
no

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:25pm EDT
its effect

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
itd be affect if i said it hasn't negatively affected my focus on school itself

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
should i leave it like that though? it's just this short little thing

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
thats the entire paragraph?

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
yeah it's right after when i talk about how involved i am in peer leadership and french club

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
well the essay is only supposed to be 250 words

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
or around there

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:27pm EDT
maybe shorter paragraphs are better

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
minimum 250

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
lol

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
ahhhhh

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
minimum changes things

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
i love rambling

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
minimum means minimum means i can TECHNICALLY write however much i want

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
ed

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
that thing you said at the sail party about arrogance

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
was it "Arrogance is like confidence but better." cause i feel like it was.

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
sounds like something i'd say

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
i meant to put it in my quotations section. because that was one of the best things you've ever said

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
i'm putting it there now.

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
"Hogwarts looks evil but it teaches kids to be good, and Villandry looks lovely and sweet but it teaches people to be Namekian Shinigami Death Eaters. Pwned." "Professional mather at your service: Doing math like no problem." "What time is it?" '8:41.' "Really..?" *silence* "Oh.. It's not summertime..?.."

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
kerry, doug, amanda, respectively

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
OK BACK TO NHS

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
i got 5 setnece completed since i got home

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
progress

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
yesss

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
still cant think of a sentence for that last paragraph

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
Another one of my goals for this year is to continue being involved in the things I am now as well as become involved in new things. ___________ because I am a reliable and responsible person who has come to enjoy participating in school activities and can do what is expected of me. Becoming a member of NHS will help me not only become even more involved in school (aside from classes) but enable me to put everything I have personally learned to additional use as well as help my peers and give back to my community. ~

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
"I am sure that NHS would be a great organiztion for me to join..."

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
excelllent

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
you are wonderful

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
it also makes it seem like you are doing them a fovour by joining them

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
this punctuality paragraph is bothering me

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
i have a problem

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
with saying what i want to say

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
with projecting my thoughts

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
outside of my head

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
to anywhere

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
There are many things about myself, just like anyone else, that can be improved on but there are also things about myself and things I have done that I take pride in. For example, I am a very punctual individual. I make it a priority to arrive where I need to be on time and to attend meetings that I am expected to attend. Being absent or late would be an aberration, which is also directly displayed in my high school records as I have perfect attendance. Aside from my punctuality, I am a trustworthy, honest person and I am respectful to those around me. see how that ends like that. the first thing that pops into my head is a teacher saying "HOW are you this this and this?"

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:44pm EDT
the best way is to provide an example

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:45pm EDT
maybe a short anectdote

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:45pm EDT
usually. not that i can think of one

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:45pm EDT
which is bad

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:45pm EDT
555 words haha

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:45pm EDT
maybe a bit

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
well i mean. being respectful i feel like that goes without saying

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
obviously i'm not interrupting class

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
and being an asshole

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
and fucking shit up

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
cause then i'd get in trouble

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
and that's frowned upon

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
i'm a good kid.

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:46pm EDT
its not that frowned upon

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
i mean they have a superlative for it

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
oh?

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
most likely to get in trouble

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
or something like that

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
ooooooooh right

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
well

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
yeah

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
but thats not GETTING in trouble

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
theres a difference

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:47pm EDT
anywaaaay

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
i might need to wake up early and finish this

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
bc i still gotta do my lit hw o.O

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:50pm EDT
Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, “Make the most of yourself, for that is all there is of you.” Much of our time in life is spent trying to find ourselves as people and trying to be the best we can be. Reflecting on this quote by Emerson, I have come to the realization that it is never too late to change, improve, and become more involved in what is happening around you. Part of finding yourself involves figuring out what you like doing and what makes you feel a sense of accomplishment. Another part is taking pride in your accomplishments and using that pride to more forward and continue doing what you do best. There are many things about myself, just like anyone else, that can be improved on but there are also things about myself and things I have done that I take pride in. For example, I am a very punctual individual. I make it a priority to arrive where I need to be on time and to attend meetings that I am expected to attend. Being absent or late would be an aberration, which is also directly displayed in my high school records as I have perfect attendance. Aside from my punctuality, I am a trustworthy, honest person and I am respectful to those around me. As shown in the clubs I am involved in and the community service I do outside of school, I am capable of displaying leadership qualities. The more I enjoy something, the more likely I am to participate. This is particularly shown in my involvement in French Club and Peer Leadership. I have been a member of the French Club all throughout high school and became an active member of French Club and Peer Leadership during my sophomore year. I have participated in activities such as door decorating for Halloween, Trick-or-Treat at High School East, organization of the Coffee Shop held every Spring, painting for French International week, and the Harbor House Clean Up, to name a few. Volunteering for these activities has been fun each year and I plan to continue to do them this year. I also came into my senior year with the intention of running for a position in office for French Club, however it was not possible for me to do so. Being involved has not had a negative effect on the focus I have on my school work, either. I have maintained honor roll throughout my entire education and have received an award for Academic Excellence in each of my years here at High School East, which I hope to do the same this year. Another one of my goals for my senior year is to continue being involved in the things I am now as well as become involved in new things. I’m sure that National Honor Society would be a great organization for me to join because I am a reliable and responsible person who has come to enjoy participating in school activities and can do what is expected of me. Becoming a member of National Honor Society will help me not only become even more involved in school (aside from classes) but enable me to put everything I have personally learned to additional use as well as help my peers and give back to my community. That's my essay.

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
erase the parenthesis and whats inside

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
cause earlier i kind of did

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
and i erased it

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 10:59pm EDT
" Being absent or late would be an aberration, which is also directly displayed in my high school records as I have perfect attendance." I love that sentence

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
i hope that wasn't sarcastic

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
no

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
i just love how prideful it is

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
like you dare assume i would associate myself with peasants that would arrive tardy??!

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
Ahaha

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:02pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:02pm EDT
This paragraphs has the most awkward feeling about it for me

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT
Meeee too

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT
but i need to finish my outro paragraph then i will go over it

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT
since i want to finish before midnight

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT
It's messy

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT
Jk

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:03pm EDT
Kk *

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:04pm EDT
I like how I see the word year three times right next to each other

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:04pm EDT
yeah thats never good

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:05pm EDT
i am always annoyed and how hung up i get over the composition of these things as if it was being graded as opposed to being concerned over the content since it is more going to be used to judge me

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:05pm EDT
but i feel like making sure it has good composition will show that i am a good student

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
thats what i was going to say

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
in response lol

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
it'll sound better anyway

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
yeah

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
and make it seem like you are smart enough to actually be in there

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:07pm EDT
yeah, here while your doing whatever, you can find obvious errors in my two body paragraphs

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:07pm EDT
i don;t have intro or outro yet

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:07pm EDT
I also came into my senior year with the intention of running for a position in office for French Club, however it was not possible for me to do so. this sentence feels random wherever i place it. h8 lyf3.

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:07pm EDT
whyyyy

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:07pm EDT
welll the intro should be easy

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:07pm EDT
i feel like the intro's easier to do

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:07pm EDT
I try to discover all the things East has to offer. I know there are dozens of clubs and activities happening all the time, which could either need help or just want people to attend their events. I go to as many of these activities as possible, and assist them with whatever they need. Although it is impossible to go to all the clubs I want since there are only so many days in the week, I still am able to be a regular member of many organizations like Junior Statesmen of America, Strategy club, and Math League. I have much more active roles in Ping Pong, and Juggling club as well. I created the Juggling club because I love to juggle and really want to teach as many people as possible how to juggle, because it is such a simple and interesting talent to have. The more serious activities I am involved with include being part of the Chess Team and a member of the Color Guard, both of which can take over 10 hours every week. I like helping people do things. I almost always do better work on a project when I am helping someone else as opposed to doing my own work. I enjoy volunteer events for my church, or the library, at school, pretty much anywhere possible. At the library I often attend events and occasionally volunteer, but one of the best ways I have been able to find ways to volunteer is the youth group I have been a part of since I moved to Toms River in 2nd grade. I have received dozens of opportunities to volunteer from being a part of youth group. I’ve helped serve food at soup kitchens, and take care of children at Vacation Bible School. At school I just make it a priority to attend any events such as blood drives or helping with the Junior prom.

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:07pm EDT
your right about the intro

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:08pm EDT
and i really need to work on transitions

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:08pm EDT
i just noticed the lack of one between these two

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:09pm EDT
yeah i was gonna say there's such a jump between paragraphs

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:09pm EDT
I enjoy volunteer events for my church, or the library, at school, pretty much anywhere possible. i don't like this sentence.

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:09pm EDT
neither do i, i've been jumping all over the place in this essay so there is very little flow

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:10pm EDT
At school I just make it a priority to attend any events such as blood drives or helping with the Junior prom. i'd take out Junior. just because it seems so specific. you say attend events, so you can just say prom. or school dances or something

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
I enjoy volunteering for events at my church, library, school, or anywhere possible. idk. i don't like anywhere possible.

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
what a generic word for prom?

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
dances?

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:12pm EDT
.. prom. or like i said school dances. dances yeah

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:12pm EDT
cause theres winter formal, homecoming, junior, and senior prom

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:12pm EDT
most of which i do Something for

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:12pm EDT
if not much

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:12pm EDT
not that i will mention that

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
Volunteering for these activities has been fun each time and I plan to continue to do them this year. I also came into my senior year with the intention of running for a position in office for French Club; unfortunately it was not possible for me to do so due to the absence of ____ should i mention her name? due to the absence of the advisor...

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
current absence, even. idk.

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
say an advisor

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
not the advisor

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:16pm EDT
and include something about tring to keep the club/activity/ whatever up and running even with their lack of presence

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:16pm EDT
well she is *the* advisor really. without mme doulong, our school's only french teacher, there is no french club cause i don't believe the lady took that over..

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:16pm EDT
but okay

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:16pm EDT
i could mention like, later year stuff?

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:16pm EDT
yeah i knwo its *the* advisor which is why it seems like your blaming her specifically

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
cause i mean she IS going to be back. she's just got a child. but imean we still have the coffee shop maybe

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
feels the same as mentioning her name

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
true

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
i can mention that? hoping to continue other french club events later on in the year upon her return or something

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
metion your plans for later in the year yeah

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
However, I do plan to [try to] continue French Club events later in the year upon the advisor’s return.

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
good enough

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
try to is in brackets cause idk if i should leave it in or take itout

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
might as well mention her name though if your using it like that

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
don;t say try

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
there is no try

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
only do

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
or do not

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
:D

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
i'm actually more determined to

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:19pm EDT
cause i will be pissed if i can't

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
the ONE YEAR i can actually run shit

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
like officially can

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
and she;s gone

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
and she isn't here

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
exactly

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
totally steling your quote intro btw

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
don't live like there's no tomorrow, that's stupid, but live your life like it's a story you want to tell someone else.

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
without the "that's stupid part"

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
upon HER return? their return? i cant say an, i can say the then right?

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
that sounds good to me!

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
just use her name

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
never

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
you mention her too much not to

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
i'll say her instead.

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
i feel like that's too like.. weird. idk.

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:21pm EDT
like that isn't something i should say

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
still got no examples of trustworthiness and honesty and respect. like specific events that stick. i can get away with just leaving it like that i think right? probably not. i feel like this is something that points are going to be taken off of lol

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
idk just keep referring to her as if you had stated her name

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
and the trustworthy thing

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
meh, i don't really know your life, so i can't really list any exaples for you

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
yeah lol well i mean like. obvious things that aren't like.

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
do you know what i mean?

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
like i don't run off telling people things that are personal and that people have no business knowing

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
if someone confides in me with something i'm not gonna be like OH HEY YEAH THIS GIRL...

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
toh!

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
use that part about listenning to other people

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
as your example for the trustworthy honest thing

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
like how you listen to other peoples problems etc

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT
and help them out

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:28pm EDT
Aside from my punctuality, I am a trustworthy, honest person and I am respectful to those around me. If someone confides in me, I will listen to their problems and try my best to help them out without being judgmental. or i can take out 'without being judgmental'. or I will listen to what they have to say or Should someone confide in me, I will listen to what they have to say and do my best to help them without being judgmental. Should someone confide in me, I will listen to their problems and do my best to help them without being judgmental.

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
you don't need the aside from punctuality part

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
but i guess you do

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
as a transition

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:29pm EDT
it just seem repetitious

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:30pm EDT
you still need to delete "i am" before respectful

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:30pm EDT
check

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:30pm EDT
aside from this?

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:30pm EDT
and yeah the judgmental part is supercilious as well

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:31pm EDT
i hate saying that though

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:31pm EDT
yeah i am terrible with creating transitions

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:31pm EDT
i do need the I am in there

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:31pm EDT
i am awesome and respect others

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
i am awesome and i am respectuful

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
I am a __ __ PERSON, and respectful to those

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:32pm EDT
if i took out the whatever person,

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
it'd be i am a respectful to those around me

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
yeah that might be even better

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
to just delete the first part and say i am respectful

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
i can just say

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
trustworthy and respectful though

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
i mean

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
cause confiding , trustworthy

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:33pm EDT
honest has nothing to do with the next sentence

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:34pm EDT
changes to those things have been made

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:34pm EDT
i think i'm done..

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:34pm EDT
i mean it sounds ok

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:34pm EDT
i guess

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:35pm EDT
awesome

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:35pm EDT
does it? i feel like not even mentioning outside school stuff

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:35pm EDT
like

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:35pm EDT
is not good

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:35pm EDT
library stuff?

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:35pm EDT
yeah and my moms worrk~

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:36pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:36pm EDT
like i mention i DO outside school stuff

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:36pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:36pm EDT
be dont elaborate

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:36pm EDT
but*

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:37pm EDT
idk where i can add in library stuff

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:38pm EDT
This is particularly shown in my involvement in French Club and Peer Leadership and the Ocean County Library .......... blahblahblah sail is cool yo bye

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:38pm EDT
deleting the and between french and peer leadership

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:39pm EDT
the ocean county library first, so it ends with school stuff

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:39pm EDT
akdjghrh

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:39pm EDT
I'd try not listing them

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:39pm EDT
just have seperate sentences explaining each

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:40pm EDT
unlike what i did

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:40pm EDT
i guess but it seems like it just jumps into that then

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:40pm EDT
which was list them

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:40pm EDT
the reason i jus listed them

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:40pm EDT
transitions are hardf

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:40pm EDT
The more I enjoy something, the more likely I am to actively participate in it. This is particularly shown in my involvement in French Club and Peer Leadership. I have been a member of the French Club all throughout high school and blahblahblah if i delete that once sentence

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:40pm EDT
this is particularly shown in my involvement

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT
i dont even wanna mention the library

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT
that is a good sentence to delete

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT
why not?

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT
but i feel like i need to

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT
volunteer stuff is important

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT
yeah

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT
so start with the library? then school stuff

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT
cause then it continues with school stuff

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:41pm EDT
probably

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
go from aight stuff, to weak middle, the strongest stuff last

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
thats the format i usually use

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
people never pay attention to the middle anyway

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
what does sail stand for again

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:42pm EDT
Service and Achievement in the Library

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:47pm EDT
For the past two summers I have volunteered at the Ocean County Library as a member of S.A.I.L (Service and Achievement in the Library) where I mainly shelved books, looked for books that belonged to other library branches, and helped out with various events. ~

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:47pm EDT
something along those lines

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:48pm EDT
explain more about the events and less about the labor

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:48pm EDT
since NHS is about events

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:48pm EDT
hmm

Steph DudakTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:48pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, October 18, 2011 at 11:52pm EDT
“Don't live like there's no tomorrow. Live your life like it's a story you want to tell someone else.” This advice from Philip DeFranco one of my favorite quotations because it describes perfectly how I feel life should be lived. I do not want to throw my life away just to feel a rush of excitement, but I want to be able to say I’ve done something with my life if ever asked to describe myself. One of the best ways to describe someone is to tell a story about them, and if there is no story to tell, then there is not much to know about that person. I do not want to be a person without a story, I want to be able to say I made an impact and have affected things around me.

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:01am EDT
I apply these traits of mine when I am volunteering because no one remembers the lazy person who is rude to everyone and can not be trusted with simple responsibilities.

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:01am EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:02am EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:03am EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:03am EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:06am EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:08am EDT
meh. then i'll have; Just as I apply these traits to everyday occurrences, I apply them when volunteering. As shown in the clubs I am involved in and the community service I do outside of school, I am also capable of displaying leadership qualities.

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:08am EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:08am EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:13am EDT
skdhjlskh

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:13am EDT
h8 this

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:13am EDT
so much

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:13am EDT
Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, “Make the most of yourself, for that is all there is of you.” Much of our time in life is spent trying to find ourselves as people and trying to be the best we can be. Reflecting on this quote by Emerson, I have come to the realization that it is never too late to change, improve, and become more involved in what is happening around you. Part of finding yourself involves figuring out what you like doing and what makes you feel a sense of accomplishment. Another part is taking pride in your accomplishments and using that pride to more forward and continue doing what you do best. There are many things about myself, just like everyone else, that can be improved on, but there are also things about myself and things I have done that I take pride in. For example, I am a very punctual individual. I make it a priority to arrive on time and to attend meetings that I am expected to attend. Being absent or late would be an aberration, which is also directly displayed in my high school records as I have perfect attendance. Aside from my punctuality, I am a trustworthy person and I am respectful to those around me. Should someone confide in me, I will listen to their problems and try my best to help them without being judgmental. As shown in the clubs I am involved in and the community service I do outside of school, I am also capable of displaying leadership qualities. The more I enjoy something, the more likely I am to actively participate in it. For the past two summers I have volunteered at the Ocean County Library as a member of S.A.I.L (Service and Achievement in the Library) where I mainly shelved books, looked for books that belonged to other library branches, and helped out with various events including Bookfest, the S.A.I.L parties, and puppet shows for kids. In school, I have been a member of the French Club since freshman year and became an active member of French Club and Peer Leadership during my sophomore year. I have participated in activities such as door decorating for Halloween, Trick-or-Treat at High School East, organization of the Coffee Shop held every Spring, painting for French International week, and the Harbor House Clean Up, to name a few. Volunteering for these activities has been fun each time and I plan to continue to do them. I also came into my senior year with a goal of running for a position in office for French Club; unfortunately it was not possible for me to do so due to the absence of an advisor. However, I do plan to continue French Club events during the rest of the year upon her return. Being involved has not had a negative effect on the focus I have on my school work, either. I have maintained honor roll throughout my entire education and have received an award for Academic Excellence in each of my years here at High School East, which I hope to do again this year. If anything, being involved helps me continue to do well in school because it makes me even more determined to get things done and get them done correctly. Another one of my goals for my senior year is to continue being involved in the things I am now as well as become involved in new things. I am sure that National Honor Society would be a great organization for me to join because I am a reliable and responsible person who has come to enjoy participating in school activities and can do what is expected of me. Becoming a member of National Honor Society will help me not only become even more involved in school but enable me to put everything I have learned to additional use as well as help my peers and give back to my community. thats it, final draft

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:14am EDT
its written in english

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:14am EDT
don't even care.

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:16am EDT
My mom was bugging out as I was writing it before

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:16am EDT
All done. Not gonna have a teacher look at it. Make sure you know what to write. Blahblahblah

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:16am EDT
Mom I don't even care if I get in at this point

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:17am EDT
But I'd like to think this essay is better than the first

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:17am EDT
Time to do lit, fml

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:17am EDT
ugh have fun, I'm gonna be doing homework in all my classes tomorrow

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:17am EDT
Wait.

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:18am EDT
doing

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:18am EDT
You know what, whatever. This better be allowed to be over 250 words.

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:18am EDT
250 words is like a paragraph

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:18am EDT
I'll triple check

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:19am EDT
it says approximately

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:19am EDT
250

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:19am EDT
mine's not even done and its already almost 500

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:19am EDT
ughh

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:19am EDT
Doesn't that mean it should really be about 250 words

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:20am EDT
yep

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:20am EDT
fml

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:20am EDT
So basically

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:20am EDT
I can just

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:20am EDT
i might just delete my intro

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:20am EDT
Kill myself

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:20am EDT
I can delete the middle stuff?

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:20am EDT
i was thinking delete every other word in your essay

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:20am EDT
just cause it'd be funny

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:21am EDT
and i'd recommend deleting intro or outro

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:21am EDT
cause the bodies explain why you are awesome

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:21am EDT
as opposed to just being intros and outros

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:21am EDT
72 words intro

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:21am EDT
With the quote

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
I still like the quote. What if I start with that but then jump to

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
you might just only want to include your activites and not the personal stuff?

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
Maybe

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
But that's like half the application

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
or just make a shitty everything deleted copy and ask if it is alright to be way over the limit

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:22am EDT
or if it needs to be shortened

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:23am EDT
I'm keeping this one

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:23am EDT
if it has to be 250 give her the edited one

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:23am EDT
But yeah printing out a second

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:23am EDT
that is less good

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:23am EDT
Way shorter version

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:23am EDT
Yep

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:23am EDT
I'm def taking out the paragraph before the final one

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:23am EDT
plan made

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:23am EDT
How it hasn't affected my school work

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:23am EDT
Bc that's obvious

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:23am EDT
go do your world lit

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:24am EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:24am EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:24am EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:24am EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:24am EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:24am EDT
except fun

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:24am EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:24am EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:24am EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
to use for something else

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
i could think of one or two other purposes for it right now

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
Fuck this shit

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
that being a main one

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:25am EDT
An ESSAY. She should have written write a paragraph

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:26am EDT
i agree

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:26am EDT
250 words is not an ~essay. I can't say anything in 250 words

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:26am EDT
Well if it has to be that short maybe that's why I got rejected

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:26am EDT
not if its in essay form at least

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:26am EDT
Inability to follow directions

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:26am EDT
that would be ridiculous

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:26am EDT
and highly likely

Steph DudakWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:27am EDT
Hangs self

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 19, 2011 at 12:28am EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:51pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
she said it should be about two pages but she's kind of expecting our class' to be more

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
but you cant really end a sentecne with that

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
and that good then

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
you don't write short stories well

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
oh

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
I KNOW

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
i didnt double space it tho

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
;_;

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
hold on

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
does it need to be double spaced

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
nah i don't think so

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:52pm EDT
that'd be dumb

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
plus doing that it'd be four pages SO

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
make it like 1.25 spaced or something

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
well it's not like an essay

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
it's written like

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:53pm EDT
then don't do anything with it

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:54pm EDT
yeah

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:54pm EDT
but besides this i need to write a rough draft of a college esssay

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:54pm EDT
due tomorrow along with this.

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:55pm EDT
ugghhh I keep forgetting about college stuff, I still need to make a portfolio

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:55pm EDT
i don't even have any art junk

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
do you do anything with like photoshop and stuff

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
nope, just paint

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
well

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
minecraft too

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
would they cont that?

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
cause i mean instead of spending a buncha time doin minecraft stuff, you could do some typography stuff and other cool things

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
lol

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
idk

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:56pm EDT
If they did I'd be set

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:57pm EDT
well then again, the stuff you make in minecraft.. not all of it is original stuff

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
yeah, but i am translating it into a new medium though, its not like there were schematics for that companion cube, I just used a picture from the game

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
or the pokemon statues

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
yeah

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:58pm EDT
but i don't think i could just make a portfolio of that

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:59pm EDT
no

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:59pm EDT
you can't

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:59pm EDT
but what i'm saying is you should probably have a good portion of original stuff yk

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 8:59pm EDT
yeah, I will probably have to mess with prodesktop and make some stuff

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 9:00pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 9:00pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
well the beginning of the tale

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT
The crowd cheered as the champions stepped onto the field. A young lady from Beauxbatons and a young man from Durmstrang Stood properly and quietly as everyone sang.

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
to go in that space

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
Not one of them looked ready to yield

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
or something like that

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
add more words to make it flow

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
and make sense

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 9:40pm EDT
hm

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 9:41pm EDT
The crowd cheered as the champions stepped onto the field With looks on their faces showing they were not going to yield. does that sound weird

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 9:41pm EDT
idkidk

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 9:42pm EDT
thats so long

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 9:43pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:11pm EDT
i thought i forgot about one

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:11pm EDT
no lol. it's based off hogwarts. not using the actual people in the books and movies

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:12pm EDT
its cool cause our class has 8 people, so there's 2 people in every house lol

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:12pm EDT
gotcha

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:13pm EDT
i like some of the rhymes

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:13pm EDT
some of them i don't but i don't feel like fixing em lol

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:13pm EDT
like some don't flow as nicely

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:14pm EDT
The only problem is the flow, which takes real authors like weeks anyway

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:14pm EDT
rhyming can get difficult

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:14pm EDT
but i think it's pretty okay for just putting something down on paper

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:15pm EDT
enough of it flows that the teacher should be fine

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:15pm EDT
Outrages as she was, the Slytherin kept her cool.

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:15pm EDT
error

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:15pm EDT
o thanks

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:16pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:16pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:16pm EDT
oh its not done lol

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:16pm EDT
i'm trynna figure out what's gonna happen

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:16pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:17pm EDT
funfun

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:17pm EDT
basically vivian's gonna get away with everything

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:17pm EDT
and win the tournament tho

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:17pm EDT
-_-

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:17pm EDT
muahaha

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:18pm EDT
heartless

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:18pm EDT
that's how it's gotta be yo!

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:18pm EDT
her plan can't be foiled!

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:18pm EDT
she's devious and perfect in everyway and does not stop until she is victorious

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:18pm EDT
~~~

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
clearly

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
well actually lol the slytherin in here isn't exactly vivian

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
but it could be

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:19pm EDT
they're just very similar

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
whatever, if you want to be that evil author that torments her creations

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
XD

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT
YES

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:21pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:25pm EDT
not cool

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:25pm EDT
ah well, its better that way i suppose

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
The two champions had been tricked into grabbing the portkey While the Slytherin girl watched and laughed evilly. i'm so good. i seriously don't know how to end this.

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:26pm EDT
at all

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
evilly has two l's?

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
looks gross

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
yes evilly has two ls

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:28pm EDT
it looks lovely

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
i don't like it, but anyway. do you seriously want her to come out winning?

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
how often does the bad guy win

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
all right

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:29pm EDT
then just have her smugly walk back to the crowd

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
and everyone being astonished

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:30pm EDT
then have a little story about how the two other competitors either ended up living happily ever after together in some hick town

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
LOL

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
or died gruesomely in some death bog of nastiness

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
hmmm

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
both are good

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
i like the last option.

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
there you go

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
because then it's like ~hey i'm a future death eater but you have no proof i did anything

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:31pm EDT
yeah i gotta make it seem like she's completely clueless as to what is going on

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
i should make all that the epilogue

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
everyone realizes the other two never came out

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
i mean, people do die in this tournament.

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
but they do come out. their bloody corpses thrown back outside of the maze with the portkey or something

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
that might be a little much

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
a bit

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
talk about morbid

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:32pm EDT
just say all that was found was like his scarf or something

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
or a wand

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
something symbolic

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
alright so lets see here

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
wait

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
what if i end that there

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
and then have an ~epilogue of vivian actually talking and summarizing what happened. would that be weird

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:33pm EDT
like

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:34pm EDT
hm

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
or end it with her coming out with the real cup

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
and everyone bein like awww yeeeah!

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
or like wtf?

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
and THEN the epilogue comes

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
which explains what happens to the other two

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
and vivian's like. yeah they found out shortly after that the other two vanished

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:35pm EDT
apparently they died, all they found was their wands

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:36pm EDT
either it could be vivian explaining it

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:36pm EDT
or told as if it's some urban legend

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:36pm EDT
no one ever found out how they died

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:36pm EDT
its said that their ghosts still haunt these very grounds oOoOo~~~

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:36pm EDT
like that

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
oh that sucks. there's like

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
there's a ghost

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
in this

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
like. that's kind of a narrator of all of our prologues

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
like as a third person thing observing the class yk.

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
and he died in the school

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:37pm EDT
but he actually went to hogwarts

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:38pm EDT
but he died bc he was like eaten by fluffy or something weird like that. trynna get below the trap door to see what was actually there

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:38pm EDT
but anyway

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:40pm EDT
i feel like she has to reason to have these people basically killed

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:40pm EDT
then again. death eaters don't really need a reason do they

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
well you could have it like malfoy complex character which has him like giving into his family and feeling lost or go with bellatrix lestrange characterization "she's bat shit crazy

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
i'd go for the latter here

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:42pm EDT
yeah that's true

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
i feel like i could have her as a mix of the two

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
but then again

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
yeah

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:43pm EDT
i keep forgetting the slytherin in the tale isn't vivian so it works fine.

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:44pm EDT
She made her way to the real Tri-Wizard Cup and exited the maze victoriously. The roar of the crowd greeted her happily With cheers coming from every direction blankity blankity blank

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
its fine, the wording is meh, but you got your point across and it rhymes

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:48pm EDT
i need one more line

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
after direction

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
so its like BAM. i win. bye.

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
but with a word that rhymes

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
she was so happy it felt if she an--

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
maybe not the best for school

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
ummm

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:49pm EDT
idk

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT
x.x

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT
i kinda feel like you should try that and see what happends

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT
oh and i looked this up for you

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:51pm EDT
List all words ending with tion 2587 words found

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
so that's fun

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
affection is the first one that comes to mind buut yeah lol

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:52pm EDT
um would it be weird to rhyme them with.. them..

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
well my mind is in the gutter, and dr. suess does that all the time so its fine

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
lawl. this sounds so dumb whatev

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
‘Shortly after, everyone knew something was awry And the parents in the stands started to cry. The Beauxbatons and Durmstrang champions were forever gone Though not a single trace could be drawn To what had actually happened to them. A wand was what was left from each of them.

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:53pm EDT
i'm bad at endings

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
i should just be like YEP so that girl from slytherin wins and everyone else dies but no one figures out it was all part of her plan. the end.

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
A wand was what was left from each of them. A wand was all that was left from them.

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:54pm EDT
and yes you should

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
fixed

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
akdjhgrh i can't actually do that -.-

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
i did it

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
wrote a 13 page "scary story" in 8th grade

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
we had to read them out loud

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
and i was like ffffffff

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
oh god

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:55pm EDT
so after like page 2

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
i said, "and then the SWAT team came and everyone was saved except the people that died. the end"

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:56pm EDT
XD

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
which was irrelevant since it was about people living in sewers after a apocalypse

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
and they were in like europe

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
hahahaha

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:57pm EDT
omg lol

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 10:58pm EDT
lol i need to double space this. fuck me.

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
well its not like trees are that important anyway

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
naaah

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:00pm EDT
and its not like i'm running outta ink

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
moar blue papers

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
anyway

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
I NEED TO END THIS.

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
luckily this is only 5 pages

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
and not 9

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
lol only~

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:01pm EDT
it's three without the double space

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:02pm EDT
i still need that one line after direction omg wtf

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:05pm EDT
http://www.morewords.com/ends-with/tion/

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:05pm EDT
that should help

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:05pm EDT
not really

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
tl;dr

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
lol

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:06pm EDT
thanks

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:08pm EDT
i should change that other line

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:08pm EDT
cause the last has to basically say how she had gotten away with it

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:10pm EDT
why?

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
She made her way to the real Tri-Wizard Cup and exited the maze victoriously. The roar of the crowd greeted her happily With cheers coming from every direction There had not been a single accusation Of the Slytherin girl having caused these unfortunate events.

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
y/n

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
i see nothing wrong so far

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
awesome

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:11pm EDT
‘Shortly after, everyone figured something was awry And the parents in the stands started to cry. The Beauxbatons and Durmstrang champions were forever gone Though not a single trace could be drawn To what had actually happened to them. A wand was all that was left from them.’ so thenthere's that

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
looks good

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
and it actually flows

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
should i end it just like that?

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:14pm EDT
with nothing else?

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:15pm EDT
if you imagine a person saying it, it sounds pretty like. mysterious

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:17pm EDT
works for me

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT
i feel like you could expand but there;s really no reason to

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT
yeah i feel like it's odd just leaving it like that

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT
but at the same time not?

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:18pm EDT
i just don't really know how to expand it so it's like ~

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
i'd say just leave it

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
due tomorrow?

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
yep

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:20pm EDT
bien sûr

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
just leave it

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
its almost midnight

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:22pm EDT
time to write one more paper that'll take only a few minutes because i'm not going to use the common app prompts

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:23pm EDT
but the prompt from my drexel app that only requires 250-500 words

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
all i wrote on mine was "I am signing up for any college that gave me a free application so I applied"

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
which I am extremely annoyed bu

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
by

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
i thought it was just a paragraph, not the actual essay

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:24pm EDT
and i can't fix, I've emailed and asked

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:25pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
just leave it and turn it in, its fine

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
i doubt she will mark off for it

Nick DevlinSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
hipefully

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
im telling her she has to accept it

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
bc im running low on ink

Steph DudakSunday, October 23, 2011 at 11:27pm EDT
it's either blue ink & helvetica

Steph DudakWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:36pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:37pm EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
well that's good then

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:38pm EDT
i'm guessing your homework won't be keeping you up all night again?

Steph DudakWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
i don't have homework tonight? that i know of.

Steph DudakWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
which i find really peculiar

Steph DudakWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
i mean i could read those pages

Steph DudakWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
which i might before i go to bed

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
maybe the universe decided that you worked so much last night that you can rest tonight

Steph DudakWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
but probably not. i might just skim it, get the main idea. take some notes on it so i dont have to actually retain the information

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
or something

Steph DudakWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:39pm EDT
not looking forward to critiquing my one art project tomorrow

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:40pm EDT
not looking foward to tomorrow in general

Steph DudakWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:41pm EDT
yeah that too

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:48pm EDT
ah well, I will most likely miss half of it due to memory loss

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:48pm EDT
lack of sleep does that apparently

Steph DudakWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:49pm EDT
slightly

Steph DudakWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:49pm EDT
i mean

Steph DudakWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:49pm EDT
i went into mr dispotos however you spell it, room for tape and came out with paper

Steph DudakWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:49pm EDT
so

Steph DudakWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:49pm EDT
minor malfunction.

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:50pm EDT
minor

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:50pm EDT
i do that every day

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:50pm EDT
so it can't be that ba-- well, actually if i do it every day that actually sounds very bad

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT
ughghghghgh really want to mock kristyn

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT
i mean her comments just beg for it

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:51pm EDT
resist

Steph DudakWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
mock her anyway

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
Guys, I really don't care about chess. I only chose it as an example because it is significantly less likely for me to be injured playing chess than it is for me to be injured playing hockey like I was today. That is all.

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
I mean really?

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
That is just too easy

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
I could totally just ramble on about this guy who broke his leg

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:52pm EDT
or a fight that broke out

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:53pm EDT
or someone who broke a finger

Steph DudakWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:53pm EDT
hahaha

Steph DudakWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:53pm EDT
what the heck

Steph DudakWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:53pm EDT
where is this from

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:53pm EDT
her status about how much she sucks at hockey

Steph DudakWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT
oh

Steph DudakWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:54pm EDT
oh wha

Steph DudakWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT
wah

Steph DudakWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT
*

Steph DudakWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT
apparently i cant spell today either

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT
spelling is not a priorit on facebook chat i dont think

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:55pm EDT
which is why i constantly am spellchecking the things i write on facebook chat

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:56pm EDT
priority*

Steph DudakWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:56pm EDT
see

Steph DudakWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:56pm EDT
i didn't even notice you spelled that wrong

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:57pm EDT
neither did till after i wrote it, glad i had some error though, otherwise my joke would have fallen flat

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:57pm EDT
I missed it the first time i looked through what i wrote to find an error to fix

Nick DevlinWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT
and was kind of disappointed, but then i noticed it! and all was good in the world

Steph DudakWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:58pm EDT
yaaaaay

Steph DudakWednesday, October 26, 2011 at 9:59pm EDT
