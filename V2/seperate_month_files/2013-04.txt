why

Nick DevlinThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:06am EDT
tired

Nick DevlinThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:06am EDT
dont wanna analyze poetry

Steph DudakThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:06am EDT
don't

Steph DudakThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:06am EDT
go to bed

Nick DevlinThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:07am EDT
due at 8am tomorrow

Steph DudakThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:07am EDT
what are you analyzing

Nick DevlinThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:08am EDT
but I'm analyzing the poetic like grammar of it

Nick DevlinThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:08am EDT
meter and iambs and foots

Steph DudakThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:08am EDT
booooo

Nick DevlinThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:08am EDT
mhmm

Nick DevlinThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:08am EDT
at least their super easy to figure out

Nick DevlinThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:08am EDT
but still

Nick DevlinThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:08am EDT
brain

Nick DevlinThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:08am EDT
sad

Nick DevlinThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:12am EDT
why are you awake?

Nick DevlinThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:12am EDT
no you always are up till like 5 am right?>

Steph DudakThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:14am EDT
yeah im never asleep at this time lol

Steph DudakThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:14am EDT
i have physics homework to do

Nick DevlinThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:14am EDT
ahh

Nick DevlinThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:14am EDT
gotchu

Steph DudakThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:14am EDT
like three sheets

Nick DevlinThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:14am EDT
sounds delightful

Steph DudakThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:14am EDT
it isn't

Steph DudakThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:14am EDT
let me show you this one question

Steph DudakThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:16am EDT
a 50 kg hiker starts at an elevation of 2500m and climbs to the top of a 3500m mountain in 4 hrs. A) what was the work done by the hiker? B) what was his power output in watts? C) what was his power output in horse power? (1 hp = 750 watts)

Steph DudakThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:16am EDT
oh okay uppercase b) is a smiley

Steph DudakThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:16am EDT
not a hard problem but why

Steph DudakThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:16am EDT
is the hiker a car or some sort of electrical thing

Steph DudakThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:16am EDT
i don't understand

Nick DevlinThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:17am EDT
is the hitchiker a car

Nick DevlinThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:17am EDT
wel

Nick DevlinThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:17am EDT
it seems the questions havent gotten any better

Nick DevlinThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:17am EDT
since high school

Nick DevlinThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:18am EDT
such weird things to ask

Steph DudakThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:18am EDT
IT MAKES NO SENSE UNLESS HE'S A CAR I DON'T SEE WHY I'M CALCULATING HIS WORK IN WATTS AND HORSEPOWER ailable from the flow of water over the dam at the art museum. Water has a density of 1g/cubic cm=1000kg/cubic meter

Steph DudakThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:18am EDT
excuse me

Nick DevlinThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:18am EDT
excused

Steph DudakThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:18am EDT
sorry half that question

Steph DudakThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:18am EDT
got cut off

Nick DevlinThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:18am EDT
maybe the hiker want to BE a car

Nick DevlinThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:18am EDT
and he wants to know how fast he would be after the operation

Steph DudakThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:18am EDT
estimate the power available from the flow of water over the dam at the art museum. Water has a density of 1g/cubic cm=1000kg/cubic meter

Steph DudakThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:22am EDT
let me estimate that for you

Steph DudakThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:22am EDT
stupid

Nick DevlinThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:26am EDT
very stupid

Nick DevlinThursday, April 4, 2013 at 12:26am EDT
i am sorry

Steph DudakFriday, April 12, 2013 at 9:41pm EDT
i have decided that i am bad at writing papers and can never seem to make a decision on some sort of thesis.

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:16pm EDT
what is the current issue?

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:17pm EDT
Also I slept last night!!! Went to bed at like 10 I have slept in like 2 weeks

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:17pm EDT
was awesome

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:18pm EDT
i was having problems developing where my paper was actually going last night

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:18pm EDT
proud of you!

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:18pm EDT
did you figure out a thesis?

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:19pm EDT
i don't really know. i have this thing Architecture is widely recognized as the designing and construction of buildings. Other things architecture is associated with is right angled walls, traditional rectilinear shapes, and structures that clearly show functionality upon looking at them—up until the end of the Modernist movement of architecture, that is. In the 1980s there is a break in this style of architecture where a movement known as Deconstructivism comes into effect, giving architecture new meaning beyond traditional expectations and structures, changing the way we view architecture today.

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:21pm EDT
and i have like a list of things i want to talk about like - talk about modern architecture (not crazy in depth. just what it entails really) - talk about what deconstructivism is (form of post modern architecture) - mostly talk about it relating to the united states - talk about prominent decon buildings here - talk about prominent decon architects (perhaps Daniel Libeskind Thom Mayne Rem Koolhaas Coop Himmelblau maybe two of them in depth, and then the others in mentioning when i talk about the buildings) - talk about libeskind last because he helps kind of shape what i want to say in that i really want to quote him saying "I think architecture should be risky. . . It should not play it safe because if it plays it safe it is not moving us in the direction that we want to be. And I think, of course, risk is what underlies the world. [A] world without risk would not be worth living." because his views on architecture help my paper and help what deconstructivism is. - then ultimately the effect deconstructivism has on people and how we experience it now

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:21pm EDT
hmmm

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:22pm EDT
you want to write an essay on the transition of traditional to modern american architecture?

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:23pm EDT
i want to talk about a specific movement of architecture that being deconstructivism

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:24pm EDT
but

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:24pm EDT
i can't just talk about it

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:24pm EDT
and in order to describe deconstructivism you need to discuss traditional

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:24pm EDT
gotcha

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:24pm EDT
yes

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:25pm EDT
that's why that last sentence of that paragraph is the way it is kind of because ifeel like it kind of gets at something but perhaps it's underdeveloped?

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:25pm EDT
alright so why did people transition into deconstructivism?

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:28pm EDT
it didn't come into play til the 1980s, it was influenced by Jacques Derrida, a french philosopher as well as Russian Constructivism (art movement, dealt a lot with geometry). but it really came out cause of the 1982 Parc de la Villette architectural design competition. it's a competition to revitalize undeveloped land from the French national wholesale meat market in Paris. that was like the first time you really began seeing "deconstructivist" architecture. the people involved in the competition included eisenman, rem koolhaas, zaha hadid. who are all well known as deconstructivists

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:28pm EDT
(althought they may not describe themselves as such)

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:30pm EDT
So there were no external social events that cause deconstructivism to get started? A couple guys thought it was cool and others followed

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:30pm EDT
There wasnt like any cultural revolutions or nothing taking place?

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:30pm EDT
i dont know any history so thats why i ask

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:35pm EDT
no not really it wasn't a thing that people were like "yeah i'm gonna be a deconstructivist! this is a thing i'm going to do!" it just kind of became and grew as it's own thing. like the thing about it that separates it from other architecture is Deconstructivism is characterized by fragmentation and controlled chaos. it does not appear to be logical. This style focuses on complexity and manipulating a structure, and it includes non-rectilinear shapes that seem to distort elements of conventional architecture. Another common characteristic of deconstructive architecture is its ability to invoke emotion in people experiencing it. If you look at Libeskind's Jewish Berlin museum or his Danish Jewish museum in Copenhagen. it isn't just a building. it's designed to make you feel a certain way when you experience it.

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:36pm EDT
is that the squiggly building?

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:36pm EDT
the berlin museum,

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:37pm EDT
zig zag shaped yee

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:37pm EDT
yeah

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:37pm EDT
either way not too important

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:38pm EDT
hmm this is a difficult topic to write about

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:38pm EDT
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/JewishMuseumBerlinAerial.jpg/300px-JewishMuseumBerlinAerial.jpg belin http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/DanishMuseumInterior.jpg/220px-DanishMuseumInterior.jpg danish it's not a difficult topic to write about

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:38pm EDT
deconstructivism is quite easy actually

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:38pm EDT
it would be for me, but you seem to know a lot about it so that's pretty good

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:40pm EDT
it's quite easy to write about actually. there's plenty of information i've gathered as well as plenty of awesome architects to talk about (not a surprise that most of these deconstructivist architects are my favorites)

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:40pm EDT
are you going to discuss the philosophy behind decon?

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:40pm EDT
there seems to be a lot of that

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:40pm EDT
considering it's influenced by a french philosopher i feel like ishould

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:41pm EDT
yeah everything I google starts talking about philosophy

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:42pm EDT
well yeah but it's also not solely that. i have plenty on what it is. that's why i wrote that one paragraph how i did because it does change what people expect of architecture

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:42pm EDT
Is that paragraph your draft intro

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:42pm EDT
and it brings it into how we look at it today, especially since decon is fairly recent

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:43pm EDT
lol drafts don't exist in this class. but of course i'll be editing when needed

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:43pm EDT
i'm pretty much just trying to write everything out and then go back and fix

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:43pm EDT
good plan

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:44pm EDT
ofjust let me know when you want a final edit and I can go through

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:45pm EDT
thanks however it is like a six page paper

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:46pm EDT
that's why i was just trying to figure that all out but i don't believe the way i'm going about it is really too broad but it's not crazy specific either

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:47pm EDT
nothing you've said seems to be too baod

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:47pm EDT
broad*

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:47pm EDT
and I nuderstood most of it as well, so its not like architecture jargon

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:47pm EDT
nuderstood

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:47pm EDT
nunderstood haha

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:47pm EDT
-.-

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:52pm EDT
i'm going to use this as additional work space, i hope you don't mind. there's a lot of things that need rewording Derridean deconstruction consists in an attempt to re-conceive the difference that divides self-reflection (or self-consciousness)

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:52pm EDT
no problem

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:53pm EDT
in --> of

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:53pm EDT
that was copy and pasted

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:53pm EDT
i didn't write that is what i'm saying

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:53pm EDT
lol

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:53pm EDT
not my fault they were wrong

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:56pm EDT
Derridean deconstruction consists of an attempt to re-conceive the difference that divides self-reflection (or self-consciousness) "the difference that divides self-consciousness"

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:56pm EDT
what does that mean

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:59pm EDT
context por favor

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:59pm EDT
where did you get the quote from

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:59pm EDT
http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/derrida/

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:59pm EDT
first paragraph

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 1:59pm EDT
that part i put in quotes, the whole thing is write above it

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 2:04pm EDT
mm

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 2:10pm EDT
got it

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 2:10pm EDT
took some digging

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 2:12pm EDT
Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 2:13pm EDT
self love and self knowledge

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 2:13pm EDT
is my best bet as to what that means

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 2:15pm EDT
so essentially

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 2:15pm EDT
could i just reword what i showed you before to say

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 2:15pm EDT
His form of deconstruction was meant to understand self-consciousness and what divides it.

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 2:15pm EDT
i only need a basic thing

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 2:15pm EDT
Thats an accurate rewording

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 2:16pm EDT
reflection might be a better word than conciousness, but thats semantics

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 2:18pm EDT
okie

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 2:18pm EDT
yeah i'll use reflection

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 2:24pm EDT
also

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 2:24pm EDT
just sayin

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 2:24pm EDT
i'm citing this whole thing in chicago style

Steph DudakSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 2:24pm EDT
much nicer than MLA

Nick DevlinSaturday, April 13, 2013 at 2:27pm EDT
fancy


Steph Dudak: 67
Nick Devlin: 74
