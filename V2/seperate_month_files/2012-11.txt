Nick DevlinSaturday, November 10, 2012 at 8:17pm EST
probly really busy

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 10, 2012 at 8:17pm EST
but if you get some spare time

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 10, 2012 at 8:17pm EST
A small rush of accomplishment goes through me as I am able to grab all the clothes out of the dryer in one armful. I feel a small piece of cloth at my fingertips start slipping and my triumphant moment vanishes as it slides out of my grasp. I groan and reach in to grab the sock that fell back into the dryer. As I pick it up, I take a closer look at the sock and become even more exasperated. “MOOM! Did you go clothes shopping?!” praying that she would say yes. “No, honey. Why? Did you find another sock?” my mom answered from the other room. “Yes! It doesn’t even look close to like something we’d wear! ” “Stop being so dramatic, just put it with the rest.” “Fine,” I sigh, walking over to the sock room. There must be thousands of socks in shoddily organized piles. Why does Mom hoard them away in this room? None of them even fit on our feet, let alone match each other. I just fling in the sock into the room and shut the door behind me. Sometimes I really wish our socks just magically disappeared.

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 10, 2012 at 8:17pm EST
any stupid checking or advice you have would be awesome

Steph DudakSaturday, November 10, 2012 at 9:17pm EST
AH DID NOT SEE READING NAO

Steph DudakSaturday, November 10, 2012 at 9:19pm EST
Can you make MOOM MOM instead? was that on purpose? If it was I just read it as "moom". ' close to like something' sounds awkward to me, personally don't need like in there sounds good nigga i dig it

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 10, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
awesome thank you

Nick DevlinSaturday, November 10, 2012 at 10:18pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 5:33pm EST
so. many. references.

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 5:33pm EST
it was painful. I want to buy the movie then watch it frame by frame

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 5:33pm EST
just to make sure i get them all

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 5:34pm EST
I think the konami code was my favourite

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 5:36pm EST
puns on puns too I WISH EGGMAN TALKED THOUGH IN THEIR LITTLE MEETING IK IT WASNT THAT SIGNIFICANT BUT FOR SOME REASON I JUST REALLY WANTED HIM TO TALK

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 5:36pm EST
oh the puns were wonderful

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 5:36pm EST
but yeah bowser didnt talk either

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 5:37pm EST
bowser never really actually talks though but at least he did something

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 5:37pm EST
true, i guess eggman didnt get much since sonic got to give the death outside of game speech

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 5:37pm EST
i'm glad the main focus wasn't on the cameos but it would've been fun if they were a little more involved Exactly! It was such a good movie though

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 5:38pm EST
ALTHOUGH i didn't feel like whole felix/calhoun romance was completely necessary

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 5:38pm EST
it was amusing

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 5:38pm EST
and it didnt take away from the plot

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 5:39pm EST
so i didnt mind

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 5:39pm EST
no it didn't but it felt a little rushed and could've gone without it not saying it's a bad thing they included it

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 5:40pm EST
super rushed, the laughing taffy scene was hilarious

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 5:40pm EST
and her character just amused me in general

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 5:44pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:38pm EST
extreme lack of interest

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:38pm EST
i don't want to do collages

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:38pm EST
1 because i hate morna

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:38pm EST
2 because i hate collages

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:39pm EST
3 because i know she'll hate them either way

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:40pm EST
i make all my projects stuff I either already know about therefore can finsih in like ten minutes or stuff I really wanna know about and will look up even if I wasnt in class

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:40pm EST
i'm guessing there no way to do that for your project though

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:41pm EST
okay i have three collages. one i need to use stupid leaves and paper because that was class the other two have to relate to each other

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:41pm EST
i also have 0 magazines at hand or anything fun like that sooooooooooooooooooooooo

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:42pm EST
annoying

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:42pm EST
just go to a doctors office and steal some

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:42pm EST
yeah brb let me go do that

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:42pm EST
everyone has phones now anyway

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:42pm EST
glad to help :)

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:42pm EST
-.-

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:43pm EST
yeah idk

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:43pm EST
printing offline?

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:43pm EST
need to go to library and can only print black and white

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:43pm EST
because color costs money and i have none of that

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:44pm EST
maybe you could be all artsy and make the collage black and white

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:44pm EST
to show how imaginitive you is

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:44pm EST
she'll hate and tell me the composition is bad and then ask me why everything is black and white

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:44pm EST
true

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:45pm EST
she basically told amy the other day "YELLOW HURTS YOUR EYES YOU ARE BAD"

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:45pm EST
she had this yellow in her collage with the leaves, and it wouldn't hurt any normal persons eyes and morna was like

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:45pm EST
doesnt that hurt your eyes

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:45pm EST
and amy's like no

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:45pm EST
...

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:45pm EST
and mornas like YES IT DOES

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:45pm EST
and cAUSE UR OLD AS SHIT AND BLIND AS A BAT SHUT UP

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:46pm EST
THATS WHY IT HURTS YOUR EYES JUST QUIT TEACHING BC YOU SUCK

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:46pm EST
so youre saying she'll hate it no matter what you do

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:46pm EST
why not just do black and white then

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:46pm EST
or does the degree in which she hates it matter

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:49pm EST
it does cause i want it to look good I don't care what she wants necessarily, like i don't want to do black and white because i wouldn't like it myself. boring. i like color. i actually liked the last collage i did and i'm pretty sure she hated it with a passion But i'm at the point where i'm doing what i want because no matter what i do i'm going to get a not so desirable grade on it

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:49pm EST
thats good

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:49pm EST
I'm glad you are doing that

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:49pm EST
How did you do the last collage?

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:50pm EST
it was like 98% things i made hold on let me try to send you a picture

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:50pm EST
i was wondering if you were allowed to do that

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:50pm EST
just makes a bunch of your own pics to use

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:52pm EST
it was also partially because no magazines so yolo but i had previous art things i was able to use but see now these two collages need to relate to each other and idk what to do

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:52pm EST
relate how? like design-wise or concept wise

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:53pm EST
idk that's all she said

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:54pm EST
So like 2 different collages about penguins with different styles could work?

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:54pm EST
that'd be amusing

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:54pm EST
yes lol but i'm not jewels

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:54pm EST
first thing that came to mind

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:54pm EST
do a collage of shoes

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:54pm EST
with a fox in the corner

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:54pm EST
hahaha

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:55pm EST
then the second collage is just rich's face everywhere

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:55pm EST
oh my goodness

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:55pm EST
and the relate because they both are parts of the story

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:55pm EST
the wonderful beautiful story

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:56pm EST
that would be something

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:57pm EST
it would be awesome

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:57pm EST
or you could do like a before and after

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:57pm EST
since i just thought of seaside

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:57pm EST
pictures from before collage

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:57pm EST
pictures after collage

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 6:58pm EST
itd be sad, but it could work if you could find pics

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:08pm EST
i don't have time for that

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:08pm EST
because i'd need to go over to the library and print them and theyd be black and white

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:08pm EST

OKAY TIME TO DO MY PAPER AND I CAN COLLAGE WHILE SKYPING UGH

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:12pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:13pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:15pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:16pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:17pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:40pm EST
Graffiti is an art form used to express culture, emotion, and politics. While graffiti is often seen as a nuisance, messy, or useless, it invokes specific feelings in people which is exactly what art does. or something like that, any input to fix that is fine too but the quote: “Art is anything you can get away with.”

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:41pm EST
hmmm

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:41pm EST
gimme a sec

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:41pm EST
or a min

you're perfect

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:47pm EST
np

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:47pm EST
i like editing

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:48pm EST
alright so after that

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:48pm EST
i had a plan to introduce traditional definition of graffiti then came in banksy cause how can i write a paper about graffiti and not mention banksy

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:49pm EST
that is true

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:49pm EST
however

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:49pm EST
the bulk of this paper has to be about graffiti and philadelphia

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:49pm EST
now

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:49pm EST
the good thing is, i do have this little bit of information in a separate paragraph

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:49pm EST
The birthplace of graffiti in the United States is said to have been in Philadelphia in the 1960s. Well known in Philadelphia is Cornbread, born Darryl McCray, who is often referred to as “the father of modern graffiti writing” and refers to himself as a graffiti writer. He is mostly known for signing “Cornbread” in various places including the Jackson 5’s private jet and on an elephant in the Philadelphia Zoo. *INSERT MORE INFORMATION AND STUFF HERE BEFORE TRANSITIONING INTO NEXT* But graffiti in Philadelphia has since developed and grown and the city is now filled with “traditional” graffiti to beautiful large scale murals.

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:51pm EST
but i do feel like i'm kind of contradicting myself

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:51pm EST
cause i want to make the argument more graffiti has grown into art from these scribbles and such

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:51pm EST
but they are the basis for it

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:52pm EST
hmm

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:52pm EST
relate the growth of graffiti to another art form

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:52pm EST
that was once possibly seen as silly

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:52pm EST
into something that is respected

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:53pm EST
maybe animation?

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:53pm EST
or something else?

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:53pm EST
i'm not too into art histyory but there must be something

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:55pm EST
well i mean i can still do that without comparing it but i can do that too cause its like writing>more complex "writing" such as http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_jiLsBLaOvzE/S-ZnJu1PhzI/AAAAAAAAG9Y/x7eoi8MKAmc/s1600/ABC+alphabet+graffiti+style+cool.jpg to then pictures to then murals bc philadelphia and hella murals

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:56pm EST
that is true

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:56pm EST
and the murals i mean they have tours of those and theyre used as educational things

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:57pm EST
hmm so which part do you think is contradictory

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:59pm EST
hm well I dont know because i dont really consider just signing your name somewhere with spraypaint art but it helped develop what ugh how do i write i'm going to send you everything i have written right now. it's not much and it's all over the place

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 7:59pm EST
and i dont think in order either idk which to talk about first but i feel like banksy and then philly idk anyway

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:00pm EST
using your intro; Graffiti is an art form that can be used to express culture, emotion, and political views. While graffiti is often seen as a nuisance, ugly, or even offensive, it does invoke feelings in people, which is exactly what art does. Andy Warhol, a pioneer in unconventional art, has said that “Art is anything you can get away with.” Graffiti is usually defined as writings or drawings scribbled or spray painted illicitly onto a wall or other surfaces in public areas which is why it is usually seen as nothing more than vandalism. The artists creating the graffiti are often associated with gangs, violence, or bad neighborhoods. However, this is a common misconception of graffiti artists. In fact, only a small portion of graffiti is done by gangs and such is strictly used for marking terrain—it has no style and is not meant to put forth anything else. So how can one possibly consider graffiti art? A good example is the British graffiti artist, or street artist, Banksy. He started off in England by writing and stenciling around various places and has since had multiple solo gallery shows and published five books of his art and writing. Banksy is a prime example of how graffiti can be much more than something scribbled onto a wall. Much of his work is satirical and involves political or social commentary often stenciled onto walls. One of his works, “Girl with Heart Balloon” features a little girl next to a heart shaped red balloon that appears to be floating away from her. While it may have an apparent meaning, it can be interpreted in a variety of ways. One of the more literal meanings would be she is letting her heart go, while another may be she is reaching to get back something that has fallen from her grasp. Another work, “The Crayola Shooter” depicts a young boy holding a machine gun with crayons as the ammunition surrounded by flowers, grass, and a sun with a smiley face—something it seems a little kid would create. A third work of his, simple text on a wall that reads “Sorry! The lifestyle you ordered is out currently of stock”, seems to be a sarcastic comment on consumer culture. While Banksy is one of the more famous graffiti artists and does make specific commentary through his pieces, the same ideals are used by other graffiti artists in other places such as Philadelphia. The birthplace of graffiti in the United States is said to have been in Philadelphia in the 1960s. Well known in Philadelphia is Cornbread, born Darryl McCray, who is often referred to as “the father of modern graffiti writing” and refers to himself as a graffiti writer. He is mostly known for signing “Cornbread” in various places including the Jackson 5’s private jet and on an elephant in the Philadelphia Zoo. *INSERT MORE INFORMATION AND STUFF HERE BEFORE TRANSITIONING INTO NEXT* But graffiti in Philadelphia has since developed and grown and the city is now filled with “traditional” graffiti to beautiful large scale murals.

I am reading

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:02pm EST
If you are just waiting for me to go over you can entertain yourself by stupid checking my first paragrapg :D

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:02pm EST
Dragon. When people hear that word what is the first thing that comes to mind? Depending on where you live or what you know the answer could be very different. In Asian countries the Chinese Dragon may first pop into someone’s mind; the long, curvy, serpentine animal that appears so often. However in western culture the monstrous, fire-breathing European Dragon is more widely recognized. Dragons have been a prevalent mythical creature for centuries, perhaps millennia, and they are still popular today, showing up in books like Harry Potter, the Lord of the Rings, and The Dragonriders of Pern. It might stand out that all of these popular stories contain allusions to European dragons, which makes sense as they were all written by Western authors. However it is plain to see by some of the festivals, architecture, and designs in Asian countries that the Chinese dragon is still popular today.

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
if you're going to use second person in the third sentence, i'd use it in the second as well it'll flow nicer. "When YOU hear that word what is the first thing that comes to mind? Depending on where you live or what you know the answer could be very different." does western always need to be capitalized? if so, capitalize "However in Western culture etc" if not, ignore

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
it always should be capitilized yeah

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:11pm EST
I think you talk about bansky a bit much

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:11pm EST
it doesnt relate to philly much

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:11pm EST
that's just cause i have no other information yet lol

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:11pm EST
gotcha

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:11pm EST
that was just the easiest to write about

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:11pm EST
i'd say try to find philly art work to disect if you can

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
cause i have the beginnings of the beginning of graffiti in philadelphia yeah that's what imma try now bc i tried looking for specific artists but nope

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
yeah I gotchu

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:13pm EST
you could be a super cool tryhard and go out and find a cool mural, take a pic and include in the essay then explain its meaning

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:14pm EST
i probably wouldn't need to actually go out to find one but i think he may have suggested that at our meaning I really shouldve written down what we discussed because it was thursday and i had gotten no sleep and still had design on my brain all day

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:14pm EST
meeting*

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:16pm EST
usually helpful to write things

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:16pm EST
here is what i fixed

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:16pm EST
Graffiti is an art form that can be used to express culture, emotion, and political views. While graffiti is often seen as a nuisance, ugly, or even offensive, it does invoke feelings in people, which is exactly what art does. Andy Warhol, a pioneer in unconventional art, has said that “Art is anything you can get away with.” Graffiti is usually defined as markings scribbled or spray-painted illegally onto a wall or other surface in public areas, which is why it is usually seen as nothing more than vandalism. The artists creating the graffiti are associated with gangs, violence, and bad neighborhoods. However, this is a common misconception of graffiti artists. In fact, only a small portion of graffiti is done by gangs and it is strictly used for marking terrain—it has no style and is not meant to be artistic. So how could one possibly consider graffiti as a legitimate art form? A good example is the British graffiti artist, or street artist, Banksy. He started off in England by writing and stenciling *what* around *various places* (where?) and has had many solo gallery to display his works. He has also published five books of his art and writings. Banksy is a prime example of how graffiti can be much more than something scribbled onto a wall. Much of his graffiti work is satirical and involves political or social commentary. One of his works, “Girl with Heart Balloon”, features a little girl next to a heart shaped red balloon that appears to be floating away from her. While it may have an apparent meaning, it can be interpreted in a variety of ways. One of the more literal meanings would be she is letting her heart go, while another may be she is reaching to get back something that has fallen from her grasp.

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:20pm EST
can i ask why you changed illicitly to illegally

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:21pm EST
different connotation

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:21pm EST
didnt seem to match your tone to me

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:21pm EST
i could be wrong

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:21pm EST
its just a personal preference

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:35pm EST
well now i have an issue

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:36pm EST
unfun

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:36pm EST
http://muralarts.org/about/history The Anti-Graffiti Network hired muralist Jane Golden to reach out to graffiti writers and to redirect their energies from destructive graffiti writing to constructive mural painting.

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:39pm EST
the issue is

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:40pm EST
i dont think there is one But ii need to be more specific

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:41pm EST
specific is usually better than general

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:42pm EST
i mean i'm making the argument that graffiti is art okay but scribbles isn't necessarily art

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:42pm EST
but it has grown from that scribbles>hard as fuck to do writing>pictures>murals examples of all

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:43pm EST
mural arts program developed to rid the city of destructive graffiti, helping artists channel their creativity and skill into something larger more impacting and beautiful

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:43pm EST
thus mofukkin murals out the ass

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:43pm EST
thus defining factor of philadelphia

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:43pm EST
as "city of murals"

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:44pm EST
inspiring people and artists of many kinds

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:44pm EST
yes

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:44pm EST
seems logical to me

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:45pm EST
alright but then i have that intro

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:46pm EST
Graffiti is an art form that can be used to express culture, emotion, and political views. [[While graffiti is often seen as a nuisance, ugly, or even offensive, it does invoke feelings in people, which is exactly what art does. Andy Warhol, a pioneer in unconventional art, has said that “Art is anything you can get away with.”]] that goes for ALL graffiti but i'm not considering ALL graffiti art (scribbles) omg what am i doing

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
all right, your problem is defining exactly what constitutes graffiti art

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
you cannot exclude the tagging of names and 'scribbles'

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
that is the foundation of graffiti

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
it may not be good

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
it may not be appreciated

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
but it is still ary

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
art*

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:48pm EST
true then the next problem comes into this sentence or few Graffiti is usually defined as markings scribbled or spray-painted illegally onto a wall or other surface in public areas, which is why it is usually seen as nothing more than vandalism. The people creating the graffiti are associated with gangs, violence, and bad neighborhoods. However, this is a common misconception of graffiti artists. In fact, only a small portion of graffiti is done by gangs and it is strictly used for marking terrain—it has no style and is not meant to be artistic.

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:49pm EST
scribbles

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:51pm EST
Although this portion of the art form may be obtrusive and unwelcome, it is not all that graffiti has to offer

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:51pm EST
just like all things it has its negative users, which should be used to stereotype the art itself

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:52pm EST
kjGSkfg thank you for helping me

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:53pm EST
of course

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:54pm EST
okay now to find more complex writing pieces to transition out of Cornbread i wish i could find a specific artists

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:54pm EST
-s why can't i type lately oh my goodness

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:55pm EST
well graffiti is sort of anonymous isnt it?

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:55pm EST
i mean most people use pseudonyms

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:56pm EST
the artists are very imprtant so it 'd be better just to find famous works

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:56pm EST
arent*

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:56pm EST
no i know but it makes it easier to reference them

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:56pm EST
true

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:56pm EST
like with banksy actual art

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:56pm EST
na mean

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:56pm EST
I know, but it would be good to show something anyone would assume at firs tglance isnt art

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:57pm EST
then explain why it is

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:57pm EST
hm. i should've asked him if i'm allowed to include pictures in this paper

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:57pm EST
i don't see why i wouldn't be

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:57pm EST
i could have a reference sheet

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:57pm EST
to the picture so it's not right in the essay

Steph DudakSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:57pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, November 18, 2012 at 8:57pm EST

it's probably real bad writing since went back to workin on it late

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 1:57pm EST
tis fine

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 1:57pm EST
While Banksy is one of the more famous graffiti artists and does make specific commentary through his pieces, the same ideals are used by other graffiti artists in other places such as Philadelphia.

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 1:57pm EST
you sound like you are about to contradict something

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 1:57pm EST
then dont

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 1:57pm EST
i shouldnt say while

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 1:57pm EST
basically

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 1:58pm EST
after pieces put and in philadelphia take out other places such as

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 1:58pm EST
since philly is the main focus

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 1:58pm EST
see ya dont even need me

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 1:58pm EST
yes i do pls read the rest lol

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 1:59pm EST
While it can be easy to make out what it says, sometimes it is more difficult and leaves the viewer looking at it longer in an attempt to decipher what the painting really means.

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 1:59pm EST
While it can *occasionally* be

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:00pm EST
i feel like this section doesn't have enough real information

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:00pm EST
but i need to then transition from all that into the murals

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:00pm EST
hmm

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:02pm EST
the last paragraph is missing

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:02pm EST
also this sentence

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:02pm EST
Or perhaps all of these questions are invalid, which can be applied to any work of art.

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:02pm EST
is not useful and can be cut

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:02pm EST
or you need to better explain the idea

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:02pm EST
word

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:02pm EST
Not only are they interesting but they make comments and meanings and ideas can be pulled out of them just by looking at them. and the city is now filled with everything from “traditional” graffiti to beautiful large-scale murals.

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:03pm EST
this is what is going on in my word document

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:03pm EST
yep

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:03pm EST
ah you wish to fill that space?

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:03pm EST
that's unfinished stuff that is a sentence i had in there that i mightve wanted to keep not sure

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:03pm EST
but yes that space does need to be filled some more

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:04pm EST
gotcha

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:05pm EST
but overall its cool

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:05pm EST
the bansky stuff doesnt seem as much now that you have added a little to the overall stuff

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:05pm EST
have you googled random philly murals yet?

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:05pm EST
i have a website

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:05pm EST
hold on

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:05pm EST
awesome

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:06pm EST
http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1649278,00.html#ixzz2Cczt47kb

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:06pm EST
i just need to find a way to transition into the murals cause i do need to talk about the mural arts program thing

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:06pm EST
i think that bottom sentence is gonna be part of my closing

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:06pm EST
im just not sure if i have enough about all the other stuff i have in there rn

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:08pm EST
move you last sentence

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:08pm EST
Not only are they interesting but they make comments and meanings and ideas can be pulled out of them just by looking at them.

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:08pm EST
to your second to last sentence

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:08pm EST
and then you have a fine transition into murals

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:12pm EST
only thing is

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:12pm EST
i used that second to last sentence to talk about like like the example i have to the left

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:12pm EST
not quite mural yet

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:12pm EST
but not just writing graffiti

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:12pm EST
which is how you transition from griffiti to mural...?

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:13pm EST
the in between stage

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:13pm EST
what i'm saying is

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:16pm EST
Thus throughout the years graffiti continued to develop and we begin to see actual images in works of graffiti. Not only are they interesting but they make comments and meanings and ideas can be pulled out of them just by looking at them that is about the inbetween. like it's about that example on the left. it's not really a mural right now, but it's not just writing graffiti. it's grown into that and from there murals. but i guess icould still get away with switching those last two sentences

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:17pm EST
that is what i am saying. The two ideas are connected but the first idea of including pictures transitions well into introducing the ide of murals

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:18pm EST
got it

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:18pm EST
alright

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:18pm EST
so

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:18pm EST
well then i need to talk about the mural arts program thing

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:18pm EST
so i have those two sentences

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:18pm EST
new paragraph

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:19pm EST
yup

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:19pm EST
because of the amount of graffiti

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:20pm EST
large amount of graffiti

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:20pm EST
as well as destructive graffiti writing

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:21pm EST
http://muralarts.org/about/history the mural arts program began as an attempt to redirect the abilities of graffiti artists into constructive mural painting

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:24pm EST
so

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:24pm EST
people who disliked the problem of grafitti noticed the potential it had to be pretty

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:24pm EST
based on some of the more artistic scribblings

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:24pm EST
and thus tried to create a solution with that

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:26pm EST
essentially

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:27pm EST
Because of the large amount of graffiti around Philadelphia, the Mural Arts Program was established as an attempt to redirect the creative abilities of graffiti artists from what they believed was destructive into constructive mural painting. It was obvious that these people had immense creative talent and the program was a way to make that into something bigger that also adds to communities and the city of Philadelphia as a whole. The creation of these murals changed lives as well as helped bring beauty and life to the city. Over 3,000 murals have been produced since the program began, giving Philadelphia the title of “City of Murals”.

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:28pm EST
bam

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:28pm EST
just clean up some sentences and it sounds awesome to me

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:29pm EST
okay also

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:29pm EST
i have a specific mural to add into that

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:29pm EST
cause the whole changing lives thing

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:29pm EST
and a quote

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:29pm EST

http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1649278_1421197,00.html Hopefully that takes you to it

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:30pm EST

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:30pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:33pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:33pm EST
okay

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:33pm EST
so

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:34pm EST
picture has been included too bad i can't print in color ): Because of the large amount of graffiti around Philadelphia, the Mural Arts Program was established as an attempt to redirect the creative abilities of graffiti artists from what they believed was destructive into constructive mural painting. It was obvious that these people had immense creative talent and the program was a way to make that into something bigger that also adds to communities and the city of Philadelphia as a whole. The creation of these murals changed lives as well as helped bring beauty and life to the city. Over 3,000 murals have been produced since the program began, giving Philadelphia the title of “City of Murals”. One mural entitled “Reaching for a Star” by Don Gensler is featured on the side of a house. A resident, William Hodges, comments on the mural saying “That mural is the best thing that’s happened around here. For 20 years, this neighborhood’s been going down, but when they came and put that mural up there on the wall, it stopped it from going down” showing how truly impacting these murals are. help cleaning ?? AND THEN CONCLUSION!!??

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:35pm EST
alright cleaning first

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:35pm EST
then hopefully we'll think of a conclusion by the time we're done

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:36pm EST
Because of the large amount of graffiti around Philadelphia

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:36pm EST
Say some sentence that shows there is a lot of grafitti not that tells you

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:37pm EST
Since this is a research paper instead of flowery language

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:37pm EST
you should use

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:37pm EST
a fact or somethings

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:37pm EST
Due to graffiti coverering x amount of public grounds

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:38pm EST
true i will admit i was taking it from this The Mural Arts Program began in 1984 as a component of the Philadelphia Anti-Graffiti Network, an effort spearheaded by then Mayor Wilson Goode to eradicate the graffiti crisis plaguing the city. The Anti-Graffiti Network hired muralist Jane Golden to reach out to graffiti writers and to redirect their energies from destructive graffiti writing to constructive mural painting.

Nick DevlinMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:38pm EST
thats fine, you are paraphrasing

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:41pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, November 19, 2012 at 2:42pm EST

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 9:56pm EST
at one part

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 9:56pm EST
UGH OKAY SO I THINK MY LIGHT PROJECT IS TOO SIMPLE

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 9:57pm EST
:/

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 9:57pm EST
http://origamiaday.wordpress.com/2011/12/24/sea-urchin-star/ it's essentially this but with punctures

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 9:57pm EST
in it

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 9:57pm EST
thats hmmm cool

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 9:57pm EST
and the way it's made, there are little triangles of spaces at the bottom of each piece on the inside that i was CONSIDERING covering with like colored cellophane but idk BUT I THINK THIS IS TOO SIMPLE OF A THING

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 9:58pm EST
the one thing is it'll make some cool shadows

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 9:58pm EST
I always thought simple was better

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 9:58pm EST
for design

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 9:58pm EST
wrong

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 9:58pm EST
lol

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 9:58pm EST
well not necessarily wrong

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 9:58pm EST
more like

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 9:58pm EST
not always?

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 9:58pm EST
i need to compare myself to other students and there will be more complex ones that if they work I get a B on my project

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 9:58pm EST
because it's seen as "playing it safe"

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 9:59pm EST
which i think is ridiculous. NOT WHAT IM TRYING TO DO WITH THIS I JUST WANT TO DO SOMETHING GEOMETRICAL

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 9:59pm EST
playing it safe?

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 9:59pm EST
hmmm

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 9:59pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 9:59pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:06pm EST
i would love to have a result similar to this but maybe when the object is turned, there's a different effect

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:06pm EST
its like the twilight turtle i gave sara

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
making the holes into actual designs might help?

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
aw cute!

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
or are you already doing that

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
well that's the thing idk about that

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
but

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
i was considering different shapes

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
mhm

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
like triangles and things

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:08pm EST
that could help

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
different shapes on differnt things

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
when you turn it

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
thats cool

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
sometimes triangles sometimes other things

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
i just dont want it to look cheesy

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
like i dont want it to look like a nightlight

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
do you know how to make the light not be all blurry?

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
what do you mean

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
like how far the shade needs to be from the source

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
if it is too close the light will blur

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
and there will be no design

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
too far and the same problem hapens

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
well the only issue

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
is

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
the light is going to be inside that shape

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
WHICH IS ANOTHER THING

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
I FEEL LIKE ITLL BE A FIRE HAZARD

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
what kind of bulb?

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
for my study model, i dont think we need to use a light, but im putting those little fake tealights in it

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
just because i have them off hand

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
idk yet!

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
almost all bulbs nowadays arent fire hazards

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:12pm EST
expecially the twisty ones

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:12pm EST
the eco friendly things

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:12pm EST
well i mean

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:12pm EST
because paper is around it

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:12pm EST
the thing is made of paper

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:13pm EST
the spontaneous combustion threshhold is from like 400-500 degrees fahrenheit

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:13pm EST
O think you are fine

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:13pm EST
no lightbulb will heat the paper enough to cause a problem

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:13pm EST
and if something else makes a fire

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:13pm EST
well it doesnt really matter what the shade is made of

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:14pm EST
you have bigger problems

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:14pm EST
gotchu

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:14pm EST
so

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:14pm EST
but 3 inches away from the bulb

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:14pm EST
is good

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:14pm EST
yeah im just trynna think of how i can execute this without her being "lol simple"

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:15pm EST
i like the idea of cool paper thing that seems simple

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:15pm EST
but creates complex shadow design

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:15pm EST
THATS ANOTHER THING OKAY

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:15pm EST
but i am not her

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:15pm EST
cause

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:15pm EST
she was like

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:15pm EST
think about

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:15pm EST
what if it looks different when lights are on than when the lights are off

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:15pm EST
thats why im trynna think of how i make these ~punctures

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:16pm EST
i'm not sure i understand

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:17pm EST
i dont want giant obvious holes

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:17pm EST
i understand that

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
THATS witjaegj

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
okay

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
okay I WANT TO TRY the cellopahne thing

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
cellophane

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
i was gonna ask that next

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
i dont have any cellophane but i have plastic i can color and tape in the inside

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
it works for a study model i attempted it already

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:19pm EST
you could just like use sharpie on some scotch tape

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:19pm EST
ghetto arts and crafts

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:19pm EST
i dont have any transparent scotch tape though

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:19pm EST
that does sound problematic

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:19pm EST
but i was just joking

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
i was gonna use the plastic bag they put my bristol in at the school store lol

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
its even more ghetto actually

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
yeah coloring the lights sounds cool

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
all stretchy and shit

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
SHOULD I DO MORE THAN ONE COLOR

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
RED ORANGE AND YELLOW

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
youd have to test

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
i would

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
just to make sure they dont look awful

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
exactly

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
i dont wanna over do it

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
but i like warm colors like that

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
and make it ratchet

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
same

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
thats why

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
we'll see

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:21pm EST
i feel like blues and greens are way too difficult

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:21pm EST
like they would barely be visible

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:21pm EST
so yeah yellows and reds

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:21pm EST
imma test them too

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:21pm EST
though

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:21pm EST
cause im using white paper

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:21pm EST
who knows, might look awesome

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:21pm EST
do some rainbow shit

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:22pm EST
its be awesome if you had access to prisms

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:22pm EST
the only problem would be the light source would have to be very specific

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:22pm EST
i considered that

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:22pm EST
only works with white light

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:22pm EST
when i had to think of ideas

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:22pm EST
because

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:22pm EST
hol don

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:22pm EST
hold *

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:22pm EST
on

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:22pm EST
hol donning

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:23pm EST
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9bixwUdeo1ra5qn3o1_500.jpg

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:23pm EST
i was thinking of stuff like that

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:23pm EST
then i thought of multiple prisms

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:23pm EST
and mirrors

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:23pm EST
0.o shit that pic was awesome

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:24pm EST
i have no clue how youd integrate them into the piece

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:24pm EST
but it sounds cool

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:24pm EST
the only problem with that is i don't know what i would've wanted the shadow to be yeah idk then i was considering

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:24pm EST
making this shape

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:24pm EST
with some sort of plexi and then i was thinking

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:24pm EST
what would happen if there were like mirrors inside it

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:24pm EST
would anything happen if that

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:24pm EST
id have no way of testing

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:25pm EST
that would take a lot of fidgeting

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:25pm EST
finessing

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:25pm EST
wahtever

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:26pm EST
anyways

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:29pm EST
itd probably be helpful

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:29pm EST
if i had like

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:29pm EST
origami paper

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:29pm EST
but of course i didnt try to invest in any over the break

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:30pm EST
i doubt thatd be a priority when getting supplies

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:31pm EST
itd have been helpful

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:31pm EST
that it would

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:32pm EST
6/30 pieces of paper cut out

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:32pm EST
24 to go

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:32pm EST
thats like 20%!

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:32pm EST
you got this

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:34pm EST
also would be easier to fold i think since it's kind of made for that kinda thing

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:34pm EST
hopefully i can flawlessly make this work though lolol

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:35pm EST
origami paper is known for folding i suppose

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:37pm EST
yeah currently using printer paper lol

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:38pm EST
not as bad as it could be

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:38pm EST
just use a pencil or straightedge or something to crease and you'll be fine

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:38pm EST
my points arent pointy

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
:/

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
hmm

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
put something on the tips

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
it will make the thing more complex

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:40pm EST
and cover up the nonpointy tips

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:41pm EST
i have to fold on the diagonal of a rectangle

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:42pm EST
what do you mean

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
like this sorta

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
but better obviously

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
put a shape on the tips

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
that will have smoother lines

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
and doesnt look stupid

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
i just picked some random shapes

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
it was just an idea

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
the second one i folded came out better

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
good

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:47pm EST
28 more of those to go! lol

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:47pm EST
my brother and sister make me so mad

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:47pm EST
i knew something was missing from my task bar

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:47pm EST
idk why when they use my computer they feel the need to rearrange things

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:48pm EST
wow

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:48pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:48pm EST
somehow skype managed to vanish

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
that doesnt even make sense

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
stupid sibling

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
thats what i get for being a nice sister and letting them play wow

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:49pm EST

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
I think i could get my sister addicted to minecraft

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
but i decided not to

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
because shed constantly be pestering me with questions

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 10:51pm EST
exactly

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 11:16pm EST

you can draw like josh in the corner as kirby or something

Nick DevlinMonday, November 26, 2012 at 11:23pm EST
the possibilities are endless

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 11:23pm EST
the only thing is i'd need to practice a little bit because i can't draw people of course video game characters are a bit different but still difficult a little bit

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 11:24pm EST
ehe i could use melee or double dash

Steph DudakMonday, November 26, 2012 at 11:24pm EST

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:29pm EST
i shall put it in my list of things

Steph DudakTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:29pm EST
they got all kinds of stuff

Steph DudakTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:29pm EST
itd look nice if you mitered the edges haha

Steph DudakTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:30pm EST
dunno if youd be able to

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:30pm EST
like when i join the wood

Steph DudakTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:30pm EST
yes

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:30pm EST
i should be able to

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:31pm EST
i was thinking a lot about how to join

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:31pm EST
the wood together

Steph DudakTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:31pm EST
mitering will be good, and it'll look nice. also if you can find loctite anywhere, it's a certain glue. the control gel is real awesome holds wood together pretty well

Steph DudakTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:31pm EST
otherwise you know. wood glue and shit

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:32pm EST
hmmm

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:33pm EST
this is mitering right>?

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:33pm EST
angling the edges of wood

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:33pm EST
so they fit nice

Steph DudakTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:33pm EST
yep!

Steph DudakTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:33pm EST
45 degree angles

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:34pm EST
well they couldnt be 45

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:34pm EST
otherwise they wouldnt fit together

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:34pm EST
but yeah

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:34pm EST
that is what i thought

Steph DudakTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:34pm EST
yeah they would

Steph DudakTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:35pm EST
why wouldnt they fit

Steph DudakTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:35pm EST
oh

Steph DudakTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:35pm EST
would it not make that shape then

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:35pm EST
yeah

Steph DudakTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:35pm EST
yeah derp

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:35pm EST
45 degrees makes a box

Steph DudakTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:35pm EST
well you know

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:35pm EST
i know

Steph DudakTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:35pm EST
you're smart you'll figure it out

Steph DudakTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:36pm EST
wait

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:36pm EST
already trying, I wish I had a writing utensil, i need to draw this stuff out without a computer

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:36pm EST
waiting

Steph DudakTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:36pm EST
your thing is drawn with 45 degree angles tho ?

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:36pm EST
nope

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:36pm EST
i tried 45 it looked odd

Steph DudakTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:36pm EST
merh

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:38pm EST
actually

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:38pm EST
its not that bad

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:38pm EST
and it would make life much easier

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:38pm EST
especially with calculations

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:39pm EST
fuck it, i'm making a ton of 90 and 135 angles

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:40pm EST
holy shit look how awesome this is

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:40pm EST
http://www.woodworkingtips.com/etips/etip010511sn.html

Steph DudakTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:43pm EST
that is awesome

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:46pm EST
so many ideas

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:46pm EST
it wouldnt really help much for my project though

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:47pm EST
the mitered area is too small

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:47pm EST
it'd be like 1/4 of an inch

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:47pm EST
maybe 1/2

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:47pm EST
aither way

Steph DudakTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:48pm EST
what do you mean

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:49pm EST
the area where the boards connect

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:49pm EST
is too small for a spline to be worth it

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 12:50pm EST
a might just end up sawing all the way through

Steph DudakTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 8:16pm EST

Steph DudakTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 8:17pm EST
there's a new plan for my design project no clue how im going to do it

Steph DudakTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 8:17pm EST
i cannot do this star because it has 20 points and i need to like carve it into cardboard essentially

Steph DudakTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 8:17pm EST
and its too much

Nick DevlinTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 8:18pm EST
mhmm

Steph DudakTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 8:18pm EST
then i found like a 12 pointed star but its not as 3s

Steph DudakTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 8:18pm EST
3d

Steph DudakTuesday, November 27, 2012 at 8:18pm EST
can you get on skype so i can show you

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 3:22pm EST
gotcha

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 3:22pm EST
5 came a lot sooner than i though

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 3:23pm EST
thought*

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 3:25pm EST
I'm in class lol

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 3:25pm EST
Didn't start yet though

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 3:27pm EST
Idk why I'm trying to do this There are lights like this in existence Why am I boring

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 3:30pm EST
you like to make cool things

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 3:30pm EST
and dont like

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 3:30pm EST
when the things you make arent awesome

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 3:30pm EST
so you dont make something purely from brain

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 3:30pm EST
cause who knows how it could turn out

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 3:30pm EST
it might suck

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 3:30pm EST
then youd have to do it all over

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 3:31pm EST
The problem is I don't even have straight brain ideas that could potentially be successful or a failure

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 3:31pm EST
you probly do

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 3:31pm EST
and just ignore them

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 3:32pm EST
If I did I'd be acting on them

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 3:32pm EST
:/

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 3:32pm EST
well im not sure how to help

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 3:32pm EST
i never have original ideas

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 3:32pm EST
i just google until i see enough things to mash together

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:06pm EST
I do have a problem With not letting things go

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:06pm EST
From like the moment I got this assignment I wanted to do something geometrical Which isn't necessarily a bad thing is it

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:06pm EST
That I wanted g d that

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:06pm EST
To do not g d

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:07pm EST
Idk

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:39pm EST
niiiiiiiiiiiick

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:53pm EST
soeryyryy

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:54pm EST
you said five

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:54pm EST
i got out a lot earlier than expectedlol

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:54pm EST
my writing teacher is as done as we are

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:54pm EST
i was explorating the art rooms

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:54pm EST
i really iwsh i had time/ money to take one

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:54pm EST
Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:54pm EST
anyywayyy

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:54pm EST
yes

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:54pm EST
shape

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:55pm EST
each point OKAY IF IT WOULDNT BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO DO

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:55pm EST
what i WANT

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:55pm EST
each pentagon point to be made out of plexi, or some sort of clear stuff. then on either end (you can see that in the grey) that would be frosted plexi

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:55pm EST
mkay

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:55pm EST
so it glows but no blinding light comin through it

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:56pm EST
and then the rest would obviously be like wood or something

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:56pm EST
opaque

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:56pm EST
AM I CORECT IN SAYING

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:56pm EST
correct *

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:56pm EST
that an equilateral triangle can be separated into three kites?

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:56pm EST
cause it looks like kites but im not sure

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:57pm EST
by kite do you mean quadrilateral with sequential congruent sides?

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:57pm EST
http://www.mathopenref.com/kite.html

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:57pm EST
lote

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:57pm EST
kite *

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:57pm EST
yes you do

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:58pm EST
so correct then im just trynna explain to her completely

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:59pm EST
yes you are correct

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 4:59pm EST
to obtuse angle of kite is like 120

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 5:00pm EST
the acute is 60

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 5:01pm EST
and the the congurent angles are 90

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 5:01pm EST
it all matches up

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 5:02pm EST
this is all 2d right?

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 5:02pm EST
what?

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 5:02pm EST
the shape?

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 5:02pm EST
the whole thing?

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 5:02pm EST
MY PROJECT

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 5:03pm EST
the equalateral triangle

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 5:03pm EST
that you ar easking about

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 5:03pm EST
with the kite thing

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 5:03pm EST
yes in relation to the icosahedron how i separated it

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 5:03pm EST
then yes

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 5:03pm EST
everything we stated above is correct

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 5:03pm EST
im trying to explain to betty and i didnt want to use the wrong quadrilateral name or something stoophid

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 5:04pm EST
the kites are made by drawing perpendicular lines from the midpoint of each side to the center of the triangle

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 5:04pm EST
youre all good

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 5:05pm EST
i've totally made this shape from magnets before

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 5:05pm EST
like a million times

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 5:33pm EST
whats your email

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 5:33pm EST
dravarian26@gmail.com

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 5:34pm EST
fwding the email to you that i sent betty

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 5:44pm EST
kk

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 5:46pm EST
geometry inception

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 5:46pm EST
dont hear that every day

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 6:14pm EST
lol ik

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 6:14pm EST
SHE SENT ME ONE SENTENCE BACK.

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 6:15pm EST
I like the idea of light accentuating edges and corners. Go for it.

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 6:18pm EST
would i have to build a frame for this?

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 6:18pm EST
or could i just make the shapes?

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 6:29pm EST
sorry

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 6:29pm EST
umm?

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 6:29pm EST
i mean a frame wouldnt hurt

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 6:29pm EST
except for timewise

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 6:30pm EST
and it might help with the whole craftsmenship thing, I mean since the light will penetrate the sides

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 6:30pm EST
a frame would help give more definition

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 6:53pm EST
i really need to eat

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 6:53pm EST
i forgot and now im all shaky -.-

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 6:53pm EST
Go eattttt

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 6:53pm EST
im cooking now

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 6:54pm EST
and since cooking will take too long

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 6:54pm EST
and i am annoyed by shaky hands

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 6:54pm EST
i am making ramen to eat while i cook

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 6:56pm EST
But what do I make the frame with The corners would be out of plexi I don't know if it'd look nice with a frame next to it

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 6:57pm EST
hmm

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 6:57pm EST
what materials are you thinking of?

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 6:57pm EST
Id asume the frame would need to be completely opaque

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 6:58pm EST
and that would gve it a slight wire frame appearance

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 6:58pm EST
Well ignoring frames then wood and plexi

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 6:59pm EST
hmm

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 6:59pm EST
if youre pressed for time id say avoid the frame

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 6:59pm EST
if you have the time make it

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:00pm EST
and use whatever is cheapest

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:00pm EST
you wont see the actual material of the frame will you?

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:00pm EST
It need to be done by next Thursday

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:00pm EST
idk how fast you make stuff

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:00pm EST
I don't know

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:00pm EST
I think she thought the red parts of my drawing were meant to b accentuated

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:01pm EST
But

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:01pm EST
Nah

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:01pm EST
Well actually

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:02pm EST
Did you read the email

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:02pm EST
yes

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:03pm EST
i did

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:04pm EST
um

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:04pm EST
okay

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:04pm EST
so i mentioned the whole shapes thing

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:04pm EST
but

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:04pm EST
will you be able to tell

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:04pm EST
i did

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:04pm EST
if

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:05pm EST
i dont know how to word

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:05pm EST
like see how lines separate every shape?

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:05pm EST
like what if that red thing was a frame, but wont be there. and imagine it without the black lines

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:05pm EST
will the shapes be defined?

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:06pm EST
how cause i mean like on the top you have the little triangle of plexi the pentagon of frosted plexi and then the two kites

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:06pm EST
well

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:06pm EST
those are pentagons kind of too cause they have triangles of plexi

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:06pm EST
but theyre both made of wood

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:06pm EST
oh

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:06pm EST
wait

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:07pm EST
youd be able to tell then still

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:07pm EST
cause of the frosted plexi one

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:07pm EST
mhmm

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:08pm EST
ugh

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:10pm EST
pretty much

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:11pm EST
why do you hate me????

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:11pm EST
what are you talking about

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:11pm EST
my sister is an idio

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:11pm EST
-.-

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:11pm EST
hey hey not nice

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
i'm probably just gonna die so i dont need to do this project

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:14pm EST
that is true

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:14pm EST
THAT IS NOT HELPING ME

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:14pm EST
I mean

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:14pm EST
steph

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
you are a genius

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:15pm EST

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
rude

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
you got this

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:15pm EST

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:21pm EST
your project

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:23pm EST

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 7:44pm EST
im here if ya need help or a sounding board or something

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:18pm EST
so i made an icosahedron out of that net with the tabs its pretty ratchet but it gets the job done

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:19pm EST
study model numero uno

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:28pm EST
also question if you ever return

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:30pm EST
return

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:30pm EST
i have

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:32pm EST
if i were

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:32pm EST
backtrack

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:32pm EST
I THINK I found a way to make this kinda

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:33pm EST
if i miter the edges of my triangles

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:33pm EST
do you think thatd work, if so, what angle do you think id have to miter them?

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:33pm EST
would 30 work?

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:33pm EST
are you using wood

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:33pm EST
?

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:34pm EST
yes

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:34pm EST
well partially

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:34pm EST
how thick?

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:34pm EST
and are you mitering everything or just the wood

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:34pm EST
it needs to be at least 1/8 to miter

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:34pm EST
everything

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:34pm EST
hmmm

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:34pm EST
imagine the plexi attached to the wood

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:35pm EST
im going to talk to her about this tomorrow. if i can make this all work, and get everything down, if i can attach the plexi to the wood first and then miter

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:35pm EST
138.189685°

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:35pm EST
dihedral angle

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:35pm EST
arccos(-v5/3)

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:35pm EST
is the equstion they used to get that num

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:36pm EST
so half that

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:36pm EST
its be like 70

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:36pm EST
i think i need to draw it out

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:36pm EST
yeah itd have to be more than 45 wouldnt it damn it

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:37pm EST
yes it would

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:37pm EST
i dont think i can do that in the shop

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:37pm EST
it only goes to 45

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:38pm EST
google is literally the opposite of help rn

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:39pm EST
i figured it out

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:39pm EST
i will send you picture

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:41pm EST
it is hard to explain

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:41pm EST
Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:43pm EST
that's not how mitering works

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:43pm EST
oh i see

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:43pm EST
didnt read the arrows

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:43pm EST
sorry

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:43pm EST
i was like

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:43pm EST
how am i making all of these weird angles

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:43pm EST
wait no still hold on

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:44pm EST
okay but the thing is

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:46pm EST
?

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:48pm EST
Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:48pm EST
that's what you're looking for reference as far as the angle you need to cut for mitering

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:48pm EST
it's what's being removed

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:49pm EST
ahh

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:49pm EST
gotcha

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:49pm EST
on sec

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:50pm EST
that would be 20

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:50pm EST
70+20=90

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:51pm EST
why would i need a 90 degree angle

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:52pm EST
ugh

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:52pm EST
Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:52pm EST
because a piece of wood has 90 degree angles

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:53pm EST
yeah?

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:53pm EST
give me a minute

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:55pm EST
Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:55pm EST
so those poorly drawn edges would connect

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:59pm EST
here

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 8:59pm EST
one sec

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 9:05pm EST
it wont load

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 9:05pm EST
retrying

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 9:05pm EST
Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 9:05pm EST
there we go

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
the smaller side of the shape would obviously be the 'bottom

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
the face of the inside

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
what youre telling me is i need to miter at 20 degrees

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
which you have drawn at 45 lol

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
for every edge of the triangle

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
yes

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
well yeah paint is not a science

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
you get the idea!

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
but

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
:'(

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 9:07pm EST
hmm?

Steph DudakWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 9:07pm EST
i need to find a way to test this myself i appreciate your help very much

Nick DevlinWednesday, November 28, 2012 at 9:08pm EST
no prob

Nick DevlinThursday, November 29, 2012 at 6:49pm EST
steph?

Steph DudakThursday, November 29, 2012 at 6:49pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, November 29, 2012 at 6:49pm EST
i figured out why

Steph DudakThursday, November 29, 2012 at 6:50pm EST
...

Steph DudakThursday, November 29, 2012 at 6:50pm EST
why?

Nick DevlinThursday, November 29, 2012 at 6:50pm EST
I thought like you couldnt contact me and told sara that you wanted to talk to me or something

Nick DevlinThursday, November 29, 2012 at 6:50pm EST
then i remember the previous text i sent sara

Nick DevlinThursday, November 29, 2012 at 6:50pm EST
and realized i am stupid

Steph DudakThursday, November 29, 2012 at 6:50pm EST
oh well thats good lol

Nick DevlinThursday, November 29, 2012 at 6:51pm EST
I was complaining that i couldnt complain to sara about making her gift because then i would be giving her too much info and ruin the surprise

Nick DevlinThursday, November 29, 2012 at 6:51pm EST
so she told me to talk to you

Steph DudakThursday, November 29, 2012 at 6:51pm EST
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh

Nick DevlinThursday, November 29, 2012 at 6:51pm EST
I am a genius

Steph DudakThursday, November 29, 2012 at 6:51pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, November 29, 2012 at 6:52pm EST
i love when people use my phrases

Nick DevlinThursday, November 29, 2012 at 6:52pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, November 29, 2012 at 6:53pm EST
in studioooo

Steph DudakThursday, November 29, 2012 at 6:53pm EST
MADE ANOTHER STUDY MODEL

Steph DudakThursday, November 29, 2012 at 6:53pm EST
AN ACTUAL SIZE ONE CAN YOU SKYPE

Nick DevlinThursday, November 29, 2012 at 6:53pm EST
mhmm

Nick DevlinFriday, November 30, 2012 at 10:14am EST
"Not even my old grandfather of more than 60+ years of working wood by hand would try mitering plywood by hand."

Nick DevlinFriday, November 30, 2012 at 10:14am EST
Better figure out somethin

Steph DudakFriday, November 30, 2012 at 10:14am EST
I told you. When do you need this done by

Nick DevlinFriday, November 30, 2012 at 10:15am EST

Nick DevlinFriday, November 30, 2012 at 10:16am EST
I have a circular saw

Nick DevlinFriday, November 30, 2012 at 10:16am EST
and I am looking at ways it might be possible to use that

Nick DevlinFriday, November 30, 2012 at 10:19am EST
i am looking to see if they sell basswood in other stores

Steph DudakFriday, November 30, 2012 at 10:21am EST
If you want I can get some for you and send rich home with it. The only thing is at the school they only sell 4x24 in planks idk of bigger

Nick DevlinFriday, November 30, 2012 at 10:23am EST

Steph DudakFriday, November 30, 2012 at 10:25am EST
I'mma get you 1/8 it's easy to work with

Nick DevlinFriday, November 30, 2012 at 10:25am EST
i'll only need one for my dimmension

Nick DevlinFriday, November 30, 2012 at 10:25am EST
you decide thickness because you would know

Nick DevlinFriday, November 30, 2012 at 10:25am EST

How are your things going?

Steph DudakFriday, November 30, 2012 at 10:37am EST
Well I have one elevation, section, and plan drawn on trace. Gotta put it on Mylar then one more elevation and section Prob won't start the model til tomorrow but I'll get some pieces cut today maybe

Steph DudakFriday, November 30, 2012 at 10:37am EST
I have drawing things to finish

Nick DevlinFriday, November 30, 2012 at 10:37am EST
