Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 5:01pm EDT
hopefully you were doing things other than projects though

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 5:43pm EDT
barely

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 6:09pm EDT
sadness

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 7:48pm EDT
yeah I saw rich and he was over today for dinner and stuff and pretty much watched me work. he just left though

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 7:50pm EDT
i should yell at him for no reason

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 7:50pm EDT
haven't done that in a while

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 7:50pm EDT
womp

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 7:51pm EDT
havent heard that in a while

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 7:53pm EDT
Yeeeeeah

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:04pm EDT
so what else ya do besides see rich and schoolwork>?

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:07pm EDT
that's it. i came home friday and put all my music onto my laptop. saturday i worked on my project and then rich and i went to wawa and the beach. then rich came over around noonish today and i worked on my project til 3ish and we went over grams for dinner which was lovely. and stayed for dessert so i was there til like 6ish. grams made peanut butter pie. good shit. then we came back here and i worked on my project. he left a little while ago because his parents are like raaawr you need to come home and see your cousins even though before we said you didn't have to be here soooo yeah. i decided to take a little break but i'll be getting back to work soon aaand that's what i'll be doing all day tomorrow too.

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:12pm EDT
well

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:13pm EDT
you have an amazing memory

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:13pm EDT
and it doesn't sound too boring

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:13pm EDT
it sounded pretty nice actually

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:15pm EDT
no it wasn't boring, i'm glad i came home this weekend. it's just shitty that i've had to spend a lot of my time doing this annoying project (which isn't perfectly proportional so i know that will hurt me) and that rich had to leave early. i was definitely spoiled being able to see him all day everyday over the summer and then tomorrow i need to go shopping for stuff to bring back to school and i'm not leavin here til later

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:17pm EDT
i am feeling your pain

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:17pm EDT
no sara today

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:17pm EDT
that hasn't happened in weeks

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:17pm EDT
i see her every night

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:17pm EDT
but not tonight

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:19pm EDT
/: do you plan on visiting her on weekends and things?

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:20pm EDT
yeah

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:20pm EDT
we plan to as often as possible, almost every weekend. I am still trying to figure out a way to get to her

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:21pm EDT
train or bus maybe?

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:21pm EDT
if you can't get a ride or something

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:21pm EDT
I still need to look for better deals, but most are too expensive unless I suddenly become rich

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:22pm EDT
haha

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:22pm EDT
become rich

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:22pm EDT
cause rich can drive

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:22pm EDT
funny

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:22pm EDT
anyway

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:22pm EDT
I also plan to get a license this year at some point

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:24pm EDT
trains aren't expensive though?

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:24pm EDT
can always get a job :P

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:25pm EDT
I am

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:25pm EDT
at college

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:29pm EDT
that'll be good then

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:29pm EDT
i hope college gets better the longer i'm there

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:29pm EDT
i'm kind of a wreck and i'm not even there at the moment

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:29pm EDT
it probly will

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:29pm EDT
Alayna said she's happy to go back

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:29pm EDT
which is odd

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:30pm EDT
but I'm happy for her

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:30pm EDT
hopefully it'll get tons better

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:30pm EDT
i'm not surprised, she's been doing better

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:30pm EDT
yeah hopefully i mean it's not that i don't want to go back or anything or that i'm miserable

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:31pm EDT
it's just not as awesome as you'd like

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:31pm EDT
?

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:34pm EDT
i guess so yeah and i'm just away from everybody and it's so stupid cause i'm like overly emotional for no reason and literally every time rich leaves i kinda start crying and i don't know why cause i know i'm gonna see him again soon but i can't help it and i just feel dumb. and like i don't really have any ~friends there. i wouldn't say most of the people i know are much more than acquaintances? i dunno really it's just different. it's not necessarily good or bad. it's just school. that's what it is. it's school.

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:35pm EDT
understandable

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:38pm EDT
i have a feeling

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:39pm EDT
that will happen to me and sara a lot

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:40pm EDT
it's really bad like i know we haven't been together that long. but it's like i dunno we just have such a good time together even if we're not really doing much but then that has to end obviously. it's just weird when you're not able to see the people you see everyday whenever you want anymore. it's something to get used to.

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:41pm EDT
you guys will be alright though, you'll work it out. helps to know when you both have breaks and things too lol i already know every single break i have by heart and i know the next time i'll most lkely be able to come home

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:42pm EDT
haha

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:42pm EDT
good way to know the schedule

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:42pm EDT
I understand though

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:42pm EDT
It just feels like

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:42pm EDT
the entire summer I have been mostly wasting time until I saw sara

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:42pm EDT
then I did things

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:42pm EDT
now sara is gone

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:42pm EDT
what do i do now?

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:43pm EDT
I end up just wasting time until I sleep

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:43pm EDT
yeah i understand. well i mean, once school starts and stuff and you get into the swing of things you'll be a little busier ya know? so it won't be so much wasting time, hopefully. you'll have work to do or studying maybe if you feel you need to do that.

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:49pm EDT
I have completly booked my days

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:49pm EDT
to make sure i am busy

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:50pm EDT
and literature club gives me tons of books to waste time on

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:52pm EDT
you got this all figured out man. I'm trying to find out ways for me to get ahead on my work that way when weekends come i'm not loaded with homework otherwise what's the point of visits

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:55pm EDT
fantastic plan

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:55pm EDT
you try to make time

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:55pm EDT
I try to waste it

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:55pm EDT
hey why you just give me your time!

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:57pm EDT
take it yo i'm already dying it's just this design and drawing class. it's just not enjoyable. this shoe project, i'll probably get a C at best on. i'm going to be taking all day tomorrow to make sure my next model is as close to the real thing as physically possible bc this one just isn't cuttin i

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:57pm EDT
t

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:59pm EDT
you and perfection

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:59pm EDT
need to slow down a bit

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:59pm EDT
you don't need it all the time

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:59pm EDT
but in colelge

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 8:59pm EDT
i guess it'd be useful

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:01pm EDT
no you don't understand

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:01pm EDT
it is SUPPOSED to be perfectly proportional

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:02pm EDT
i do understand

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:02pm EDT
i don't care anymore for this first one because i know i messed it up and i'm just worried about it being handed in

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:02pm EDT
i got a B/B- on my installation

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:02pm EDT
i told you that

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:02pm EDT
yep

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:02pm EDT
but i forgot already

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:02pm EDT
and you reminded me

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:02pm EDT
thank you

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:05pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:12pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:13pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:13pm EDT
i feel smart

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:14pm EDT
i

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:15pm EDT
'm Glad to hear that!

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:15pm EDT
i am procrastinating bad bad bad

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:15pm EDT
very bad

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:15pm EDT
i am just so sick of this cardboard. i'll be back to work soon

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:15pm EDT
i will

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:16pm EDT
is that all you have left?

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:16pm EDT
i have another model to go

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:16pm EDT
which i think will be easier than this one by far

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:16pm EDT
do that one first then!

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:17pm EDT
because the cardboard is placed vertically and my boot has that flap

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:17pm EDT
well i already started the horizontal one, that's what i'm working on now

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:17pm EDT
i only have a little more to go so

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:24pm EDT
cardboard doesn't sound like a very fun material

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:24pm EDT
at all

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
your book is made of cardboard!

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:27pm EDT
use that as your inspiration

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
it's annoying cause i need to change my blade every like 10 mins or so lol and it's just obnoxious to cut through in general

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
use a box cutter

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
i don't have a box cutter

Nick DevlinSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:29pm EDT
buy one to stop wasting exacto knives

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:31pm EDT
i have a box of 100 blades I should say i'm "supposed" to change it every 10-15 mins. i don't really have to so i don't always obvi

Steph DudakSunday, September 2, 2012 at 9:31pm EDT
but i do need to change them often enough

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 4, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
STEPHPHPH

Steph DudakTuesday, September 4, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
mocoasl

Steph DudakTuesday, September 4, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, September 4, 2012 at 7:11pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, September 4, 2012 at 7:11pm EDT
the upside

Steph DudakTuesday, September 4, 2012 at 7:11pm EDT
is

Steph DudakTuesday, September 4, 2012 at 7:11pm EDT
all that work on those models paid off

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 4, 2012 at 7:12pm EDT
yay!

Steph DudakTuesday, September 4, 2012 at 7:12pm EDT
because my teacher loved them. like she literally said they were perfect and i don't need to redo either of them, which a lot of other kids have to do

Steph DudakTuesday, September 4, 2012 at 7:12pm EDT
and the other two studio teachers took my models during the class to use to talk about and show as examples i suppose for their classes

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 4, 2012 at 7:12pm EDT
boss

Steph DudakTuesday, September 4, 2012 at 7:12pm EDT
like she just immediately gave em mine. so that was pretty awesome

Steph DudakTuesday, September 4, 2012 at 7:12pm EDT
i spent....

Steph DudakTuesday, September 4, 2012 at 7:14pm EDT
6 on saturday 6 on sunday too? annnnnnd..... 5, 4 12 9 21 WAT

Steph DudakTuesday, September 4, 2012 at 7:14pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, September 4, 2012 at 7:15pm EDT
came home around actually i think i came home around 6:30ish

Steph DudakTuesday, September 4, 2012 at 7:15pm EDT
then i worked until rich left and that was like two hours later so that was actually 5 hours that day cause im pretty sure after he left iwas like wah and im not doing work

Steph DudakTuesday, September 4, 2012 at 7:15pm EDT
then monday

Steph DudakTuesday, September 4, 2012 at 7:15pm EDT
yesterday

Steph DudakTuesday, September 4, 2012 at 7:17pm EDT
i don't know cause i worked throughout the day, i wanna say 12-4 but idk if that's accurate. then had dinner, worked on it for like an hour, went back over grams, then went home at 7:30 and drove back here. started working again at 11 and stopped at 3

Steph DudakTuesday, September 4, 2012 at 7:17pm EDT
so like 19 still

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 4, 2012 at 7:17pm EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, September 7, 2012 at 12:58pm EDT
The art of juggling has existed since at least the 15th century. Juggling has been recorded in numerous cultures ranging from Romans to the Aztecs even Egypt. Oftentimes people relate juggling to Medieval times when bards and jesters were commonly found entertaining their audiences with skillful displays of acrobatics and juggling along with music or comedy routines. But the real start for juggling began during the Vaudeville era of magicians and performers during the late 1800s. A style known as “Gentleman Juggling” began to emerge. Well-dressed men would manipulate household objects such as hats, wine bottles and cigar boxes. Unfortunately vaudeville and other variety acts began to decline with the advent of movies and television, however juggling still remained popular in its most recognized place, the Circus. More serious juggling has begun thanks to groups such as the World Juggling Federation, which holds conventions annually. These conventions hold competitions to test the professional skill of jugglers. Testing things such as endurance, technical skill, quantity of objects, etc. Overall thanks to groups such as these Juggling is becoming more and more popular with the last WJF convention airing on ESPN. Although I have yet to attend any conventions for technical juggling I have tried to find local groups and organizations the involve juggling. It has been challenging, although growing more popular, juggling is still a very niche hobby. I learned to juggle after watching an episode of Time Warp during my freshman year of High School. My dad knew a little bit and helped me get started. After I learned some basic techniques I learned more online, mainly through Youtube videos. I had pretty much given up looking for juggling groups, most were either for small children or in other states, but then I found one. A small charity group that uses juggling and other prop-based skills to help kids in poor life situations forget about their troubles and learn an interesting talent. I have volunteered at homeless shelters and summer camps for children battling cancer. If I wasn’t told beforehand and these groups of kids were just in a room for me to teach I would have never known how depressing their backgrounds were. They remained cheerful and excited just like any other group of kids. And they learned so quickly! I was used to trying to teach people my own age who were always skeptical about actually learning, which made teaching very difficult. But these children had such enthusiasm that it took barely an hour for them to have 3 balls up in the air. It really is an awesome feeling knowing that you taught someone you have never met, something they will know for years to come. My life would be completely different if I had never learned how to juggle. It still remains just a passionate hobby, yet it impacts my life in many ways. I have been on commercials that my school television production class made for the clothes brand Hurley, I participated in the Toms River East Lip Dub, I entertained at my library for events to teach children reading, and I even took part in the talent show, as clichéd as that is. It amazes me that this small talent of throwing a bunch of things in the air has influenced me in so many ways. Everyone has little hobbies and things they are good at, I am glad that my hobby just so happens to be one of the most flashy and attention attracting hobbies there is. Who doesn’t enjoy a little attention every now and then.

Nick DevlinFriday, September 7, 2012 at 12:58pm EDT

Steph DudakFriday, September 7, 2012 at 11:27pm EDT
Hi Steph, How are you doing? I was wondering how you did on your project? Well I guess you heard the Giants lost but "G" was happy!!! I'm not worried they will do good the rest of the year. I was so glad to have you here for the weekend and look forward to coming down in October. Is there anything exciting going on this weekend? I hope you are not bogged down with homework and can have a little fun but be careful. I want to send you a little goodie bag so tell me what you would like or need. Aunt Dolly and Uncle Dee said they called you but could not leave a message so if you want or get a chance you can give them a call 609-748-5642. They always ask how you are doing. Sean and Kelly started school - Kelly seems pretty excited and Sean is Sean - He is looking forward to band so I guess thats good. Anthony started VoTech and is still working so he is happy. Nick is still looking for a job. "G" took him to AC Moore for a job - they are hiring so maybe he will have some luck I hope so. Well Honey we miss you and hope you are doing OK - have a nice weekend. Love Grams

before people even knew it was a question

Nick DevlinMonday, September 10, 2012 at 8:53pm EDT

Steph DudakWednesday, September 12, 2012 at 9:22pm EDT
So what's the problem exactly

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 12, 2012 at 9:22pm EDT
cigarettes make me angry

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 12, 2012 at 9:23pm EDT
i instantly assume you are stupid if I ever see one

Steph DudakWednesday, September 12, 2012 at 9:23pm EDT
You can't assume someone's stupid because they smoke.

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 12, 2012 at 9:24pm EDT
i do

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 12, 2012 at 9:24pm EDT
i know it's not true

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 12, 2012 at 9:24pm EDT
but ugh

Steph DudakWednesday, September 12, 2012 at 9:24pm EDT
Well I don't agree with that by any means. I don't like smoking as much as the next person

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 12, 2012 at 9:24pm EDT
anyway

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 12, 2012 at 9:25pm EDT
How about I rephrase

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 12, 2012 at 9:25pm EDT
I know plennty of adults that smoke that I think are intelligent

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 12, 2012 at 9:25pm EDT
but they are still younger

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 12, 2012 at 9:25pm EDT
and i've met excpetions

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 12, 2012 at 9:25pm EDT
but overall

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 12, 2012 at 9:26pm EDT
kids our age that openly display they smoke

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 12, 2012 at 9:26pm EDT
are usually obnoxious

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 12, 2012 at 9:26pm EDT
I didn't mean stupid as in unintelligent, i meant it as in they have a bad personality

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 12, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT
ugh idk that picture just made me angry

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 12, 2012 at 9:28pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 6:59am EDT
you always get perfects, but you go insane while getting them

Steph DudakThursday, September 13, 2012 at 11:21am EDT
I'm really bad at school

Steph DudakThursday, September 13, 2012 at 11:22am EDT
I wrote on my math test that a limit is equal to zero. It's not. Because 0/0 is not 0. I am an idiot.

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 11:52am EDT
I JUST LEARNED THAT

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 11:52am EDT
its not undefined either!

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 11:52am EDT
Usualy x/0 is undefined

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 11:53am EDT
but 0/0 is indeterminable

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 11:53am EDT
I understand limits btw. If this is really the hardest thing we do this year as my teacher said I am a very happy person

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 11:53am EDT
I also learned logarithms

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 11:53am EDT
and I understand trig if not how to solve equations and create equations based on diagrams

Steph DudakThursday, September 13, 2012 at 12:09pm EDT
That's very exciting

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 12:14pm EDT
I KNOW

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 12:14pm EDT
I'm sorry about the question you missed though :(

Steph DudakThursday, September 13, 2012 at 12:17pm EDT
Me too because I originally had something else

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 12:19pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, September 13, 2012 at 12:19pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:44pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:44pm EDT
it was like one of those announcers of weird ass shit

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:44pm EDT
like from the twilight zone

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:44pm EDT
that kind of voice and vocab

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:44pm EDT
describing the field of psychology

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:45pm EDT
with random ass videos of futurey looking machines and labs and old computers

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:45pm EDT
Then they go somewhat normal and have badly shot interviews of psychiatrists and psychologists and whatnot

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:46pm EDT
the first experiment

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:46pm EDT
was about scaring college girls

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:46pm EDT
no lie

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:46pm EDT
the gathered a group of girls and said they would be performing painful shock therapy that 'should' have no lasting harm

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:46pm EDT
all FOR SCIENCE

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:47pm EDT
and their all... wtf

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:47pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:47pm EDT
a couple seconds and its gone

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:48pm EDT
and the announcer guy explains all this junk about proper procedure and steps after the experiment etc

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:48pm EDT
so anyway the test worked

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:49pm EDT
(test to see if humans bonded more when frightened)

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:49pm EDT
and the guys like yo we just playin, s'all good get the fuck out

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:50pm EDT
and that was the first half, excluding all the weird animations they had while describint the experiment

Steph DudakThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:50pm EDT
sounds like a fun experiment to participate in

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:51pm EDT
i'd imagine so

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:51pm EDT
the next one is awful

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:51pm EDT
i cant wait to tell sara about it

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:51pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:52pm EDT
WHAT DID THEY DO

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:52pm EDT
nothing that bad

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:52pm EDT
it was kind of funny in a mean way

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:53pm EDT
they were so derpy

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:53pm EDT
they wanted to test visual development

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:53pm EDT
like say you couldnt use your eyes for the first few months of your life

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:53pm EDT
would you still be able to see when you opened them?

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:53pm EDT
how long would it take to become permanently blind

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:54pm EDT
or at least unable to interpret to see the world around you

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:54pm EDT
would the brain develope diffirently without visual input

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:54pm EDT
SO

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:54pm EDT
they kept bunches of kittens in pitch black for differing amount of time

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:55pm EDT
a month two months 6 months

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:55pm EDT
then put them in a maze to see how well they navigated and how well they could see exits

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:55pm EDT
it was funny as hell

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:55pm EDT
these derpy cats walking into walls

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:55pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:55pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:56pm EDT
he was just playing with cats while he talked

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:56pm EDT
like his job is to just hang out with cats and occasionally document them being silly

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:56pm EDT
thats like tumblr's dream

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:56pm EDT
the other guy just sat in this weird computer room

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:56pm EDT
and EVERY SINGLE TIME

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:56pm EDT
they showed him talking

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:57pm EDT
the camera slowly zoomed up on his face

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:57pm EDT
like thats so awkward

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:57pm EDT
this one time by the time he finished talking all you saw was his eyes

Steph DudakThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:57pm EDT
that is awkward

Steph DudakThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:57pm EDT
but the guy that gets to just hang out and play with kittens for a living

Steph DudakThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:58pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:58pm EDT
i wonder if you can keep them as pets when the experiment is done

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:58pm EDT
thatd be sweet

Steph DudakThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:58pm EDT
that'd be awesome

Nick DevlinThursday, September 13, 2012 at 7:58pm EDT

no we are learning limits, but I want to understand basics of trig before we get there

Nick DevlinFriday, September 14, 2012 at 9:29am EDT
everyone freaks out when i mentions i'm in calc and dont know any trig

Steph DudakFriday, September 14, 2012 at 9:30am EDT
Meh You don't really need it yet though? Not for limits. It's just algebra pretty much

Nick DevlinFriday, September 14, 2012 at 9:30am EDT
exactly

Nick DevlinFriday, September 14, 2012 at 9:30am EDT
occasionally they mention sin or something in the equation

Nick DevlinFriday, September 14, 2012 at 9:30am EDT
but i just treat it as a variable and its fine

Nick DevlinFriday, September 14, 2012 at 9:31am EDT
how is your math going?

Nick DevlinFriday, September 14, 2012 at 9:31am EDT
still annoying

Nick DevlinFriday, September 14, 2012 at 9:31am EDT
?

Steph DudakFriday, September 14, 2012 at 9:31am EDT
You'll be fine anyway, you'll be able to figure that all out. Fine except for my test yesterday. No idea how I did but I feel so dumb cause that one question lol don't have it again til Monday

Nick DevlinFriday, September 14, 2012 at 9:32am EDT
funfun

Nick DevlinFriday, September 14, 2012 at 9:32am EDT
hopefully you'll survive. My mind is being blown right now by math things

Nick DevlinFriday, September 14, 2012 at 9:32am EDT
the reasoning behind sin or whateevr

Nick DevlinFriday, September 14, 2012 at 9:33am EDT

Steph DudakFriday, September 14, 2012 at 9:34am EDT
Unit circle stuff yet or no?

Nick DevlinFriday, September 14, 2012 at 9:35am EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, September 14, 2012 at 9:40am EDT
i love those types of things, like the idea behind pythagorean theorum with the squares is awesome

Nick DevlinFriday, September 14, 2012 at 9:41am EDT
and now i can answer when the teacher goes, What kind of graph is this? and people just say random words i dont understand. They obviously dont understand either since they are always wrong

Nick DevlinFriday, September 14, 2012 at 9:41am EDT
but at least they can guess and check tehir way into correctness

Nick DevlinFriday, September 14, 2012 at 9:45am EDT
but yeah is fun

Nick DevlinFriday, September 14, 2012 at 9:45am EDT

Steph DudakMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
no

Steph DudakMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:09pm EDT
she emailed me back just now

Nick DevlinMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:10pm EDT
yay!

Steph DudakMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:12pm EDT
which should i do? not 4 or 6 though i'm also eventually going to have to make it 3 dimensional im pretty sure

Nick DevlinMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:13pm EDT
hm

Nick DevlinMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:14pm EDT
7 could look really cool 3 dimensionaly

Nick DevlinMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:14pm EDT
since the lines are all just lines not planes you could mess with perspective

Nick DevlinMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:14pm EDT
same goes for 8 i suppose but the colours arent as fun

Nick DevlinMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:15pm EDT
i also just like how 9 and 3 look

Nick DevlinMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:15pm EDT
I don't know exactly how you're supposed to review like what you learned

Nick DevlinMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:15pm EDT
so I just picked the ones I liked most

Steph DudakMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:16pm EDT
i just have to pick one it doesnt have anything to do with something i learned

Nick DevlinMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:21pm EDT
oh

Nick DevlinMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:21pm EDT
hmmm

Steph DudakMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:21pm EDT
it's just that

Nick DevlinMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:21pm EDT
then yeah

Nick DevlinMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:21pm EDT
the bottom

Steph DudakMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:21pm EDT
i'll eventually have to build this

Nick DevlinMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:21pm EDT
left

Steph DudakMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:21pm EDT
so

Nick DevlinMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:23pm EDT
yeah

Nick DevlinMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:23pm EDT
that would look so cool

Nick DevlinMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:23pm EDT
you could make it a web of ropes

Nick DevlinMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:23pm EDT
or you could have lines from the side

Nick DevlinMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:23pm EDT
but then when you turn it around its all fun shapes

Steph DudakMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:24pm EDT
woods

Steph DudakMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:24pm EDT
it's made of wood

Nick DevlinMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:24pm EDT
?

Steph DudakMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:24pm EDT
balsa and bass

Nick DevlinMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:24pm EDT
my second option still words

Nick DevlinMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:24pm EDT
works*

Nick DevlinMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:26pm EDT
or instead of ropes dowels work fine too

Nick DevlinMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:26pm EDT
but yeah idk

Steph DudakMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:26pm EDT
no

Nick DevlinMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:26pm EDT
I know whats in my head

Steph DudakMonday, September 17, 2012 at 7:26pm EDT

Nick DevlinMonday, September 17, 2012 at 10:32pm EDT

Nick DevlinMonday, September 17, 2012 at 10:32pm EDT
she has to change her name

Nick DevlinMonday, September 17, 2012 at 10:32pm EDT

I never expect high grades in that class. Let me tell you what's written on the sheet tho

Steph DudakTuesday, September 18, 2012 at 6:12pm EDT
1. Concept- Degree of difficulty: high 2. Development- overall design quality and inventiveness: high Consistency of effort: very high 3. Product- drawing craft: medium Model craft: very high Verbal presentation: high Completion: very high Had all models and drawings Comments: beautiful craft and care taken with this project. Don't let yourself get easily frustrated as it can show in the work. Learn when to step away from a project and reassess what you're doing. Also trust yourself more, your wire model was so much better than you think it was.

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 18, 2012 at 6:17pm EDT
haah

Steph DudakSunday, September 23, 2012 at 9:08pm EDT
FOREIGN POLICY Obama’s foreign policy is a plan to end the war in Iraq as well as finish the fight with the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan. The plan also serves to secure nuclear weapons and loose nuclear materials from terrorists, renew American diplomacy, and support strong alliances and eventually reach lasting peace in Israeli-Palestinian conflict. CULTURAL VALUES WOMEN’S RIGHTS/ABORTION Obama takes a pro-choice stand on abortion. He believes that the health care choices of women are personal decisions and should not have any interference from politicians. Furthermore, because of Obamacare, insurance plans will begin to fully cover birth control as a part of women’s preventive care (which also includes things such as mammograms and cancer screenings). Something Obama plans to end is charging women more than men for the same health insurance coverage. EQUAL RIGHTS Issues regarding the LGBT community also differ between the two candidates because Obama highly supports the LGBT community. He supports same-sex marriage and repealed “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” so gay and lesbian service members do not have to lie about who they are to serve their country. He also extended hospital visitation and medical decision-making rights to LGBT couples, signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, and endorsed the Respect for Marriage Act. Aside from this, policies have been enacted by Obama that will promote the hiring of disabled people, increase funding for students with disabilities, provide Americans with access to affordable health care, and improve accessibility standards. ECONOMY HEALTHCARE (OBAMACARE) Obamacare intends to put the health of families first, ensuring access to free preventive care and protecting consumers from insurance company abuses—even if you already have insurance. The Affordable Care Act holds insurance companies responsible, putting an end to abuses such as capping or dropping your coverage when you get sick. This act also helps people with Medicare save on the care they need to stay healthy which includes free preventive services to lower costs on prescription drugs and monthly premiums. Obama also plans to put an end to women being charged more than men for the same coverage by health insurance companies.

loose nuclear materials from terrorists

Nick DevlinSunday, September 23, 2012 at 9:08pm EDT
what does that mean?

Nick DevlinSunday, September 23, 2012 at 9:09pm EDT
never refer to anything as obamacare in government writing if you wish to be taken seriously

Steph DudakSunday, September 23, 2012 at 9:09pm EDT
it's not a formal paper

Steph DudakSunday, September 23, 2012 at 9:09pm EDT
it has headings

Steph DudakSunday, September 23, 2012 at 9:10pm EDT
it's often referred to as that and honestly i don't think my teacher will give a fuck cause he's called it that

Nick DevlinSunday, September 23, 2012 at 9:10pm EDT
stupid man

Steph DudakSunday, September 23, 2012 at 9:10pm EDT
but i will keep that in mind

Steph DudakSunday, September 23, 2012 at 9:10pm EDT
like i said It's not formal it's just to get the idea of the candidates platform

Nick DevlinSunday, September 23, 2012 at 9:11pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, September 23, 2012 at 9:51pm EDT
nuclear weapons and materials that aren't very well guarded, can easily fall into the wrong hands ie terrorists

Nick DevlinMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:15pm EDT
Descriptive Essay Libraries are what . Stories and memories passing from each hand to the next resting patiently on shelves in between readers, waiting for the next mind to enrich. A library is an organized collection of resources made accessible to a defined community for reference or borrowing. (Library) In the particular case of my library, the community that uses it is comprised of friends and family. Two 6-foot bookshelves are snugly fitted into what once used to be a closet. The shelves that once held coats and hats have been discarded and replaced by shelves that hold hardcovers and paperbacks. Books endeavor to be organized, with fiction lining the shelves alphabetically and nonfiction precariously stacked atop each bookshelf. But as in every group, this bunch of books has its rebels. Novels creep deep into nonfiction territory and the occasional reference book finds its way onto my shelves. Not only books reside on these shelves though. Knickknacks and doodads aplenty adorn the boards, each with its own story. On the top shelf in front of my series of Harry Potter books a bluish glass egg containing swirling columns of trapped air pockets sits. My granda bought be the ornament on our trip to Scotland. A picture frame with images of the color guard I was a part of for two seasons is on the same shelf, given to me as a gift after graduating. One of the high quality model trucks that I receive every Christmas from the Hess Company is on a different level. All of these things that have as much of a sentimental history to me as the actual annals elsewhere in my library. Those memories are brought up even more clearly thanks to the faint scent of dried glue and old paper emanating from each book. Every book I have read has its own set of memories. The book Flyte by Angie Sage remind me of when I used to visit the horse races in the winter with my father, the usual crowds brought in by summer had faded, the only horses left were those on the hundreds of televisions lining every wall. Books are more than just the story in and of themselves, they create new stories of the time you spent with them. Even the library as a whole brings up memories of the growth it has had throughout my life. The library started out as only a small 2 shelf bookcase stuffed with children’s mystery novels and scientific animal books and the pride of every reader, Dr. Seuss books. At some point I read two series that influenced my life more than any other, Harry Potter and Eragon. Opening my imagination to magic and dragons and fantastic creatures and places, these books led me to more books like them. After a few years of collecting there were more books lying in piles around my room than there were actually in the bookcase. This led to a larger bookcase being added, proudly standing with 5 shelves. It was made from a light wood and had a flimsy appearance that was enhanced once laden with dozens of heavy texts. The books, mainly science fiction and fantasy, were collected from their various collections around my rooms and organized into rows on the new bookshelves. But that was not the end of the growth spurt. Yet another bookcase was added, this one of a much darker, purple hue that was almost black. The library was now in its current placement, but the books always change. Old books taken from public libraries that no longer want them, new books bought fresh from the store, worn books passed along circles of friends, and some books that remain constant, the ones I have had since I first began, all going in and out of my library. One day I hope for my library to grow even more, possibly swelling in to an entire room. Since I was young I had this notion that the more books that were in my library, the smarter I would become. I discovered that this was true, but in a less dramatic sense. I cannot just buy books and put them in my library in order to gain knowledge as if I were a computer downloading information. I have to read and understand the books in my library.

Nick DevlinMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:16pm EDT
Like I stop mid sentence a couple times

Steph DudakMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:25pm EDT
the first paragraph has me a bit confused second paragraph-- what once was a closet, instead of what once used to be. sounds awkie. or say that used to be cause you use the shelves that once in the next sentence my grandpa bought me* the ornament All of these things that have as much of a sentimental history to me as the actual annals elsewhere in my library take out that? the book flyte reminds* Even the library as a whole brings up memories of the growth it has had throughout my life The growth of the library? this sentence didn't sit well in my head. . . . children’s mystery novels and scientific animal books and the pride of every reader, Dr. Seuss books (take out the and between novels and scientific, put a comma) purple hue that was almost black almost black is irrelevant. if i was a reader i would not care to know that. do you mention any other bookshelf colors? if not fix that because it's unimportant unless the purple is significant in some way. it's not bad i actually kinda like it

Steph DudakMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:25pm EDT
is that it finished though? cause i feel like that last paragraph there's something more you want to say

Nick DevlinMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:25pm EDT
none of the paragraphs were finished

Steph DudakMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:26pm EDT
the last especially stands out

Nick DevlinMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:26pm EDT
and it is a descriptive so I am supposed to use all of my senses

Nick DevlinMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:26pm EDT
and I will work on it while I implement your corrections

Steph DudakMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:27pm EDT
uhhh one sec i'm gonna go through the end and beginning of paragraphs again

Nick DevlinMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:30pm EDT
have fun!

Steph DudakMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:31pm EDT
you say the community that uses your library is compromised of friends and family the next paragraph you don't address that idk that seems kinda funny to me cause it sets up potential for like a personal anecdote about said family and friends and your library the whole first paragraph just has to be fixed from second to third you talk about books creating new stories of the time you spent with them and then how it brings up memories don't say new stories, just say stories. i read the sentence once and this is just me being dumb but i thought of the sentence as new stories and then memories. future and then past yk? so maybe take out the new and reword the last sentence of paragraph two a bit three to four? is that what i'm on? four is the last paragraph? i think it's fine how it goes in between those. you just need to close the paragraph

Nick DevlinMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:33pm EDT
I am horrid at intros

Nick DevlinMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:33pm EDT
so yeah

Nick DevlinMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:34pm EDT
I just don't know how to introduce things without sounding like I'm two

Nick DevlinMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:34pm EDT
I want it to be clear what's going on though

Steph DudakMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:35pm EDT
one min

Nick DevlinMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:35pm EDT
yeah the first paragraph is supposed to be about family and friends and junk with libraries

Nick DevlinMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:36pm EDT
Like sort of describing how I *use* my library

Nick DevlinMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:36pm EDT

Stories and memories passing from each hand to the next, resting patiently on shelves in between readers, waiting for the next mind to enrich. i really like this sentence, i'm just trying to figure out how to make it into an intro while tying it to what you have now kinda

Nick DevlinMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:39pm EDT
hmm

Steph DudakMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:39pm EDT
i don't like how you define library as an actual definition after that

Steph DudakMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:39pm EDT
it's too stark a contrast

Nick DevlinMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:40pm EDT
I know, I am trying to fit a transtition now

Steph DudakMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:40pm EDT
like the definition is this just cut thing

Steph DudakMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:40pm EDT
textbook like while the sentence before isn't quite textbook like

Nick DevlinMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:46pm EDT
Stories and memories passing from each hand to the next resting patiently on shelves in between readers, waiting for the next mind to enrich. Libraries have been a place of stored knowledge for centuries, passing down information between people who may have never met. One of the greatest communal efforts to share information, Wikipedia, states that “a library is an organized collection of resources made accessible to a defined community for reference or borrowing.” (Library) In the particular case of my library, the community that uses it is much more personal comprised of friends and family, that contribute to and benefit from my library.

Nick DevlinMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:47pm EDT
I'm getting closer

Steph DudakMonday, September 24, 2012 at 8:47pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 6:37pm EDT
good enough

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 6:38pm EDT
I am scared though

Steph DudakTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 6:38pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 6:38pm EDT
calculus

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 6:38pm EDT
I am basically caught up

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 6:38pm EDT
which means I am zoning out and getting bored during class

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 6:38pm EDT
which means

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 6:38pm EDT
regression to high school

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 6:38pm EDT
I am working against it!!

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 6:39pm EDT
but still

Steph DudakTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 6:39pm EDT
that is the worst but at least you know what youre doing now, that's always good. make up your own math problems to do during class

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 6:40pm EDT
yeah

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 6:40pm EDT
i shall try that

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 6:40pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 7:28pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 7:28pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 7:44pm EDT
ohhh

Steph DudakTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 7:44pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 7:44pm EDT
you're actually watching 60 inutes

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 7:44pm EDT
I thought you meant it was an hour long

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 7:44pm EDT
well 60 minutes isnt as bad as some things

Steph DudakTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 7:44pm EDT
nah but i don't find it that compelling i guess i don't know like i said it's not something i'm really interested in so it bores me and i'm already tired as all hell

Steph DudakTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 7:45pm EDT
so it's going over my head

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 7:45pm EDT
take a break

Steph DudakTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 7:45pm EDT
i don't have time

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 7:45pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 7:45pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 7:45pm EDT

I looked over them, they are intelligent

Nick DevlinTuesday, September 25, 2012 at 7:46pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, September 26, 2012 at 7:53pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, September 27, 2012 at 11:13am EDT
I think there are derivatives on my test

Nick DevlinThursday, September 27, 2012 at 11:13am EDT
what is a derivative

Nick DevlinThursday, September 27, 2012 at 11:13am EDT
i am scared

Steph DudakThursday, September 27, 2012 at 11:14am EDT
derivatives are easy there are also like little rules to help make them easy

Steph DudakThursday, September 27, 2012 at 11:14am EDT
for example

Steph DudakThursday, September 27, 2012 at 11:15am EDT
the derivative of any constant is 0 x = 1 x^2 = 2x --- the reason for this is because you move the exponent 2, and make it a coefficient, then you subtract one from the exponent (2-1=1, therefore x) you do the same for other powers. so if its x^4, the derivative is 4x^3

Steph DudakThursday, September 27, 2012 at 11:16am EDT
if you have more than one like term so lets say you have

Nick DevlinThursday, September 27, 2012 at 11:16am EDT
x^73=73x^72?

Steph DudakThursday, September 27, 2012 at 11:16am EDT
exactly

Nick DevlinThursday, September 27, 2012 at 11:16am EDT
funfun

Nick DevlinThursday, September 27, 2012 at 11:17am EDT
continue

Steph DudakThursday, September 27, 2012 at 11:17am EDT
2x^2 + 5x +1 you add each derivative i mean when we were first doing it he had us do it in steps but i find no need to do that

Steph DudakThursday, September 27, 2012 at 11:17am EDT
so 2x^2, the derivative is 4x because 2(2)x^1

Steph DudakThursday, September 27, 2012 at 11:17am EDT
then the derivative of 5x is 5 because 5(1) = 5 and then 1=0

Steph DudakThursday, September 27, 2012 at 11:18am EDT
so the derivative of 2x^2 + 5x + 1 = 4x + 5

Nick DevlinThursday, September 27, 2012 at 11:18am EDT
mkay

Nick DevlinThursday, September 27, 2012 at 11:18am EDT
that's odd but whatever

Nick DevlinThursday, September 27, 2012 at 11:18am EDT
thanks for explaining that I must now go to a bake sale

Steph DudakThursday, September 27, 2012 at 11:18am EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, September 27, 2012 at 11:18am EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, September 27, 2012 at 11:18am EDT
4x^6+3x^2+4

Nick DevlinThursday, September 27, 2012 at 11:19am EDT
24x^5+6x

Nick DevlinThursday, September 27, 2012 at 11:19am EDT
