The unit circle Which isn't hard

Steph DudakThursday, July 5, 2012 at 5:26pm EDT
Trig identities

Steph DudakThursday, July 5, 2012 at 5:27pm EDT
All that stuff Not hard I can send you copies of my pre calc notes if you want :P

Nick DevlinThursday, July 5, 2012 at 5:27pm EDT
seriously? I got every trig question wrong I'm pretty sure -.-

Nick DevlinThursday, July 5, 2012 at 5:27pm EDT
and that would be wonderful

Steph DudakThursday, July 5, 2012 at 5:27pm EDT
I'll really do that if you want. I'm keeping that notebook forever

Nick DevlinThursday, July 5, 2012 at 5:28pm EDT

As much as I can anyway Yeah 14th next Saturday

Nick DevlinThursday, July 5, 2012 at 5:30pm EDT
i mostly just need trig stuff, but anything you think wasn't covered much in algebra 2 at all would be good as well

Nick DevlinThursday, July 5, 2012 at 5:30pm EDT
I think it's hilarious that I have no clue how to divide with polynomials but I was still able to get one of the answers

Steph DudakThursday, July 5, 2012 at 5:31pm EDT
Most of my notes are stuff we didn't really do in algebra 2 lol I'll probably end up copying like all of them and you can decide what you need to know But You remember imaginary numbers? Quadratic formula? -b/2a? Synthetic division?

Steph DudakThursday, July 5, 2012 at 5:32pm EDT
Linear equations

Steph DudakThursday, July 5, 2012 at 5:32pm EDT
Midpt and distance formulas

Nick DevlinThursday, July 5, 2012 at 5:32pm EDT
I remember imaginary numbers, I remember quadratic, and I can google the formulas

Nick DevlinThursday, July 5, 2012 at 5:32pm EDT
synthetic division

Nick DevlinThursday, July 5, 2012 at 5:33pm EDT
i do not remember

Steph DudakThursday, July 5, 2012 at 5:34pm EDT
Like I said I'll copy most I also have my review for the final if you'd like to keep that lol

Nick DevlinThursday, July 5, 2012 at 5:42pm EDT
whatever you think I'd find helpful

Nick DevlinThursday, July 5, 2012 at 5:43pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, July 5, 2012 at 6:00pm EDT

Steph DudakFriday, July 6, 2012 at 12:07am EDT
Lots of coffee

Steph DudakFriday, July 6, 2012 at 12:07am EDT

this

Steph DudakSaturday, July 21, 2012 at 12:54am EDT
Oh yaknow Usual lol went over Rich's, played video games, then Rich decided to be a decent human being and drop Josh's shoes off. And rich and I were planning to go to Applebee's and then see dark knight rises and since we were at Josh's house and he wasn't doing anything he tagged along with us

Steph DudakSaturday, July 21, 2012 at 12:54am EDT
Josh made many inappropriate jokes involving Richard and me. But that's just josh being josh

Nick DevlinSaturday, July 21, 2012 at 12:54am EDT
what else would he do---

Nick DevlinSaturday, July 21, 2012 at 12:54am EDT
wowoww wait

Nick DevlinSaturday, July 21, 2012 at 12:55am EDT
rich a decent human being?

Steph DudakSaturday, July 21, 2012 at 12:55am EDT
Lmfao

Nick DevlinSaturday, July 21, 2012 at 12:55am EDT
I mistrust that entire statement

Steph DudakSaturday, July 21, 2012 at 12:55am EDT
Josh says I have him whipped

Nick DevlinSaturday, July 21, 2012 at 12:55am EDT
no shit

Nick DevlinSaturday, July 21, 2012 at 12:55am EDT
everyone has rich whipped

Steph DudakSaturday, July 21, 2012 at 12:55am EDT
I texted him before we left to make sure he was home

Steph DudakSaturday, July 21, 2012 at 12:55am EDT
And he was like

Steph DudakSaturday, July 21, 2012 at 12:55am EDT
... Why.

Steph DudakSaturday, July 21, 2012 at 12:55am EDT
And I told him and he's like is this a trap?

Nick DevlinSaturday, July 21, 2012 at 12:55am EDT
your answer?

Steph DudakSaturday, July 21, 2012 at 12:56am EDT
And so I sent him a picture of the shoes in the back seat

Steph DudakSaturday, July 21, 2012 at 12:56am EDT
And that was right before we walked up to his door

Steph DudakSaturday, July 21, 2012 at 12:56am EDT
And he was like wow Cause rich was like Should I drop his shoes off? And I was like yeah. Be a decent human being. Give him his shoes back.

Steph DudakSaturday, July 21, 2012 at 12:57am EDT
So that was another thing josh carried on a couple times through the night; rich being whipped. Josh thanked me and was actually nicer than usual today lol

Steph DudakSaturday, July 21, 2012 at 12:58am EDT
He didn't accuse me of being a robot for once AND he actually told me I had emotion

Steph DudakSaturday, July 21, 2012 at 12:58am EDT
Winning

Nick DevlinSaturday, July 21, 2012 at 12:58am EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, July 26, 2012 at 2:10pm EDT
i could draw a penguin

Steph DudakThursday, July 26, 2012 at 2:10pm EDT
buy her a five foot stuffed penguin to beat out the one franco got her for their anniversary or whatever the occasion was

Steph DudakThursday, July 26, 2012 at 2:10pm EDT
force her to bring it to college with her

Steph DudakThursday, July 26, 2012 at 2:10pm EDT
not that that'd be hard

Nick DevlinThursday, July 26, 2012 at 2:10pm EDT
force her?

Nick DevlinThursday, July 26, 2012 at 2:11pm EDT
yeah i was about to say

Nick DevlinThursday, July 26, 2012 at 2:11pm EDT
we'd have to force her to seperate from it

Steph DudakThursday, July 26, 2012 at 2:11pm EDT
more like tell her and she'll just agree that that's a fabulous idea

Nick DevlinThursday, July 26, 2012 at 2:11pm EDT
that sounds more likely

Steph DudakThursday, July 26, 2012 at 2:11pm EDT
she'd thank you for suggesting it

Steph DudakThursday, July 26, 2012 at 2:11pm EDT
because most people would be like STOP CARRYING THAT AROUND

Steph DudakThursday, July 26, 2012 at 2:11pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:00pm EDT
how popular am i

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:00pm EDT
scale of 1- 1000

Steph DudakTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:00pm EDT
uh

Steph DudakTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:00pm EDT
501

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:00pm EDT
thanks

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:00pm EDT
ugh i can't decide how to measure popularity

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:01pm EDT
because if it's by 'people that know me'

Steph DudakTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:01pm EDT
i added 1+1000 and divided by 2

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:01pm EDT
i'd actually be one of the most popular people in school

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:01pm EDT
juggling ftw

Steph DudakTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:01pm EDT
because idk how to answer that question

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:01pm EDT
yeah neither do i

Steph DudakTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:01pm EDT
so i figured i'd take the average

Steph DudakTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:01pm EDT
haha

Steph DudakTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:02pm EDT
why?

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:02pm EDT
using a formula from a john green novel

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:02pm EDT
just for fun

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:02pm EDT
he made it as a sort of joke

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:02pm EDT
the guy in his book was this child prodigy

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:02pm EDT
who sucked at relationships

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:02pm EDT
they all fell apart

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:03pm EDT
so he tried to create a formula to determine if a relationship would fall apart or not

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:03pm EDT
unfortunately all f the variables ar esubjectivre

Steph DudakTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:04pm EDT
ahhhh gotcha

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:13pm EDT
yeah

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:13pm EDT
so apparently i would be the one to end the relationship

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:13pm EDT
assuming i can objectively quantify the variable

Steph DudakTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:13pm EDT
lies

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:13pm EDT
s

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:13pm EDT
yes

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:13pm EDT
it is

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:14pm EDT
neither of us would ever end the relationship, the only thing that could break us up would be external forces like college or housing or something

Steph DudakTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:15pm EDT
even still

Steph DudakTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:15pm EDT
college is dumb

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:16pm EDT
very

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:16pm EDT
but it does keep us apart for weeks to months at a time

Steph DudakTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:16pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, July 31, 2012 at 1:16pm EDT
