Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:00pm EST
that is indeed fantastic!

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:01pm EST
well keep up the good work then, i'm off to think of things to write in this other than "i didn't really do much but play wow and hang out"

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:02pm EST
make it sounds good then!

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:02pm EST
I played strategic games of combat

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:03pm EST
while not spending time with my contemporaries

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:03pm EST
in pursit of expanding my social growth

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:03pm EST
which tends to wane while playing the aforementioned strategic combat gamews

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:04pm EST
lol fabulous

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:05pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:08pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:08pm EST
my total so far is $150

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:08pm EST
i could use that money for so much stuff

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:08pm EST
important stuff

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:09pm EST
i think the only fee that i have waivered is the one for drexel

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:09pm EST
yep

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:10pm EST
I haven't even visited another school -.-

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:10pm EST
everything else is $70. lol i'm in the same boat. i've visited one college, and i'm not even applying there

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:13pm EST
which college?

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:16pm EST
arcadia

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:16pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:16pm EST
where you got the shirt

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:16pm EST
yeep lol

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:16pm EST
it was a free shirt

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:17pm EST
now if the school itself had the same price tag

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:17pm EST
maybe you'd apply

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:17pm EST
they don't have an architecture major lol if any school had the same price tag, i'd be a happy camper

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:17pm EST
i'm debating on even applying to syracuse now

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:18pm EST
that's another $70 fee.

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:18pm EST
philadelphia university is 40

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:18pm EST
Maybe you should just find some school in like idaho where they practically beg people to apply

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:19pm EST
i know right lol

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:19pm EST
so. i don't think mrs morgan actually reads the things i hand in to her..

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:19pm EST
doubtful

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:19pm EST
i had to hand in a college essay a million years ago

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:19pm EST
and

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:19pm EST
hold on i'm gonna send you it

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:19pm EST
funfnu

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:19pm EST
i probably already have

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:20pm EST
its would make sense

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:21pm EST
“To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.” -- Ralph Waldo Emerson. Growing up, we are heavily influenced by the people around us. One main idea we’re given is we can’t live happy, successful lives unless we get a job that will make us a lot of money. While money is an important factor of life, it is also important that you spend your life doing something you actually enjoy doing. It is important to follow your own path and see where it takes you. You only have one life to live; do what makes you happy. This is something I have considered in deciding my major in college. I’ve always taken an interest in art and math which influenced me to take Introduction to Computer Graphics when I began high school, aside from my already developed interest in computer graphics as well. As a result of my enjoyment in this class, I took Advanced Computer Graphics junior year, along with regular art classes my sophomore, junior, and senior year, and am currently enrolled in an Architectural Design class. At the end of my Advanced Computer Graphics class, we started drawing floor plans in DataCad. It was at this point that I really knew I wanted to major in architecture because of how much fun I had creating the floor plans and elevation views. This year I’m expanding on that knowledge and have begun drawing floor plans by hand. While it takes a while to do, the final product is worth it. Throughout high school, I have reconsidered multiple times my major choice for college but I’m now sure of what I want to do. What I have also realized is I might have always known this. Since I was younger, I loved looking at houses and buildings while thinking of ideas for a future home of mine that I wanted to design myself. Living in a house that I designed has always been a dream of mine and I plan to do what it takes to make this dream come true. BUT ANYWAY. on the paper i printed out, that i also seem to have lost, she was all great job blahblahblah or whatevv. and only made some grammatical corrections that i currently do not recall. i wrote this like the day before it was due just to get it done.

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:21pm EST
i was definitely talking to you as i wrote this

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:21pm EST
yes yoou were

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:21pm EST
the wuote

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:21pm EST
quote*

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:21pm EST
i remember it

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:24pm EST
it's not even good

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:24pm EST
well I wouldn't say not good

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:24pm EST
but it is like

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:24pm EST
'for school'

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:24pm EST
like what you'd right to get something over with

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:25pm EST
it isn't even really finished lol. i kinda just ended it like that cause i was tired and didn't know what else to really say. but exactly. mrs morgan is no help

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:30pm EST
god damn it. rpi asks for a specific sat date. whyyy

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:30pm EST
aww

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:30pm EST
sorry

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:30pm EST
i did tell you i only got like 10 extra points

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:30pm EST
i saw that actually i'm sorry to hear that :|

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:31pm EST
which was totally worth the 60 bucks i wasted--i mean spent

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:31pm EST
absolutely wasted

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:31pm EST
oh shoot

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:32pm EST
nooot gonna send scores through collegeboard

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:32pm EST
how else can you send?

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:33pm EST
through the school

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:33pm EST
it seems

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:34pm EST
"I would like my test scores mailed with my application"

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:34pm EST
for free?

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:34pm EST
hmm if that's free I must try it

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:36pm EST
yeah. i feel like through collegeboard it's like, guaranteed they'll get it to them. but you need to pay for every school you're sending it to

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:36pm EST
which is again, ridiculous imo

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:39pm EST
30.50

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:39pm EST
if i want to send to 3 colleges

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:39pm EST
$10.50 to send scores to a school i might not even get into, on top of the however much i paid to take the test 3 times, well over $100, and on top of application fees. you know that's nearly $400.

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:40pm EST
how much did the SAT cost? wasn't it 49?

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:40pm EST
i missed the deadline for one of em

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:41pm EST
yep 49

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:41pm EST
i wonder where all that money goes

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:41pm EST
and it's like 75 if you miss the deadline

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:43pm EST
$173 for three tests $42 for sending the scores $180 for application fees $395 .......... idk but it better go somewhere real important

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:49pm EST
I say it should go to paying off my college debt

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:50pm EST
which is unlikely

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:51pm EST
highly

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 12:51pm EST
it should though

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:07pm EST
remeber that children's story i was going to fix?

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:07pm EST
Yeah I'm not

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:07pm EST
I'm just gonna draw some picture

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:08pm EST
Whatever gets the job done faster

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:08pm EST
And is sufficient enough

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:08pm EST
i was a bout to say

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:08pm EST
fastest way to do it

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:08pm EST
would be to turn in a couple lines on a paper

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:11pm EST
Mehhhh. Make it look a little decent

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:11pm EST
yeah i will be

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
i might include like one pop up drawing at either the 'climax' or the end

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:16pm EST
have you made progress on art shtuff?

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:16pm EST
or think of a background for stained glass

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:17pm EST
I've made no progress on anything cause I suck and like to stress myself out and make myself more miserable than I already am

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:17pm EST
At least, that's the only logical explanation

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:18pm EST
well its illogical

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:18pm EST
to do it

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:18pm EST
but it is normal for you

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:19pm EST
After I make my fucking bed cause no one cares what they do to my room after they sleep in it, I'll most likely be up all night doing stuff

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:19pm EST
Sleep probably won't be an option which sucks cause I'm fucking tired but

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:19pm EST
You know

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:19pm EST
Consequences

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:19pm EST
I'll learn eventually

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:19pm EST
i still haven't :(

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:20pm EST
stupid school keeps reinforcing the idea that doing less homework and procrastination does not effect my grade

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:20pm EST
and if it does, judging from my studies on my grades

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:20pm EST
their effect is positivr

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:21pm EST
Easy senior year man

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:21pm EST
By doing nothing you're doing something right

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:22pm EST
that is true

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:27pm EST
All I'm worried about this week is getting my art projects in and getting my NJIT and RPI stuff in by Thursday. That just requires me to think a little bit about what I'm gonna write for the little essay sections that aren't even essays. Minimum 250 word character things and why I'm choosing architecture as my career etc. Nothing I can't handle. I need to get a calendar

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:28pm EST
one of those giant ones?

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:28pm EST
that teachers have on their desks

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:28pm EST
Yeah that I can write everything I have to do on. Set up a schedule

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:28pm EST
Stick it on my wall

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:29pm EST
And use it from now til I don't need to give a fuck about school anymore

Nick DevlinSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:29pm EST
only 5 more years

Steph DudakSunday, January 1, 2012 at 7:31pm EST
Basically

Steph DudakMonday, January 2, 2012 at 11:58pm EST
You're not awake are you adgjldsmkl

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 6:31am EST
Sorry, I attempted and failed to go to sleep at a reasonable time

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 6:31am EST
It was a very fun time staring at the wall for an hour and a half though

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 2:17pm EST
I went to bed at 4am. Where were you todayyy

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 3:12pm EST
i died

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 3:12pm EST
and left school

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 3:12pm EST
it sucked

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 4:44pm EST
That's awful o.o

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 7:56pm EST
then i came home and slept and died some more

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 7:56pm EST
die is a filler word for puke btw

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 7:56pm EST
anyway

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 7:57pm EST
how was lunch without me?

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:02pm EST
Aw poor nick ): Well let's see. The seat in front of me was empty lol. I worked for like five minutes on an art project that I still gotta finish but at least it's small. Actually I have to do four art projects still. But I got actual homework today which is unfortunate. I didn't get to rant to you today that's not fun. Morgan didn't collect the assignment we were supposed to do over break which is awesome bc I didn't really do it. Did you just like randomly get sick?

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:06pm EST
this morning actually, told my mom i didn't feel good drank some tea. Then I took like 3 steps out of the car and when she drove away i puked. I thought that was it, since like i didn't feel sick i just felt nauseous, so i went inside cleaned my face. Went to first period and listened to Kerry's zombie story where lindenmayer killed me. then i kinda ran to the bathroom

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:06pm EST
i gave up after that

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:06pm EST
and i missed your rant today

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:07pm EST
AW. That's awful. Are you feeling any better now?

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:07pm EST
yeah

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
i slept and sara came over and gave me crackers

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
and i watched tv

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
that helped a a lot

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:10pm EST
what was today's rant gonna be about?

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:10pm EST
just wondering

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:13pm EST
Oh no just today's events like usual. How we got morgan majorly off topic before having to take notes And how she didn't collect the assignment that I did attempt to do fourth and fifth period I was gonna show you my art projects too cause I had all of em with me. But yk. You weren't there so lol. I was going to spend lunch brainstorming ideas but that failed cause I got distracted cause I was discussing art in general with Laurie and Carly. And tori was extremely upset and I had like no clue what to say to her. Like I literally sat there and hugged her for five minutes while she sobbed into my shoulder/hair. So eventful period

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:16pm EST
sara said drama happened that she didn't understand.

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:16pm EST
was tori okay?

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:16pm EST
or at least improve

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:20pm EST
Not really. She was actually a wreck. She was saying how her dad was leaving and how it was basically all her fault bc of all the shit she's been doing that she shouldn't be. But that he's crazy himself and. I like can't even. But she needs help. I asked her if she's getting any and she said yeah but I don't really know what kind of help she's getting and if it's the right kind of help. But I don't think it's effective. She was sobbing and shaking like crazy. And Carly's mad at her at the moment too which is making tori even more upset. But Carly was telling me it's bc tori isn't listening to her and she's basically going out and wrecking herself when Carly's trying to tell her to stop that. And tori will say one thing and do another. Personally I don't know much about the situation in general and I can only go so much by what people tell me.

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:22pm EST
But I was talking to aja after cause tori left with Priscilla who apparently isn't a very good influence herself. And aja said she could try to talk to her but idk if she's gonna or anything. But I think she'd be easier for tori to relate to.

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:23pm EST
Whatever tori is doing now isn't working though. I mean she's aware of what she's doing to herself. But I think also in an attempt to cope she's making herself even worse.

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:23pm EST
priscilla isn't a bad influence but she isn't really posotive either

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:26pm EST
I don't talk to Priscilla cause I don't really know her. Aja was talkin about that though. How she's quite a drinker herself and how she won't really try to stop you from doing something. I don't remember her saying she necessarily encourages you. But you know. It was really depressing though cause while tori was trynna explain everything she's like. I guess it's kind of hard for someone to care about you if you don't even care about yourself.

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:26pm EST
very

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:27pm EST
tori has been texting me a lot lately

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:27pm EST
she's nice in words but the stories she tells make me worried about her

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:30pm EST
I just wish I could actually like. Do something to help her. But I don't ever really know anything to say or what to do other than just be there for someone. That's the worst part about it. Like. She isn't a bad kid. Like I mean if you take away all theshit she does and whatever. Kinda like she's not supposed to be like that. Do you know what I mean? Idk how to explain it. but yeah I am worried.

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:32pm EST
its worse because i've never actually seen the things she's done

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:32pm EST
like she shopwed up at my house a week or so back

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:32pm EST
at 1 am

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:33pm EST
my mom didn't wake me up

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:33pm EST
and asked tori if she needed help

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:34pm EST
tori left wandering around

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:34pm EST
ended up in a counselours house ssome how

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:35pm EST
idk

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:36pm EST
Oh god

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:37pm EST
Idk. She needs something though.

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:44pm EST
blegh

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
anywqay

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:47pm EST

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:50pm EST
Same deal. I don't like the blue in this. Im hoping it'll look better once I go over it with a blending market

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:51pm EST
Market

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:51pm EST

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 8:56pm EST
So yep

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
haha this mini netbook took 15 minutes to loaqd the awesomeness of those pics

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:08pm EST
the lnely one looks really cool

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:09pm EST
:D that one took the shortest time ever. I kinda wanna redo it and make the color lines get straighter as they go to the left and take the shape of the person as you go more towards the right

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:09pm EST
what is the explanation for the rest

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:09pm EST
But well see. Cause I kinda like how the person came out

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:10pm EST
The arrow one is confusion. Even though it doesn't look much like it. Just looks kinda weird lol

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:10pm EST
The other is like a lava lamp person haha. That's my calm and relaxation one. Cause I feel calm and relaxed when I stare at lava lamps

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:11pm EST
Which is what I was doing at 2am when I came up with the idea

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:24pm EST
Ahh those more sense. The clown one creeps me out

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:25pm EST
What

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:26pm EST
The one the eyes and the mouth

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:26pm EST
Oohhh

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:28pm EST
Yeah but I can see all of those ideas now

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:31pm EST
Sweet. Yeah now I gotta think up 4 more ideas. And I think imma try to do em on paper the size of the lava lamp person cause it's small so it'll take less time

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:31pm EST
makes sense

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:35pm EST
Just haven't gotten that far yet lol

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:36pm EST
so you still need 4 ideas?

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:36pm EST
Which is bad since its already 9:30. What other emotions/feelings

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:36pm EST
ughh sickness

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:37pm EST
So you vomiting

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:37pm EST
Got it

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:37pm EST
Three to go

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:37pm EST
it'll be beautiful

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:37pm EST
hmm guardianship

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:37pm EST
like protection

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:37pm EST
watching over someone

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:37pm EST
I wanna do anger for one still FFFFFFFF. My heart one still needs a background. IDw give it one

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:37pm EST
you get the idea

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:37pm EST
ddo it and stop your complainin

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:38pm EST
did you do the serenity one yet?

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:38pm EST
peaceful; object in a raging environment

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:38pm EST
Actually a picture popped into my head yesterday of someone vomiting like spikey balls. Like that are at the end of a ball and chain weapon thing yk. Idk why tho No I didn't I tried and nothing was working out

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:39pm EST
what did you try drawing?

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:39pm EST
I like the heart one without a background though. I mean do I really *need* one

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:39pm EST
A few stupid things like the first idea I told you about the meditating whatever. Then I tried to draw a person into a flowy tree thing But No

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:43pm EST
hmm

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:43pm EST
did you try doing some kind of animal instead?

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:43pm EST
deer, bird, cat etc

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:43pm EST
Needs to be people

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:44pm EST
ughh

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:44pm EST
its a symbol

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:45pm EST
Serenity is the last thing I'm worried about bc I just did one having to deal with calmness and such

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
ahh

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
i see

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
ignore that one then

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
Anger I'll think of something for. Something that doesn't involve fire

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
don't want to be cliche?

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:47pm EST
Yep

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:47pm EST
have you thought of bottled anger?

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:47pm EST
like the kind oeople hold inside till they explode?

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:48pm EST
that would be more interesting

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:50pm EST
It's a shame I don't have paint. Cause I could do a person shown from the side and do something exploding out of it. Or i could do like a person with their skin peeling to reveal some angry looking thing and looking just normal on the outside

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
both of those work

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
i thought very literraly of somehow involving a bottle

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:52pm EST
I I did too at first actually

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:52pm EST
But I didn't develop an actual idea out of it

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:52pm EST
i just thought of a little ship in a bottle

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:52pm EST
which is irrelevant

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:52pm EST
except...

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:53pm EST
An angry monster trying to break outta the. Otter

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:53pm EST
P

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:53pm EST
Otter yeah

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:53pm EST
Bottle

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:53pm EST
Is what I thought of

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:53pm EST
stormy seas inside the bottle, held by a guy on a boat

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:53pm EST
kinda the opposite of that serenity one i thought of

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:54pm EST
too much detail i think

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:54pm EST
If I had enough time

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:54pm EST
I would try that

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:54pm EST
Cause that's a cool idea

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:55pm EST
Id have whatever's in the bottle escape though

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:55pm EST
I'd want to rather

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:55pm EST
yeah like it's cracked open with the storm rushing out

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:55pm EST
but better idea you have?

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:56pm EST
L

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:56pm EST
Not l

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 9:58pm EST
If cracked then rushing out the top of the bottle almost like a bomb just exploded. With dark purple storm clouds. And then like not cracked just like the cork was taken out and it was flowing out the neck of the bottle and whatnot. Tht reminds me of a genie bottle

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:00pm EST
i can see it

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:01pm EST
GAH I wish I had time to try that

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:02pm EST
so you need the simplest of simple to draw?

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:02pm EST
thats impossible because you hate simple

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:02pm EST
Not simple really

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:02pm EST
Just something that'd still be effective on a smaller piece of paper

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:02pm EST
just not detailed?

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:03pm EST
Detailed but it doesn't have to be to my usual extent

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:03pm EST
Like the lava lamp one still has a design aspect in it

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:03pm EST
And Im doing more with the color in the background

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:03pm EST
But it's not completely simple and not unlike something I'd do

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:04pm EST
so more design type peices

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:04pm EST
with patterns and colors to represent ideas

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:05pm EST
Which is generally what I do lol. Just at a smaller scale

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:05pm EST
I'm working on exactly half the size paper as normal

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
i'm still trying to think of a way to make guardianship work

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:08pm EST
I feel like that requires a bit of a situation

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:08pm EST
yeah i know which is why i keep trying to imagine protective symboils

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
armor, shells, walls

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
That makes me think of The guardian of ancient kings ability in wow various Pokemon and turtles And one of mr pecks force diagrams

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
Those words.like without thinking

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
Not that that's relevant

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:17pm EST
idk, just idea throwing

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:17pm EST
but when you said pokemon i thiough of eggs

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
which made me think of like fetuses

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
and how their protected by parent

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
its cliche

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
but you might do something with it

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:32pm EST
good night, good luck

Steph DudakTuesday, January 3, 2012 at 10:32pm EST
Thanks, goodnight

Steph DudakWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 8:23pm EST
you aren't there. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT SUCKS? I'll tell you anyway. writing ~personal statements~. for my RPI app: Write a personal statement, in 250 words or more, about yourself ... be as creative as you like. just sayin. but my njit app is officially complete yaaay~ hope your day was just as fantastic

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:17pm EST
you finished it?!

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:17pm EST
funfun

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:17pm EST
and I'm never here

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:17pm EST
too many things to ignore and facebook makes me remember to do them

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:18pm EST
like freakin scholarships government garbage

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:18pm EST
I need to get on that

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:22pm EST
also before i forget

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:22pm EST
Eyes

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:22pm EST
I need to find cool ones

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:23pm EST
so far I've thought owls, cuttlefish, frogs, giant squid

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:23pm EST
any other ideas?

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:23pm EST
like cool cartoon eyes or something? I only know animals so that's why it's all I have

Steph DudakWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:24pm EST
Oh I was gonna say husky

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:35pm EST
mmhm

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:35pm EST
tthat was considered

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:35pm EST
but huskies are mainly cool because of the colors in their eyes which are really nice, but in order to get that effect they have, I'd need to be able to create that color

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:36pm EST
which with Art II supplies

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:36pm EST
is not the simpleest task in the world

Steph DudakWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:37pm EST
Depends what you're usin

Steph DudakWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:37pm EST
If you useeee acrylic maybe

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:41pm EST
maybe, I can mix paint pretty well, but I think I'd rather use that medium for something with more... vibrant? clashing? just more colors in general

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:42pm EST
huskies just have that ice blue

Steph DudakWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:53pm EST
Yeah but of you do it right it'll come out real nice. But if you rajther it for a more vibrant section

Steph DudakWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:53pm EST
Um

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:53pm EST
i can do more than one acryllic

Steph DudakWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:53pm EST
Do you know all the ones you want to use? Can you?

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:54pm EST
pretty sure, i mean dishon won't like it, but i do what i want in that class, since I don't suck he's pretty much like yeah sure whatever you feel is best

Steph DudakWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:55pm EST
Lol we had to use a different medium for each thing. Is it that same project as last year or?

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:59pm EST
we are doing detailed eyes, sketched eyeS, then a bunch of random eyes in different mediums of our choice, then a sort of final project of very detailed eyes, then 3 eyes of our choice

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 4, 2012 at 11:59pm EST
as far as i know

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:00am EST
So the final project. Is your own human eyes. In pencil Followed by 3 others. in whatever

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:01am EST
mhmm

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:02am EST
So what other three did you want to do then?

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:05am EST
i haven't decided I am going to try all the animals along with any cool eyes i find on google

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:05am EST
then pick from the ones i like best

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:05am EST
because we finally get to make a rough draft then a final copy

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:06am EST
we haven't done that at all so far

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:08am EST
Well that's good then. That way at least you'll get a good idea of what you can do. Have you thought much about mediums yet?

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:08am EST
not at all

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:08am EST
until you mention acryllic husky

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:09am EST
The only thing is

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:09am EST
i'll definately have a coloured pencil because coloured pencils are godly

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:09am EST
god damn it definitely*

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:09am EST
You'd need to make the fur look like fur

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:09am EST
Colored pencils are wonderful

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:10am EST
All I use rofl. I want markers. Then I'll learn how to use em. Um. There's tempera too

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:10am EST
What have you used so far?

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:11am EST
in class we've done tempera paint for the portrait, normal pencil, coloured pencil, those stupid crayon smeary things that i despise, umm i think that's it really

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:11am EST
If I ask I could get him to let me use other mediums

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:11am EST
if i can think of any

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:11am EST
paper cutout?

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:12am EST
those are fun

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:12am EST
I like those

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:12am EST
Cray-pas womp h8 em

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:13am EST
I used those for my wolf though

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:13am EST
those are the less smeary chalk crayon things right?

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:13am EST
Pain in the ass. I never learn

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:13am EST
They're like crayons

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:13am EST
But softer

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:13am EST
More pastely

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:14am EST
Hence Cray pas

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:14am EST
Not chalky

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:14am EST
alright

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:14am EST
i see google showed me they're close to what i thought they were

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:14am EST
Cause they're like they're oil pastels

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:16am EST
I wonder if I coiuld use some kind of chalk?

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:17am EST
meh i really don't like chalk so i don't see why it matter nevermind

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:18am EST
Not fun for eyes

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:18am EST
eyes are really precise so it would be a nightmare

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:19am EST
Exactly. Chalk pastels are good for landscapes tho. Did you do that one yet?

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:19am EST
yeah i did an aurora borealis

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:20am EST
How'd it come out?

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:21am EST
meh, he didn't teach us how to use pastel so it's pretty...childish looking? idk just looks sloppy to me

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:22am EST
There isn't much to learn. Didn't he do a demonstration? lol

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:22am EST
i might've missed it i'm usually late to his class

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:22am EST
but he went over layering, like he does with every new item we used

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:23am EST
but the colours mixed terribly

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:23am EST
so i just made them all solid mostly

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:24am EST
Takes some practice I think. They can be a pain but something like that seems like it'd be perfect for chalk pastels

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:24am EST
It sounds like a good idea anyway. But it always does

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:25am EST
yeah that's the problem he didn't really let us practice, I understood the idea of how to use them about halfway through the piece, but our first try was final copy

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:25am EST
ALSO

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:25am EST
the DAY after I bring in my photo

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:25am EST
liek THIRTY damn people start doing auroras

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:25am EST
uncreative bastards

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:25am EST
think up your own genius ideas

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:26am EST
Ugh annoying

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:26am EST
Was yours just plain greens and such?

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:26am EST
mostly greens and yellows

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:27am EST
the aurora itself i can stand, but everything else is just messy and dirty and looks bad

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:28am EST
http://coolyourjetsyo.tumblr.com/tagged/northern+lights Yeah I gotcha

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:28am EST
Lol gotchu is in my auto correct

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:29am EST
that looks sweet as hell

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:29am EST
oh there's more

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:29am EST
Could've sworn I had more tagged but I guess not

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:29am EST
There's only like 5 there

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:30am EST
Either way they all look magnificent

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:31am EST
i used a screen cap from a video i liked

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:33am EST

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:33am EST

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 12:35am EST
g'night

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 7:58pm EST
Hey nick I have a question so when you return feel free to answer; What does this look like to you?

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
first stupid impression which means nothing

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
drooling mouth

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
once i actually looked at it then clicked on image creepy eye rolling in it socket oozing some bodily fluid

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
doesn't look like blood though

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
next though

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:10pm EST
some kind of empty darkness shown from behind a cutin half eyes

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:10pm EST
my writing is not doing too well, so many painful typos

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:15pm EST
btw you have no idea how proud of myself i am for answering within 1/2 an hour

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:24pm EST
I'm proud too I was expecting later

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:25pm EST
It's melting btw

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:25pm EST
But I think it'd be more effective in color

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:31pm EST
ahh I see, the melting makes sense, what is being left underneath the melting eyer?

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:43pm EST
What do you mean? All that black space is gonna be the inside of the eye socket. Which is why coloring would make that a little more obvious bc I can add in links and make it look more like an eye socket than whatever else.

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:44pm EST
And if that isn't what you meant please elaborate lol

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:45pm EST
So it will just be an empty eye socket

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:46pm EST
i didn't know if you just wanted like a hole into blackness of a literal eye socket or something behind the eye socket

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:46pm EST
blegh

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:46pm EST
eye socket--> melting eye

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
Oh I gotchu. Well I didnt really think that far into it yet. I just thought the idea of a melting eye was kinda cool

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
And just did a quick doodle of what it might look like

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:48pm EST
it is, and your quick doodle's need to stop putting me to shame

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:49pm EST
But I could put something in the eye socket. Subtly though yk. But that's dependent on the feeling I'm going for Which I also didn't attach to this yet. The first thing that comes to mind is like lifeless. Like it could work, but there'd also be more effective ways to portray that And should it be that then the eye socket would just be a black hole of nothing

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:49pm EST
& haha I'm sorry

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:50pm EST
Now all I can think of is awed hopelessness at the arbitrary nature of life

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:53pm EST
I was thinking about it and then like that saying how the eyes are windows into the soul or whatever came to mind. Like thinking of how I could tie it back to something basically soulless actually

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:57pm EST
and that showing the emptiness behind the windows of the soul show the true emptiness in the person themself?

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:58pm EST
Bam

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:58pm EST
Genius

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 8:59pm EST
You're good at getting to where I'm trying to go lmao

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 9:00pm EST
I'm writing intellectual spanish journals so my words are working better than usual today

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 9:02pm EST
Ohhh that's fun

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 9:03pm EST
except i can't speak spanish, but other than that it's only been taking ...6? yeah 6 hours to write almost nothing :)

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 9:03pm EST
I just realized I can write them in english then just rewrite in spanish with simpler phrasing and words

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 9:04pm EST
That's usually the easiest way to go

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 9:06pm EST
If I had realized this 5 hours ago I could have been playing minecraft by now

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 9:07pm EST
anyway, any other ideas of what will be on the despair/ hopelessness piece?

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 9:09pm EST
Well in making the eyes take up the majority of the paper, it's gonna be small like the lava lamp. Maybe smaller so there's not do much empty space cause I can only make the eyes so big

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 9:09pm EST
So in not entirely sure what else or how in gonna color the skin

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 9:10pm EST
/if im gonna have what's there of the face kinda fade into the background

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 9:10pm EST
I might do that actually

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 9:10pm EST
i feel like a hyper realistic one might work

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 9:10pm EST
except for that eye itself of course

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 9:11pm EST
Hm

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 10:00pm EST
You know the only problem with this is figuring out how to color it.

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 10:05pm EST
all i can think of is making it realistic, just having the melting eyes with nothingesss behind it be out of norm

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 10:05pm EST
normal skin tones and eye colors

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 10:06pm EST
or having a comic book style coloring with very solid colors

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 10:06pm EST
Well I was more referring to the actual eye. Like the white part. Course it'd have to have other colors in it. I'll have to add some grey and stuff I think. It's just odd

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 10:06pm EST
And the part that falls over the bottom of the eye especially

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
do you have some done so far?

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
so i can guess?

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
I colored the tear ducts pink ._. I can show you the drawing itself if you want

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
Which will get turned to a duller pink bc it's too bright

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 10:12pm EST
Here's one eye

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 10:12pm EST
Here's another

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 10:13pm EST
There isnt an actual face shape on the picture

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 10:15pm EST
What if I had the person all black too tho? Like had bright colors and like highlights where appropriate so certain things don't blend in. To kinda further the nothing. Dunno if that'd lose the message. Not that any normal person would be able to get the message through the picture alone even if it were colored completely normal

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
i don't think the person should be dark, then you would lose the contrast of darkness under eye

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
also if the eye is melting would the iris be all wobbly as well?

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 10:22pm EST
Yeah but I just needed like a placement idea. I didn't fix it yet

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 10:24pm EST
I guess the melted eye should be pretty opaque right? Cause im just thinking of it in terms of when it hits the tear ducts

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 10:25pm EST
the white part of eye should be opaque yeah

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 10:25pm EST
idk if that what you're asking though

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 10:26pm EST
What if I did the person in black and white though? Just plain old pencil and have the eyes in colored pencil? It's still gonna fade out on the sides. Like just so that it's like there's this cloud of a face yk what I mean? I don't want to draw an actual shape of a face Yeah it is

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 10:28pm EST
i like that idea

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 10:34pm EST
That'll make the dripping parts of the eye easier too like the outsides. Awesome. Off to work

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 10:34pm EST
have fun

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:26pm EST
Algjsofjalgbr

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:26pm EST
?

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:27pm EST
I'll show you

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:27pm EST
Waiting for it to send

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:28pm EST
Idt I should've colored it like this. But I could see it colored like this that's the thing. But idk how I'm gonna do the white parts

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:29pm EST
Laurie just suggested

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:29pm EST
That I have the irises melt off the bottom of the eye

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:31pm EST
No she said Woahhh. Just keep it with the melting irises. That is so cool I don't know what that means

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:31pm EST
But I can't just have thr irises melting off their face

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:32pm EST
do you have lines drawn for where the white is melting out of the eyes?

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:33pm EST
Yeah

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:34pm EST
Do you want me to send a closer picture? I realize you can't really see the pencil lines

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:35pm EST
here

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:36pm EST
http://i551.photobucket.com/albums/ii472/dravarian26/EYE.png

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:36pm EST
are you including the whit part and everything melting off as well?

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:37pm EST
is what I'm asking

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:37pm EST
or just the green because that is all i see

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:38pm EST
and black obviously

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:38pm EST
Yes. Right now I don't have any white underneath the iris but it's on the sides and stuff. That's why I asked if you wanted a closer up picture

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:39pm EST
okay i understand, well then don't you know like shading techniques and stuff to make it look shiny and wet?

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:39pm EST
If you amke the melted part look wet and liquidy

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:39pm EST
the white of the eye will stand out against the skin tones

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:39pm EST
which will be graphite

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:39pm EST
Should I do the white last then do you think

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:40pm EST
Shade in the face or whatever with pencil and do that afterward

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:41pm EST
It might be simpler that way

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:41pm EST
and won't drawing the white with a white coloured pencil do something to make it stand out? idk I'm not good at the how to draw parts

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:41pm EST
just the That's a cool idea part

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:43pm EST
Only a bit. You only see the white so much but against everything else it'll prob be fine

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:43pm EST
alright good

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:44pm EST
well I need to try and do homework, but my mind is not cooperating, that means i have to wake up early tomorrow to do it -.-

Steph DudakThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:44pm EST
The eye socket isn't workin much either womp. Oo good luck Nicholas

Nick DevlinThursday, January 5, 2012 at 11:45pm EST

Serendipity

Steph DudakFriday, January 6, 2012 at 2:05pm EST
so i was late to school today -.-

Nick DevlinFriday, January 6, 2012 at 2:05pm EST
that's unlucky

Nick DevlinFriday, January 6, 2012 at 2:05pm EST
wake up late?

Steph DudakFriday, January 6, 2012 at 2:06pm EST
yep. came in at 7:40. couldn't take my pre calc test and she wouldn't let me come in during my lab period to take it even though i told her i was doing absolutely NOTHING

Steph DudakFriday, January 6, 2012 at 2:06pm EST
so i have to take it monday. either go in early to take it or take it during class but if i take it during class i'll miss the lesson sooo

Nick DevlinFriday, January 6, 2012 at 2:06pm EST
well it gives you more time to study and ask what's on the test

Steph DudakFriday, January 6, 2012 at 2:12pm EST
yeah but i'm probably gonna get a make up test and those are usually more difficult. she gives us an outline before the test but yeah. on another note. did my critique today. some of the pieces didn't really fit together and i need to figure out what to actually do for this and how to make it so i'm not killing myself over it. like. calicch picked out the butterfly/hand one, the tear one, the lava lamp, and the confused~ one with the arrows saying like they kind of all fit together whereas the others kind of don't, but they're all good pieces individually. she said i should try to expand on those four that i did and tap into my ~own emotions and experiences and ~how i'd feel. cause those four show some sort of progression. and that instead of trying to put a concentration to a bunch of different pieces, try to focus on something and then go from there and then i'll possibly be less frustrated over it. so i kinda just need to lock in on something. when i initially tried to explain what i thought my concentration kinda was and she's like. "you can do better than that. you're smarter than that." i'm like dkgsklhjfh k. the good news is i have time though so i mean. i guess i need to sit down and think about it because my heads kind of all over the place </rant> sorry

Nick DevlinFriday, January 6, 2012 at 2:14pm EST
forgiven

Nick DevlinFriday, January 6, 2012 at 2:15pm EST
so based on those four what could a concentration be on?

Steph DudakFriday, January 6, 2012 at 2:24pm EST
i think i have problems sticking to one thing you know. like i'll have ideas for things. and it seems like they go together but they really kinda don't. i don't really know though. i mean okay if you think about what's really going on in them. The lava lamp one i still don't really know how to describe. it's kinda really just my own contentness. the confusion one is kinda just what i picture when i think of confusion. it was funny cause calicch said when she looked at it. she described it as like. "the person knows something but they don't know if they should tell or not. like for example if your friends girlfriend is cheating on him, well do you tell him? you don't want em to think you're lying. and it's like these are wrapping around you making you unable to speak, you don't know what to do or where to go all confused and whatnot." so there's that. the tear one is self explanatory. then the arm and the butterfly showing a fragile person. i know i could like pull things from how i would feel personally. like think of my own experiences. and make the concentration relate to that kind of. a journey through my own head and emotions lol. calicch was like you are frustrated as hell with this. use that. aja HATED her concentration and she drew herself as this little ADD kid bothering her while she's trying to work on art. yadda yadda yadda. it's just an issue of thinking of something i can progress through and that's still interesting. and something that's like. that isn't going to make me frustrated after every piece and will allow things to kinda just come to me. like i said i gotta think about it really. something that'd make more sense but is specific and broad enough for me to work with

Nick DevlinFriday, January 6, 2012 at 4:34pm EST
i wish you good luck, tell me when you think of it, maybe i can help more then

Steph DudakSunday, January 8, 2012 at 12:00am EST
Guesssss what I'm watching right now

Steph DudakSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:02pm EST
Computer science stuff you should've started then lol

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:03pm EST
I was planning on doing the 2 smaller labs in class, which she told us to do

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:03pm EST
but

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:03pm EST
since she is not the brightest person with java we usually end up teaching her the lesson

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:03pm EST
which takes 10X longer

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:04pm EST
so there is no time in class

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:04pm EST
imagine if i hadn't gotten java by now o.o I'd have to handwrite this shit...

Steph DudakSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:05pm EST
That'd be awful o.o

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:08pm EST
but anyway while i copy justin's source code

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:08pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:11pm EST
Nopppe. Actually I could ask Steph. But it doesn't matter I already basically know what's going to be on it.

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:11pm EST
do you know how to do what's on it?

Steph DudakSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:12pm EST
For the most part

Steph DudakSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:12pm EST
But to be honest

Steph DudakSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:13pm EST
I can completely bomb this test and still be fine for the marking period

Steph DudakSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:13pm EST
Im not too worried about it

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:15pm EST
lucky

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:15pm EST
nah that's just silly

Steph DudakSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:26pm EST
Hahaha

Steph DudakSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:26pm EST
Math is just easy

Steph DudakSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:26pm EST
Physics on the other hand

Steph DudakSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:27pm EST
I have a test Tuesday and I don't even know how to do half the hw questions. I probably have like a c average in there

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:27pm EST
blegh annoying

Steph DudakSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:27pm EST
And I need a good grade on this test

Steph DudakSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:27pm EST
I also need to get going on my labs

Steph DudakSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:27pm EST
That'll help my grade too

Steph DudakSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:29pm EST
If I get an 85 on this test and a 93 on my lab notebook, I'll have a 79.5 and that's just through tests. Not including the couple hw assignments we've had and the extra credit I've done

Steph DudakSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:29pm EST
Basically I'll just pull off a B this marking period hopefully

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:29pm EST
there's that math thing helping you out again

Steph DudakSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:30pm EST
See the funny thing is. All physics is, is math. But I can't seem to apply it in there

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:30pm EST
most science math subjects annoy me like that

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:30pm EST
i can do theoretical math well

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:30pm EST
and theoretical science well

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:31pm EST
but when you mix the together for theoretical situations

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:31pm EST
i completely screw up

Steph DudakSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:32pm EST
not fun

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:32pm EST
my definition of chem last year

Steph DudakSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:33pm EST
lol chemistry. i don't even know how i did anything in there

Steph DudakSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:33pm EST
i got an A on the final it was amazing

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:33pm EST
i wonder what i got

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:34pm EST
nevermind i don't need to

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:34pm EST
transcript is next to me

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:34pm EST
well overall i got a b

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:34pm EST
so no clue what that means

Steph DudakSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:34pm EST
i like how many tests i did awful on. and mrs applegate was like. i know you can do better than this and i know you're trying so hard

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:45pm EST
yeah she's nice

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:45pm EST
idk why every complains about her

Steph DudakSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:46pm EST
they complain cause she kinda can't teach. like a full class. she's a genius but she's not that good at actually bringing that out to everyone. one on one i think she's fine though. but i love mrs applegate. and i had her write a recommendation for me and RPI has a specific form. i went to her like 4 times going back bc i kept messing shit up and she was so cool about it and was like yeah i'll get this done and mail it out! (cause she's gotta mail it) i was like sklgsklh thank youuu

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:47pm EST
i can't think of a single class with more than 20 student where I thought the teacher could convey their abilities well

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:47pm EST
marotto came close though

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:48pm EST
she taught me things, which is kind of unusual for a teacher to do

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:48pm EST
usually its like the teacher introduces and concept which you stare at till you figure out

Nick DevlinSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:49pm EST
she actually got people to figure out the concept from the things she said

Steph DudakSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:49pm EST
dziedzic. seriously i feel like she makes things so easy and it makes so much sense when she does things on the board and everything. i can't talk for a full class but she's a great teacher

Steph DudakSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:50pm EST
she originally majored in physics actually

Steph DudakSunday, January 8, 2012 at 4:52pm EST
i like when i actually learn things from teachers. you're right that's actually not a very common occurance lol

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 4:31pm EST
NICK

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 4:31pm EST

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 4:37pm EST
i mean

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 4:37pm EST
there's a black spot on it omg. it doesn't matter. but anyway what if i did a background like this or something http://i39.tinypic.com/wltzzn.png

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 4:37pm EST
well it'll be super big for you

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 4:37pm EST
That it is

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 4:37pm EST
1599x1142

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 4:37pm EST
and it looks amazing

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 4:38pm EST
you can finally use all the super specific line making we learn in graphic design

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 4:39pm EST
i kinda wanna leave it like that & edit it on the computer or something. have the hand be smooth and such yk? not look so much like colored pencil. that's a lot of editing to do. and i didn't realize how little amount of art pieces i really have on hand

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 4:44pm EST
I think this piece would be great on the comp

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 4:44pm EST
i should start getting back into this

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 4:44pm EST
you can add little details like reflectiveness

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 4:44pm EST
and you should

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 4:44pm EST
yk kinda sketching it out and filling it in on ps

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 4:44pm EST
so should i actually

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 4:49pm EST
yes you should

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 4:49pm EST
this will take some time

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 4:54pm EST
should i go back & try to do that sunburst with colored pencils do you think? so it's consistent?

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 4:54pm EST
like i can eventually go back in photoshop over the arm when i actually have hours to spend doing that

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 4:54pm EST
if you want to bacround it

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 4:54pm EST
yeah try to be consistant

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 4:55pm EST
unless you can completely do it online

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 4:55pm EST
right now i can't. i need to work on some more things just to stick in a portfolio for rpi

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 4:56pm EST
most of this stuff is gonna go in it, but i just gotta touch em up a tad, give em backgrounds and such. gotta go over the blue one with my blender lol

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 5:03pm EST
are you like fixing all of them for portfolio?

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 5:05pm EST
the ones i want in there yeah. like the tear one, some of it is just too light. the marker was running out when i was going over it i think. so it just needs to be blended a little more. so i'm gonna get that done, & draw up some other things. i might put one of my sharpie things in there, just to add another thing, show things i've done just using lines and patterns and stuff.

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 5:05pm EST
you have sharpie stuf?!

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 5:05pm EST
like what?

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 5:08pm EST
just those silly doodle-ish things i do. the one i put in my portfolio to get into ap art. i might try to do another and try to make it into something though yk

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 5:09pm EST
plus i do those on smaller paper. so it'll take less time once i have an idea going

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 5:10pm EST
i never saw those

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 5:11pm EST
you've seen the sharpie doodle that i put in my portfolio for ap art last year. i worked on it like the last few days of school basically lol

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 5:35pm EST
i hate when people go and try to take credit off an image someone makes, so they have to go and stick the watermark across the entire image to prevent it. shame really

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 5:36pm EST
can't really blame them

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 5:36pm EST
but i understand

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 5:36pm EST
if you love soething that much email the creator

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 5:37pm EST
no i know. i'm just saying. when i go to look at something it obscures my view and it's distracting, but it can't be helped unless i go to buy the print lol. i understand why they do it and i'd do the same if i were in the position

That should be my art concentration rofl Thats so fun

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 11:23pm EST
i can think of many ideas

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 11:24pm EST
but more tumblr worthy than really college level

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 11:24pm EST
back to what it reminds me of

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 11:24pm EST
I thought of non suckish ideas for the art thing

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
Oh did you? Btw I tried to draw princess tiana. One half of her face looked good and then it went downhill lol

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
aww, disney characters are impossible for me to draw

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
they're like defined by their proportions

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 11:26pm EST
and i suck at proportions

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 11:26pm EST
I wish I had Laurie's talent of drawing fantastic Disney characters

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 11:26pm EST
she is really good

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 11:27pm EST
Tiana is one of my favorite princesses now, did you know that? Idk why. I think it's cause the green dress she wears in the forest wedding is really pretty. Black people look good in that color green

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 11:27pm EST
That was such a good movie

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 11:27pm EST

Aurora is my second favorite princess. No third. I'd totally name my kid aurora. Well maybe not. But I'd want to.

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 11:32pm EST

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 11:33pm EST

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 11:34pm EST

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 11:34pm EST
Maleficent

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 11:34pm EST
Idk whatever yk who I'm talking about

Nick DevlinFriday, January 13, 2012 at 11:34pm EST
aurora would be a good middle name

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 11:34pm EST
It would be. Depending on the first name

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 11:34pm EST
Which would have to be really awesome too

Steph DudakFriday, January 13, 2012 at 11:36pm EST
New goal in life~ have a kid, make her middle name aurora.

Nick DevlinSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 5:39pm EST
right now i am paying fee to montclair

Steph DudakSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 5:41pm EST
good i hope mrs applegate mailed out that recommendation and my application fee for rpi went through. i don't like this whole applying to college thing

Nick DevlinSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 5:43pm EST
i don't think anyone does

Nick DevlinSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 5:43pm EST
its one of the worste processes I've ever gone through

Nick DevlinSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 5:43pm EST
and you can go ask guidance which letters you have

Steph DudakSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 5:45pm EST
no

Steph DudakSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 5:45pm EST
mrs applegate had to do it herself

Nick DevlinSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 5:45pm EST
ohhh

Nick DevlinSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 5:45pm EST
why?

Steph DudakSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 5:47pm EST
my applications for RPI & NJIT, everything needs to be submitted online. transcripts and everything cause it's sendedu or whatever. but my recommendation for RPI, it was a specific paper that came with the application thing that i had to print out and give to mrs applegate, and she has to mail it or fax it to them. i couldn't use my recommendation from bach for NJIT either unless it was done online either? i didn't need a recommendation for NJIT tho. so i'm doing my next two applications on common app that way i can just get everything sent out and i don't have any issues or anything. it's a pain in the ass.

Nick DevlinSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 5:50pm EST
very much so

Nick DevlinSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 5:50pm EST
I've just paid $30 to send out SAT scores

Nick DevlinSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 5:50pm EST

Steph DudakSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 5:51pm EST

Steph DudakSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 5:52pm EST

Steph DudakSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 5:53pm EST

Nick DevlinSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 5:54pm EST

Nick DevlinSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 5:54pm EST

Nick DevlinSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 5:54pm EST

Nick DevlinSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 5:55pm EST

Nick DevlinSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 5:55pm EST
or at least email someone

Steph DudakSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 5:57pm EST
it's right on the application though

Steph DudakSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 5:57pm EST
it's just the password for the status of the application

Steph DudakSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 6:31pm EST

Nick DevlinSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 6:40pm EST

Nick DevlinSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 6:40pm EST
which I didn't understand

Steph DudakSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 6:41pm EST
cause i don't feel like doing it right now

Steph DudakSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 6:41pm EST
i'm workin on the actual eyes. the eyebrows will take two minutes to fix up one and reflect it over

Steph DudakSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 6:41pm EST
so it's the last thing i'm worried about

Nick DevlinSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 6:41pm EST
sense has been made

Steph DudakSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 6:41pm EST
i was just pointing out it was off bc it was something i noticed

Nick DevlinSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 6:45pm EST

Nick DevlinSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 7:19pm EST
i heard your tone

Steph DudakSaturday, January 14, 2012 at 7:20pm EST
lolol

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 2:36pm EST
NICHOLAS. you did that colored pencil project right? with the 6 squares? do you remember what each square had to be? like the techniques used? i know graphite, just regular coloring, cross-hatch, stippling, color one way... but idk what the other one was. it's second to last on my spyro thing and i can't for the life of me think of what it is cause it just looks colored normally.

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:04pm EST
burnishing?

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:05pm EST
it was graphite, coloured pencil, stippling, crosshatching, burnishing, then random design of whatever style you pleased which meant make a random pattern

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:06pm EST
burnishing was when you smoothed out the colours you had with a light colour, usually yellow or white

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:06pm EST
it made it kind of waxy looking but the colours were much smoother

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:08pm EST
it was my favourite style we did

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:14pm EST
so i've heped you

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:14pm EST
Now I have a question

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:15pm EST
I decided one of my eyes is going to be an animal native to North America with a dream catcher for its eye

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:16pm EST
Bobcat, bald eagle, American bison, American alligator, eastern diamondback rattlesnake, elk, American black bear, woodchuck (also called groundhog), mountain beaver, American beaver, North American porcupine, Canadian lynx, coyote, kit fox, swift fox, common raccoon, black-footed ferret, fisher, American badger, striped skunk, North American river otter, mule deer, pronghorn.

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:16pm EST
I didn't exlude any even though there are some i know i won't do

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:16pm EST
Any of those stand out to you?

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:17pm EST
I'm doing this in coloured pencil obviously because i want it very detailed

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:17pm EST
i am imagining dark blues and purples for the overall colour

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:19pm EST
One sec

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:22pm EST
Coyote, American lynx, What's a pronghorn?

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:23pm EST
deer type thing

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:23pm EST
Picture?

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:24pm EST
Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:24pm EST
Coyote

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:24pm EST
Or

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:25pm EST
Bald eagle

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:27pm EST
my favourites were bison, bear. eagle, and badger

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:28pm EST
i liked ferret but they are too small to put a dreamcatcheras it's eye and zooming in on the face wouldn't leave enough detail to tell what it was

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:32pm EST
I'd def go with eagle then

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:34pm EST
yeah i think you're right, bear and badger both seem annoying

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:35pm EST
buffalo i think might work still and kind of want to try it

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:35pm EST
but eagles have really round eyes that would work well

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:37pm EST
You could try em both like on regular paper n see what you like better

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:37pm EST
i think i will be doing that

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:40pm EST
Always a good idea

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:43pm EST
was burnishing what you were asking about btw?

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:43pm EST
or was it some other style

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:45pm EST
I don't think so. I still don't know what it was though. I'll show you when I'm home cause I scanned it and took out the "cross hatching" one

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:45pm EST
It looks colored normally, just with different colors

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:47pm EST
no clue then, sorry. maybe he did something different that year?

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:48pm EST
I think he did. I just wish I remembered what x.x. Cause he didn't have us write what technique it was under it. He was like nah

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 4:49pm EST
just bring it in and ask him

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:34pm EST
is today an important game?

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:34pm EST
of course!

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:34pm EST
XD

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:34pm EST
why?

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:34pm EST
it's the playoffs

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:34pm EST
you lose, you're out

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:34pm EST
ahh

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:35pm EST
understanding has fallen upon me

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:35pm EST
still don't care

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:35pm EST
but at least i know

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:35pm EST
didn't think so but yeah it's good to know lol

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:35pm EST
you like thegiants right?

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:35pm EST
they winning?

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:36pm EST
yep yep!

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:36pm EST
last time i checked they were

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:36pm EST
funfun

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:36pm EST
i'm writing lab stuff

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:36pm EST
apparently i have some incorrect data, but i'm not sure why it's incorrect

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:36pm EST
i think it's human error why the bullseye wasn't placed on the floor right

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:36pm EST
retest the experiment at home

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:36pm EST
setup a lab

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:36pm EST
it was supposed to be 74 cm over, we were 69.75, so 4.25 cm off

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:36pm EST
but

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:36pm EST
our calculations were wrong

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:37pm EST
bc we didn't convert to cm & such from meters

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:37pm EST
but

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:37pm EST
even when you convert it you still get 69.75 for where the bullseye should be placed

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:37pm EST
doesn't making mistakes give you more to write about though?

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:38pm EST
yes it does

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:38pm EST
so it makes you look smarter and you get more credit

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:38pm EST
i suppose in the experimental section, i'm gonna just write it all how we did it before we realized we had messed up data

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:38pm EST
well only if it happens occasionally

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:38pm EST
then the conclusion & error analysis i get to talk about all that other garbage

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:39pm EST
i actually included diagrams in this lab too

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:39pm EST
AND I WAS DOING SO GOOD OMG READY

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:39pm EST
dammnn

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:39pm EST
THE FIRST PAGE IS SO NEAT

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:39pm EST
THEN AT THE BOTTOM, THE LAST LINE ON THE BACK OF THAT PAGE, THERE'S A GIANT LINE OF CROSS OUT

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:40pm EST
I don't know if there is anything more, but I can imagine you completely freaking out then despairing for days when you did it

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:40pm EST
just because of that one line

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:41pm EST
you have to see it

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:41pm EST
i hate when that happens

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:41pm EST
and it always happens

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:41pm EST
always

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:42pm EST
which is why i never write when i can help it

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:42pm EST
always type

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 6:42pm EST
which might explain why i have so many errors when i writ

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 7:31pm EST
http://i298.photobucket.com/albums/mm269/xsynysterstephx/NotFinished/Hayley1.png & http://i298.photobucket.com/albums/mm269/xsynysterstephx/editedpics/editedpicrupertgrint1.png are what they're from. well the second before it was badly edited

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 7:37pm EST
btw, how does this http://i298.photobucket.com/albums/mm269/xsynysterstephx/School/ESGrades.png equal a 92...? doesn't matter now obv but yeah

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:24pm EST
well its a .929 so more like a 93 but yeah

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
and those photoshop things are interesting

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
i highly dislike Ron's typography, mostly because it's illegible

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
i'm debating on using one of them

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
but the overall design is cool

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
it wasn't on a white background

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
when i did it

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
like

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
when i used it

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:26pm EST
the yellow makes more sense then

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:26pm EST
but i think the riot one kind of looks a bit better

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:27pm EST
it does, and i can take my website out of it

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:27pm EST
then move the circles closer

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:27pm EST
or take em out completely

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:27pm EST
to remove the negative space

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:27pm EST
i like the circles

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:27pm EST
http://i39.tinypic.com/2m82r82.png

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:27pm EST
the circles

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:27pm EST
were the navigation

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:28pm EST
when i used it as a layout

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:28pm EST
if you hovered over em

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:28pm EST
put them on it then!

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:28pm EST
on the left side

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:28pm EST
it adds like a frame

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:29pm EST
and is white the background for this one?

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:29pm EST
yeah this one the background actually was white

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:30pm EST
the circles look weird without the website name lol

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:31pm EST
they dont have a purpose without it

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:32pm EST
and would it be weird if i submitted this like this http://i42.tinypic.com/bi0wpl.png cause i don't have anything straight enough to do that with colored pencil

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:32pm EST
my moms like yeah why not it looks good

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:32pm EST
but you know mothers

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:32pm EST
yeah i know

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:33pm EST
can you add an effect to the light?

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:33pm EST
make it more colured pencil texted

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:33pm EST
textured*

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:34pm EST
i tried to do that and nothing looked right

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:35pm EST
but i feel like the backgrounds too smooth to go with the colored pencil

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:35pm EST
and i can't edit the colored pencil part to look like that really

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:35pm EST
no, hmm

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:35pm EST
can you make the white background lik...off-white?

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:35pm EST
that might help

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:36pm EST
idk, most of my computer art is guess and check

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:36pm EST
i can try

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:36pm EST
well

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:36pm EST
making the white won't really do much lol

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:36pm EST
making the white off-white

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:36pm EST
i bet i don't have the psd for this either

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:37pm EST
and my scanner decided it no longer wants to let me scan things onto my computer

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:37pm EST
psd?

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:37pm EST
it's a file for photoshop that allows you to save a file with all the layers still there instead of merging them all into one

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:37pm EST
the brain project & the one with the heart i had to take pictures of. and they don't look very good

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:39pm EST
hmm how'd you take the pictures?

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:40pm EST
with a camera. but i took em like an hour or so ago. and there's no place in my house with good enough lighting

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:40pm EST
like i had to take a picture of my painting, sword, and slimy one

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:40pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:41pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:45pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:53pm EST
should i include a description for all of these? it says it's optional but

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:55pm EST
yes

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:55pm EST
i feel like you should

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:55pm EST
otherwise they might misinterperate

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:55pm EST
okie

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:55pm EST
or not get it

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:56pm EST
should i use these symbols

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:57pm EST
Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:57pm EST
the square ones at the bottom?

Nick DevlinSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:58pm EST
in my portfolio for graphic design?

Steph DudakSunday, January 15, 2012 at 11:59pm EST
the bottom left, above the aqua one, is that like. part of that whole series you got goin down there

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:00am EST
yeah it is

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:00am EST
the only reason there is multiple rows is just so i could look at different colours

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:01am EST
I really liked that blue so i didn't even try colours for the first

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:01am EST
i like all the blue/purple/orange/yellow ones

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:02am EST
the brighter ones really

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:02am EST
yeah they are all supposed to be symbols for elements

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:02am EST
they're interesting though

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:02am EST
like in general i like them all

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:03am EST
but the colors of some throw me off a bit

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:03am EST
id use em tho

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:03am EST
any ideas for better colours?

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:05am EST
i just typed out this whole thing til i realized what you did

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:05am EST
um

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:06am EST
hold on

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:06am EST
the third column. those colors stand out to me cause i like them together. maybe if you did those all in like. what's the word for it.

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:06am EST
it starts with an a

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:07am EST
i think

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:07am EST
well with colors next to each other on the color wheel

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:07am EST
anachronistic ?

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:07am EST
and then you can have like shades of whatever colors

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:07am EST
analagous

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:08am EST
if you pick like 2 or 3 colors yk

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:08am EST
YES

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:08am EST
that's the word

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:08am EST
derp

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:08am EST
yeah I do like how those colours looks together

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:08am EST
but it's like

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:08am EST
each of them symbolizes like light water air sound

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:09am EST
how would i fit having multiples of the same symbol

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:11am EST
here

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:12am EST
umm

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:12am EST
http://i551.photobucket.com/albums/ii472/dravarian26/ElementalSymbols.jpg

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:13am EST
so colors that represent those more like would be more effective, no?

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:13am EST
mhmm

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:14am EST
the colours I have on that last picture with the captions explaining the elements

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:14am EST
Is not the colours I like best, just the first row

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:15am EST
, cause I'm lazy

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:15am EST
yeah i gotcha

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:15am EST
um

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:15am EST
what exactly is light fire

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:16am EST
it's kind of all those elements mixed in one

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:16am EST
fire and light were assumed to be the same thing

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:16am EST
along with heat

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:17am EST
I have an intensive encyclopedia of this elemental thing

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:17am EST
there's a religion to go along with ti

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:17am EST
and a country

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:17am EST
and a world

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:17am EST
and a solor system...

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:17am EST
I was a vry bored child

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:17am EST
water i'd do a lighter blue. like #1ac3ed ish why that tan/brown color for earth and green for wood?

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:17am EST
that's pretty cool

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:18am EST
yeah why those

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:18am EST
i'd associate green with earth and brown with wood

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:18am EST
well Earth I associated with dirt

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:18am EST
and green i assocaited with leaves

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:18am EST
like when you look at a forest

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:18am EST
its mostly green

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:18am EST
yeah but

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:18am EST
that's the leaves

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:19am EST
if you have a square thats supposed to be WOOD

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:19am EST

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:19am EST

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:19am EST
#137c12 that green color tho, i like.

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:20am EST
#c3f2f0 - air

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:20am EST
idk how any of these look next to each other

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:20am EST
they look pretty nice alone though

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:20am EST
yeah the blue is a bit too light, but I do agree that my current blue is too dark

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:21am EST
and I just noticed the pattern when I zoom in on the wood

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:22am EST
#ad6eca / #8753a0 - celestial space #3c98e6 / #3584fa / #00a5e2 - water?

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:22am EST
just other suggestions

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:22am EST
i'm just not fond of the color you used for celestial space

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:22am EST
nor am i

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:22am EST
Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:23am EST
but here is what the colour for wood looks like super zoomed in

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:25am EST
oh wow

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:25am EST
all the colours have that kind of pattern

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:25am EST
you can't see when it's all zoomed out though

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:27am EST
did you put a texture on the squares

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:27am EST
like all of them

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:27am EST
some of them i can tell it's obviously not just a plain color

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:28am EST
even the black i used for the symbols aren't just one colour

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:29am EST
the only solid colour i have is the border

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:29am EST
for each symbol

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:33am EST
I'm gonna fix all the colours you said to change

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:33am EST
and sharpen the quality

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:33am EST
okie. i wanna seee after. like i said i dunno how good the colors actually look, they just look nice in the preview in photoshop.

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:34am EST
should i include the text?

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:35am EST
i wouldn't

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:35am EST
you said you're putting it in your portfolio?

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:35am EST
so i assume there'll be a spot for explanation?

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:44am EST
i didn't see any

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:44am EST
just the title and the medium

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:45am EST
that's annoying

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:45am EST
then yeah i'd put the names in then

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:45am EST
meh, most of my stuff doesn't need explination

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:45am EST
if there's no description

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:45am EST
area

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:45am EST
yeah you're right

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:45am EST
yeah but it's good to have if you do need it yk. i mean i guess they don't really care but yk

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:50am EST
yeah I'll include it anyway

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:50am EST
I'll end up spend more time on the text somehow anyway

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:54am EST
sound

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:54am EST
what colour is sound

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:54am EST
Pale yellow

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 12:55am EST
I'll try

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:01am EST
this is really annoying

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:01am EST
everytime i zoom it turns a completely different colour

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:02am EST
Why are you zooming in on if

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:06am EST
if?

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:07am EST
it

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:08am EST
iPod , can't type

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:09am EST
oh I'm zooming in and out to fix details

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:10am EST
and each different level of zoom is different colours

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:10am EST
but i realize 100% zoom is probly the colour it will end up being

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:13am EST
what colour did you say for wood?

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:13am EST
brown?

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:14am EST
blegh I really want a green brown

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:14am EST
but that just looks like puke

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:14am EST
what kind of brown?

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:14am EST
sepia, dark, reddish

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:14am EST
A dark reddish brown. Only very slightly red

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:15am EST
I'd send a color code but I shut my computer down for a bit

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:18am EST
I found one

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:20am EST
and greenish for wood?

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:20am EST
I mean earth*

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:20am EST
earth is greenish?

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:21am EST
Yes. Try the green I sent earlier n see how that looks

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:21am EST
I associate earth with green bc I associate them both with the earth kingdom

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:23am EST
I think of pokemon

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:23am EST
in which ground type is brown

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:32am EST
ugh is this the stuff you spend all night doing

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:32am EST
I can't stop

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:32am EST
worse than minecraft

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:33am EST
Isn't it awful sometimes lol

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:33am EST
I'm like half done

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:33am EST
but I can't decide a colour for metal

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:33am EST
goldish? silverish?

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:33am EST
Silverfish

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:33am EST
Yes

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:33am EST
Silverfish

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:34am EST
Silver USB

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:34am EST
YOU KNOW WHAT

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:34am EST
I'm not longer correcting myself

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:34am EST
You can figure out what this blasted device tells you I say

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:37am EST
yeah

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:37am EST
cause I knew silverfish

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:37am EST
meant silver usb

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:37am EST
no

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:38am EST
it didn't

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:38am EST
because i just said silverish

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:38am EST
so that's what you meant

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:38am EST
fuck yeah

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:38am EST
haha

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:40am EST
anyway any ideas for animals or light? I keep think a reddish colour for animals, either that or just deleting them entirely, I don't even like it's design really

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:43am EST
orange/red orange etc

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:43am EST
light uh

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:48am EST
light should be red/orange?

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:48am EST
no animals if youre including that

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:48am EST
although that's not an element really

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:48am EST
light um

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:48am EST
idk

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:48am EST
idk!

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:50am EST
PRESSURE STEPH PRESSURE

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:50am EST
Element is the easier word I could use to describe

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:50am EST
actually there is a branched off religion that agrees with you

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:50am EST
the believe that animal and wood should be stricken from the list

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:51am EST
along with fire/light being split

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:51am EST
another group wants to add magnetism as an element but there is arguement that magnetism is a force not an element

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:52am EST
which bring light and fire into question along with sound since they too are forces

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:52am EST
its a bit convulted

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:52am EST
well then lol

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:52am EST
as long as you don't call them elements

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:52am EST
because that just ruins me

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:52am EST
but i really have no clue what you can use for light rainbow idk

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:52am EST
I did make a word in my language, i forget what it was called though

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:52am EST
white

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:53am EST
white light?

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:55am EST

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:56am EST

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:58am EST

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:58am EST
and animal is getting deleted

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 1:59am EST
i like the orange in there though. like having the orange in the mix. you can't really put orange as light though. that's just silly. i dunno what else you can do for light

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 2:00am EST
ohh the order matters a bit ass well

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 2:00am EST
-.-

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 2:00am EST

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 2:01am EST

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 2:26am EST

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 2:27am EST

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 2:27am EST

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 6:59pm EST
the extra s is for stupendous i'm guessing

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 6:59pm EST
but it was great

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 6:59pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:00pm EST
stealing works

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:00pm EST
as long as you don't get caught

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:00pm EST
steph this is the internet

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:00pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:00pm EST
nick

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:00pm EST
i didn't even think of it like that

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:00pm EST
hahaha

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:01pm EST
at first i seriously pictured you stealing it from somewhere or someone

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:02pm EST
...

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:02pm EST
yeah

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:02pm EST
I can see that

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:02pm EST
actually i can

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:02pm EST
i have little to no conscience

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:03pm EST
XD

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:03pm EST
i spelled conscience correctly on my first try

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:03pm EST
i feel accomplished

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:05pm EST
con science

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:05pm EST
that's how i think of it when i write it

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:05pm EST
and

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:05pm EST
wed nes day

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:05pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:06pm EST
exactly

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:06pm EST
and i realized the con-science thing just as i wrote it

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:06pm EST
i can't think of any others off the top of my head

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:06pm EST
there's definitely more tho

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:06pm EST
i thank bruce almighty for the beautiful one

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:07pm EST
i remember definitely

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:07pm EST
by thinking of the oatmeal comic

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:08pm EST
if you you spell definitely with an a then you are definAtely and Ass hole

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:09pm EST
hahahahaha YESS

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:10pm EST
but others besides them i con't really think of

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:10pm EST
you're right about having tons of them though

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:11pm EST
still can't tell between affect and effect though

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:11pm EST
i think

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:11pm EST
i get it sometimes?

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:11pm EST
like affect is a verb...

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
something affects you there are effects of something

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
i usually guess

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
if i don't know i go with effect since I see it a lot more

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
so there is more chance of it being right

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:15pm EST
this is true

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:17pm EST
so cause of that my little pony link you posted, i'm now watching other ~teens react videos. omg

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:17pm EST
do you watch kids react?

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:18pm EST
they're great as well

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:18pm EST
raafi brothers are awesome

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:18pm EST
too bad all they are known for is the react videos

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:18pm EST
no i do not!

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:19pm EST
you should start watching them as well

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:19pm EST
the kids react videos as well

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:19pm EST
i'll get on that

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:20pm EST
eventually

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:20pm EST
whenever you do

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:20pm EST
you know what i should do, is learn how to make more time for myself so i can get to reading that book you let me borrow lol

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:20pm EST
i need to read that, i need to read kevin's book eian's like raaaawr you need to read hunger games !!!

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:20pm EST
hunger games can wait

Steph DudakMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:20pm EST
and i'm like skhfdhf I HAVE TO OTHER BOOKS TO READ STILL THEY TAKE PRIORITY OVER HUNGER GAMES

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:21pm EST
they can wait because that trilogy is boring compared to the series i gave you

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:21pm EST
well not really

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:22pm EST
hunger games is much more actiony

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:22pm EST
but action in books bores me

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:22pm EST
that's what movies are for

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:22pm EST
the plot is still good though

Nick DevlinMonday, January 16, 2012 at 7:22pm EST
anyway

Steph DudakTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 9:19pm EST
not to mention it's no one elses business, and the fact that they're all making threats is juvenile and senseless.

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 9:19pm EST
that's unusual

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 9:19pm EST

Yes

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 9:27pm EST
waive your access

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 9:28pm EST

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 9:29pm EST

Steph DudakTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 9:29pm EST
You must enter one Counselor (who will complete the School Report and other forms for you) and at least one Teacher (who will complete the Teacher Evaluation for you.) You may enter an unlimited number of teachers and assign them to any colleges you'd like, but only one Counselor may be invited. Fields with a yellow dot are required and must be filled in prior to submission of this form. To ensure your information is saved, please click the ‘Save’ button at the bottom of the page. After saving, those school officials with email addresses will receive an email inviting them to send your recommendations online or via mail, whichever they prefer. If any of your school officials choose to mail their forms, you will need to return to this website to print paper forms for them to mail.

Steph DudakTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
I affirm that I will send an enrollment deposit (or equivalent) to only one institution; sending multiple deposits (or equivalent) may result in the withdrawal of my admission offers from all institutions. [Note: students may send an enrollment deposit (or equivalent) to a second institution where they have been admitted from the waitlist, provided that they inform the first institution that they will no longer be enrolling.]

Steph DudakTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:10pm EST

then they are actually responsible for doing shit

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:29pm EST

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:38pm EST
then again

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:39pm EST

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
which is a tad odd

Steph DudakTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
no i asked you a few days ago

Steph DudakTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
like last week

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:39pm EST

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
thus my silly joke

Steph DudakTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
it's just like a reflex for me to ask if a book is good when someone tells me theyre reading something

Steph DudakTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
ha

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:40pm EST

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:40pm EST
its been so long since i've read a meaningless fantasy novel

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:41pm EST
just dragons and magic and generic morals/ metaphors

Steph DudakTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:43pm EST
at least you're reading something

Steph DudakTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:43pm EST

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
i should be reading spanish subjugation sentence

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
you know what's worse than bombing a test?

Steph DudakTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
no

Steph DudakTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
bombing

Steph DudakTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
stuff in general

Steph DudakTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
like buildings

Steph DudakTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
and stuff

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
although that is true

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
it is not not nearly as self-centered as i was looking for

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
unless i was in the building of course

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
at the beginning of the year with my first spanish test

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
i thought it was bombing a test for the first time

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
but i was wrong

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:47pm EST
today i though bombing every test and quiz you've taken in a class was the worst

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:47pm EST
still wrong

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:47pm EST
i have realized that continually having hope that you might to better this time

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:47pm EST
then being incorrect in that belief

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:47pm EST
that is the worst

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:47pm EST
that i have discovered so far

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:48pm EST
not only tha

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:48pm EST
but being unable to tell whether or not you are going to fail after you take it

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:48pm EST
I thought I would get a B

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:48pm EST
I failed

Steph DudakTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
why don't you drop spanish?

Steph DudakTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
if you're doing that badly. i mean do you even like it?

Steph DudakTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
if i even just read all that right

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
oh you did

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
but

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
i just...

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
can't

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
as much as i despise taking tests

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
i still answer question in class correctly

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
i still help the other people

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
but it's like on the tests

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
i get stpid mistake after stupid mistake after stupid mistake

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:51pm EST
and i'm the last person t o turn in the test because i go over it like 5 times

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:51pm EST
so idk

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:51pm EST
blegh

Steph DudakTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:51pm EST
don't treat your tests like a test then. look at your test like classwork or homework. or idk something you do decent on. i mean you know what you're doing, you just need to figure out a way to apply it to other things. tests in language classes are weird though i

Steph DudakTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:51pm EST
ll give you that

Steph DudakTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:52pm EST
everythings always easier said than done do you look over your stuff before you take the tests

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:53pm EST
yep

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:53pm EST
even been studying

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:53pm EST
as much as i know how

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:53pm EST
but its not like i get the homework right

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:53pm EST
they all have stupid errrors as well

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:54pm EST
it's just that i can find them and correct them as we're talking

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:54pm EST
I feel like a 3rd grader shoved up 5 grades

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:55pm EST
i want to move to mexico for a month

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:55pm EST
not speak english at all then come back

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:55pm EST
maybe i'll be able to pass then

Steph DudakTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:56pm EST
Get Antonio to tutor you

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:56pm EST

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:56pm EST

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:56pm EST
he speaks street

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:56pm EST
he doesn't even realize how he talks

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:57pm EST
and is only doing better than me because of vocab and general knowledge of how things sound

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:57pm EST
like "that just sounds weird"

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:57pm EST
he doesn't know why

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:57pm EST
it just does

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:58pm EST
not helpful to stufy with

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 10:58pm EST
i know how to fix these problem i just want to complain

Steph DudakTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 11:01pm EST
Well I'm good for that. I'd offer to help but once again, incapable

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 11:03pm EST
once again highly appreciated but not much to do about it, might as well complain about my lack of extra appendages in which to juggle.

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 11:03pm EST
just as useless

Steph DudakTuesday, January 17, 2012 at 11:08pm EST
This is true. Well, I must be off to study useless things aka global warming garbage, so I don't get another bad quiz grade in lees. I wish you the best of luck and I shall see you tomorrow. Goodnight!

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:31pm EST

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:31pm EST
every other day of your life

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:32pm EST
that is true

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:32pm EST
but it is especially noticeable today

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:33pm EST
why

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:33pm EST
they gave us uniforms

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:35pm EST
i suppose youre unhappy with those lol

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:36pm EST
not really they're nothing compared to summer guard

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:36pm EST
i'll just miss wearing normal clothes

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:36pm EST
anyway

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:36pm EST
what exciting things have you done today?

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:41pm EST
XD

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:41pm EST

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:41pm EST

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:41pm EST
what else is new. didn't do some questions cause i have no idea how to go about them. i know the answer for one but not how to get it

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:41pm EST
um

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:41pm EST
oh, then i came down here to start my drama

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:41pm EST
but my mom had me copy my senior pictures and it worked. ~cheating

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:41pm EST
and uh here i am

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:42pm EST
just did that like 2 mins ago

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:42pm EST
today was not a good day

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:42pm EST
because of those things? or something else

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:42pm EST
what you just listed didn't sound bad

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:42pm EST
well my pre calc mid term this morning

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:42pm EST
6 questions, i didn't answer one of them

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:42pm EST
they're 8 point questions

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:42pm EST
ohh

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:43pm EST
yeah

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:43pm EST
not fun

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:43pm EST
and the first one i did wrong but had no time to fix it

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:43pm EST
and then

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:43pm EST
my world affairs quiz

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:43pm EST
left 5 blank

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:43pm EST
dunno if i got any others wrong

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:43pm EST
highest i can get is a 75

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:43pm EST
not good bc i failed the last quiz (like everyone else). i'll just have to do good on the quiz monday & test wednesday

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:43pm EST
i still gotta finish labs. and i gotta start art stuff. i have ideas in my head for general pieces

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:44pm EST
but not concentration pieces which is a problem

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:45pm EST
I hate scoring my papers before the teacher does

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:45pm EST
and just by blank answer i know the best possible if i get everything answered correct

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:45pm EST
is like a C

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:45pm EST
exactly

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:45pm EST
it's awful

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
idk. i feel like even if i do bad onthat math thing though

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
which in reality is stupid bc it was open notebook

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
but you know, time. i can't manage it.

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
that's a tad worse

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
and you aren't the best with that

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
not that I can advise you

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
lol

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
I might be worse

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
but

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:46pm EST
see the only thing is i got a 66 on my last pre calc test

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:47pm EST
but i have a 99, 96, 82, and i think maybe one other grade

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:47pm EST
maybe

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:47pm EST
and 100 for the homework

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:47pm EST
i participate a lot

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:47pm EST
and i have extra credit from math league

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:47pm EST
even if i do kinda bad on this, i'll probably be able to just manage an A

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:47pm EST
you'll definitely get a B most likely get an A

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:48pm EST
i'm hoping cause taking that final would suuuck

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:48pm EST
oh shit

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:48pm EST
it would

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:48pm EST
last marking period i did worse and ended up with an A

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:48pm EST
you're probly fine

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:48pm EST
it's not like mr pecks where my grade is almost solely based on my tests -.-

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:49pm EST
btw, i have to include dimensions for all my pieces when i submit my portfolio. that is one of the most annoying things ever. just saying.

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:49pm EST
normally a good thing

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:49pm EST
anyway

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:50pm EST
that's sounds tortuous

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:50pm EST
have fun with that

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
I wonder if my other colleges need portfolios?

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
how would i send them?

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
shit

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
they'd tell you how i'm sure

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
like RPI is having me do it through slideroom

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
upload everything online. if anything you could mail them it too

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
and drexel want highschoolportfolio

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:52pm EST
and email is always an option

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:52pm EST

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:52pm EST

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:52pm EST

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:54pm EST
and i'm going to check everythiung now

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:55pm EST
oh my god i had a dream when i was napping. like. it was some sort of holiday and you could hear like everyone around the world count down and say something like it was new years but it wasn't and it was day time. so then military aircraft started flying around towns and rode along house roofs and whatnot. and all around houses things were dropped. but the things that were dropped there were three different things. it was rings from sonic, but i don't remember the other two. one was some sort of electronic device. and the other thing i think was purple. but it was awesome. and it was really weird when i woke up cause it felt real even though it obviously wasn't and the house and neighborhood i was in in the dream wasn't my own

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:56pm EST
you do that

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:56pm EST
sorry i just saw http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly0nkrV4UV1qjkwxto1_500.png and thought of that

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:56pm EST
those kind of dreams are fun

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:56pm EST
where its just shit happening

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:56pm EST

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:56pm EST
but i rarely get those

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:57pm EST
i haven't been remembering my dreams much lately. i remembered one a few days ago

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:57pm EST

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:57pm EST

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:58pm EST

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:58pm EST

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 9:58pm EST

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:13pm EST
too much so

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:13pm EST
i like how the files *have* to be jpeg

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:14pm EST
i save everything as .png cause it always looked better that way.. i saw no requirement like that for my portfolio so i don't care

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:14pm EST
glad i downloaded a file converter then

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:14pm EST
otherwise I'd be annoyed

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:15pm EST
At least 5 Images drawn from observation

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:15pm EST

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:15pm EST

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:16pm EST

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:17pm EST
to apply for architecture

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:17pm EST
that's odd

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:17pm EST
the portfolio itself

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
doesn't even relate to architecture

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
drexel said that too

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
just wants creative garbage

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
they don't want grpahi deisgn stuff

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
too bad 99% of my things are done in colored pencil

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
actually

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
i think everything i uploaded

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
oh wait no

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
not everything

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:19pm EST
i might add in that lichtenstein painting i did last year

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:19pm EST
who'd you do?

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
uhh anthony green from circa survive? i don't even listen to them but at the time it was one of the best pictures i could find

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
i wish i did someone else

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
it was in the back of one of my AP magazine

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
s

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:20pm EST
that's exciting

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:21pm EST
I'm really glad i did john green

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:21pm EST
just wish the text was more exciting

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:21pm EST
the way it looks i mean

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:21pm EST
yeah but it works how it is

Steph DudakWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:21pm EST
it looks really good

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:23pm EST

Nick DevlinWednesday, January 18, 2012 at 10:37pm EST
on repeat

Steph DudakFriday, January 20, 2012 at 2:25pm EST
do you think i can include stuff i did in computer graphics in my portfolio? Maybe not the floor plans but the screw driver and deck gun anyway?

Nick DevlinFriday, January 20, 2012 at 2:55pm EST
I did

Nick DevlinFriday, January 20, 2012 at 2:56pm EST
i don't see why you woulnt be able to

Steph DudakFriday, January 20, 2012 at 2:57pm EST
i feel like it'd be a good idea. http://i39.tinypic.com/2q0qemf.png ^ nearly perfect picture, no editing. unfortunately i wasn't so lucky with the heart but that's okay lol. yeah i don't see why either. i'm gonna. i wish i actually printed out small versions of those though

Steph DudakFriday, January 20, 2012 at 2:59pm EST
actually i do have one of the deck gun

Steph DudakFriday, January 20, 2012 at 2:59pm EST
sdjghfl and i have all of those um. shape things!

Steph DudakFriday, January 20, 2012 at 3:00pm EST
and the nuts and bolts and my original title blocks haha win

Steph DudakFriday, January 20, 2012 at 3:07pm EST
theyre all kinda useless though unless i can scan them which i can't so

Nick DevlinFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:05pm EST
You can scan them piece by piece?

Nick DevlinFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:05pm EST
meh idk

Nick DevlinFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:05pm EST
I like the brain pic

Nick DevlinFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:05pm EST
came out really clear

Steph DudakFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:05pm EST
i already submitted it

Steph DudakFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:06pm EST
i took pictures and you can see the dimensions and stuff

Nick DevlinFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:06pm EST
ah that might prevent that

Steph DudakFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:06pm EST
i put em in the middle though since they weren't the best things

Steph DudakFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:06pm EST
i just wanted to include them to show other stuff

Steph DudakFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:06pm EST
i put in the deck gun, screw driver, and truncated pyramid

Nick DevlinFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:07pm EST
we're about to start those

Nick DevlinFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:07pm EST
so excited

Steph DudakFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:07pm EST
:D

Steph DudakFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:07pm EST
i'm excited for you

Steph DudakFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:07pm EST
those were some of the most fun yet extremely frustrating projects ever

Steph DudakFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:07pm EST
wait til you have to cut out the tabs for the truncated cylinder o m g

Nick DevlinFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:08pm EST
0.0

Nick DevlinFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:08pm EST
I remember looking at yours

Steph DudakFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:08pm EST
OH the truncated cone that one

Steph DudakFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:08pm EST
not even the cylinder

Steph DudakFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:09pm EST
the truncated cylinder is bad. but the circles are bigger on the truncated cone

Steph DudakFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:09pm EST
and the bottom and top aren't attached to the middle in anyway

Steph DudakFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:09pm EST
which makes putting it together annoying

Nick DevlinFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:10pm EST
fun -.-

Steph DudakFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:10pm EST
the little figures are worth it in the end lol

Steph DudakFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:10pm EST
i dont have them anymore

Steph DudakFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:11pm EST
it'd be awesome if i did though

Steph DudakFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:11pm EST
could've included those with the layout in my portfolio

Nick DevlinFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:11pm EST
I wonder what kind of box I will bring in first?

Nick DevlinFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:11pm EST
It'll be complicated as hell

Nick DevlinFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:11pm EST
just cause I can

Nick DevlinFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:11pm EST
and I am allowed like 4 weeks per project

Nick DevlinFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:11pm EST
since my class is stupid

Nick DevlinFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:11pm EST
but that is a thought for some other day

Nick DevlinFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:12pm EST
since I have a competition tomrrow

Nick DevlinFriday, January 20, 2012 at 11:12pm EST

"There should be a minimum of (5) fi ve samples of drawings made from direct observation"

Nick DevlinSunday, January 22, 2012 at 4:54pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, January 22, 2012 at 4:55pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, January 22, 2012 at 4:55pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, January 22, 2012 at 4:56pm EST
when you sent me that portfolio requirements page i pointed that out

Nick DevlinSunday, January 22, 2012 at 4:56pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
I'm doing physics hw and getting questions right and it's amazing

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:18pm EST

L and R bother me

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:29pm EST
the rest i can accept

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:29pm EST
Yeah those are annoying J bothers me a little bit but it's not unbearable

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:30pm EST
Idk why it does

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:30pm EST
Just when it comes off the bottom yk

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:30pm EST
it's mostly because of how squarish it looks compared to the rest

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:31pm EST
I think I'm changing it

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:31pm EST
then i will copy paste some teeth on the circles

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:31pm EST

I finished my tire so I have the rest of the week to do what i want

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:32pm EST
Sounds like a plan Haha I still have to put in like the entire electrical circuit in my floor plan. I've done like nothing since it was assigned

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:33pm EST
you guys plan out wiring?

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:33pm EST
that sounds interesting

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:33pm EST
Which was... Tuesday? I have the master bedroom lights in. GFI outlets in the two bathrooms and a heat/light/fan switch thing in both

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:33pm EST
That's all I have done

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:33pm EST
I gotta put the circuit breaker in the garage. The smoke detectors. And the rest of the lights and outlets

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:34pm EST
Master bedroom still needs outlets

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:34pm EST
what about the heated floor and the air tube system that goes throughout the house and to various external ports?

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:34pm EST
plus all the dark matter storage container areas

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:34pm EST
you'll need a lot of outlets in there

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:34pm EST
Shut up its just lights and outlets for normal things

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:35pm EST
those aren't normal?

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:35pm EST
my mom said everyone had that stuff!!

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:35pm EST
-.-

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:38pm EST
So I'm gonna die when I have to take this pre calc test Wednesday

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
this is an odd flip flop

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
understanding physics and fear of pre calc test

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
I know o.o and the worst part about it is

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:40pm EST
My physics test goes on third marking period. The pre calc test I think goes on the second. I'll have to ask her

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:40pm EST
That'd suck

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:40pm EST
But it probably does

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:41pm EST
Omg third marking period. The years like halfway over now

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:41pm EST
more like 2/3

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:41pm EST
we don't do shit 4th quarter i don't think

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:42pm EST
well not in my classes anyway

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:42pm EST
Not really. I mean once like may hits no ones gonna give a shit cause they were already accepted into colleges and whatnot

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:43pm EST
I'll be done with actual lit in may, having taken my exam. After some day in may I have my ap art stuff to bring in for that "exam" and I get to work on my square

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:43pm EST
any ideas?

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
I haven't really thought about it yet. That's another thing I gotta think about but I'll probably wait to brainstorm about that on a later date

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
Bc idk what my concentration is yet /:

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
good ide

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
She really is no help

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
meh

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
"you can do better"

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
at least you're not teaching her how to draw

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
"these four show some kind of progression and a direction" Yet Those four had the same base ideas as the other ones

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
True

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
But still

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
yeah I got what you mean

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
I think she just like the more abstract designs the best

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
She does

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
She told me. She likes all the pieces I have individually. But she likes the ones that are actually designed based best just bc that's the art style she likes

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:47pm EST
Meanwhile while we were critiquing my stuff Jess liked all the more realistic looking things bc that's her art style Irrelevant

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:47pm EST
I just can't seem to lock in on an idea

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:48pm EST
because locking in

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:48pm EST
isn't really a concept associated with art

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
Not necessarily. A concentration is actually a common thing

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
Like

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
a 30 day challenge

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
Have you ever really scrolled through deviantart? I'm watching this one girl who takes these awesome self portraits with fruits

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
yeah

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
I've seen people do those

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
I suppose comics are concentrated art

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
and disney

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
and most things

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
but still

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
Not Necessarily either lol

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
its hard

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
idk I am not good at describing things well when distracted

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:51pm EST
It's just following a certain theme and exploring it. Like Ben Heine I think it's spelled. He does mixed media photography where he has a piece of paper with a drawing in place of an object I'm sure you've seen some of it It's fantastic

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:52pm EST
that's cool

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:52pm EST
Idk. The point is I'm creative til the point where I need to follow a certain thing

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:52pm EST
Even where I was going with these like it seemed to make sense but idk. I CAN DO BETTER apparently. Whatever that means.

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:53pm EST
it's almost like you can't make the pieces you are trying to make because you are all rushed

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:54pm EST
I have random ideas for things. Some of which haven't been working out. But nothing follows a certain thing. My heads too over the place for that

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:56pm EST
i can sympathize

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 10:56pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:20pm EST
Speaking of crack addicts

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:21pm EST
And you being a slacker

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:21pm EST
- Mental disorders personified through the physical appearance of a person or in their environment. someone who is bipolar might be wearing a mask. A schizo may see mouths on furniture as if that may be the source of the voices they hear -the affects of drugs personified through the environment and physical appearance of a person Interesting ideas. Not that imma use em I'm just saying

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:22pm EST
they are

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:22pm EST
i wonder how paranoia would be personified

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:22pm EST
or autism

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:23pm EST
dyslexia

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:23pm EST
that one might be fun

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:23pm EST
use tyopgraphy

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:23pm EST
That would be cool

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:24pm EST
and you could use design and abstract-ness

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:24pm EST
since the letters and words would be all fucked up

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:24pm EST
give it weird colours

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:24pm EST
If I had time I'd try to do something along those lines Technically I could and use all my other stuff as breadth pieces rofl. Noooo. You know what I like

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
yeah that idea totally works

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
do it

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:25pm EST
i won't stop you

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:26pm EST
Psychedelic art is cool

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:26pm EST
like the stuff on applegates cabinets

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:26pm EST
http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_art I have a lot in my art tag too

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:28pm EST
Why do I like things that are associated with not so good things

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:28pm EST
Like

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:28pm EST
Graffiti is illegal

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:28pm EST
Psychedelic art often involves drugs

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:29pm EST
Other morbid things I mean. I don't think ripping organs out or kind of wanting to draw from real organs is really a totally good/normal thing I think it's something in my brain

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:30pm EST
Cause I'm a really good kid. It's like an alter ego except not at all

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:31pm EST
i want to let you keep rambling to see where you go

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:31pm EST
but i get it

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:32pm EST
If I wasn't simultaneously doing math homework

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:32pm EST
That probably would've turned into an idea

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:33pm EST
alter ego

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:33pm EST
kinda like split personaly i suppose

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:33pm EST
or bipolar

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:33pm EST
or schizophrenic

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:33pm EST
Schizophrenic

Steph DudakMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:34pm EST
Yeah

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:39pm EST

Nick DevlinMonday, January 23, 2012 at 11:40pm EST

Steph DudakTuesday, January 24, 2012 at 12:09am EST
Good

Steph DudakTuesday, January 24, 2012 at 12:13am EST
What if I make my concentration be something like "what lies beneath" or something like that. So it's not necessarily emotion or anything. Just different ways to show people's inner beings or something like that being brought into the light Out to the surface

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 24, 2012 at 12:15am EST
sounds good to me

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 24, 2012 at 12:15am EST

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 24, 2012 at 12:15am EST
you just think of that

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 24, 2012 at 12:15am EST

Steph DudakTuesday, January 24, 2012 at 12:15am EST
Trying to think of something that can fit with those few pieces I have now as well so that I can still use them but it'll make sense. Yes I did

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 24, 2012 at 12:21am EST

Steph DudakThursday, January 26, 2012 at 7:10pm EST
which one of the comedies

Steph DudakThursday, January 26, 2012 at 7:10pm EST
seems most interesting

Steph DudakThursday, January 26, 2012 at 7:10pm EST
i need to pick like a um two like passage things that characterize two characters. she's like preferably one after the other or something weird like that blahblahblah

Steph DudakThursday, January 26, 2012 at 7:11pm EST
i tried to read the tempest or whatever that didn't seem to work out very welll

Nick DevlinThursday, January 26, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
As you like it

Nick DevlinThursday, January 26, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
people say that's one of his best

Nick DevlinThursday, January 26, 2012 at 7:12pm EST
and has his most well developed female charcter out of any of his plays

Steph DudakThursday, January 26, 2012 at 7:24pm EST
PROTEUS He after honour hunts, I after love: He leaves his friends to dignify them more, I leave myself, my friends and all, for love. Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me, Made me neglect my studies, lose my time, War with good counsel, set the world at nought; Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.

Steph DudakThursday, January 26, 2012 at 7:25pm EST
this isn't in the one you were talking about

Nick DevlinThursday, January 26, 2012 at 7:26pm EST
no it is not

Steph DudakThursday, January 26, 2012 at 7:27pm EST
direct characterization~

Nick DevlinThursday, January 26, 2012 at 7:27pm EST
very direct

Steph DudakThursday, January 26, 2012 at 7:28pm EST
the other guy valentine leaves right before that though

Steph DudakThursday, January 26, 2012 at 7:28pm EST
i don't think they really need to be in like. i cant think of the word but right after each other but i feel like she'd rather it like that

Nick DevlinThursday, January 26, 2012 at 7:29pm EST
"i don't think they really need to be in like. i cant think of the word but right after each other but i feel like she'd rather it like that"

Nick DevlinThursday, January 26, 2012 at 7:29pm EST
Was I meant to understand that sentence you just wrote?

Steph DudakThursday, January 26, 2012 at 7:33pm EST
uhhhhh

Steph DudakThursday, January 26, 2012 at 7:33pm EST
no normal person would've understood that i don't think

Nick DevlinThursday, January 26, 2012 at 7:34pm EST
so obviously you expect me to

Steph DudakThursday, January 26, 2012 at 7:34pm EST
theee passages. of two characters. being characterized. i don't think they have to be one right after each other. for example: Person 1: hey i'm characterizing myself and stuff Person 2: hey i'm also characterizing myself and i'm characterizing person 1. i don't like him. as opposed to two randomly picked passages. but i feel like she'd want them to be one right after the other

Nick DevlinThursday, January 26, 2012 at 7:35pm EST
ah

Nick DevlinThursday, January 26, 2012 at 7:35pm EST
you want the characterizations to be realted

Nick DevlinThursday, January 26, 2012 at 7:35pm EST
and preferably foiling weachother

Steph DudakThursday, January 26, 2012 at 7:36pm EST
i suppose

Steph DudakThursday, January 26, 2012 at 7:36pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, January 26, 2012 at 8:02pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, January 26, 2012 at 8:02pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, January 26, 2012 at 8:02pm EST
too bad you need 4 years

Nick DevlinThursday, January 26, 2012 at 8:03pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, January 26, 2012 at 8:04pm EST
and possibly learn how to write essaysd

Steph DudakThursday, January 26, 2012 at 8:04pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, January 26, 2012 at 8:04pm EST
along with i had no actual books for that class lol

Nick DevlinThursday, January 26, 2012 at 8:04pm EST
reasons why i should have taken it

Steph DudakThursday, January 26, 2012 at 8:04pm EST
and he's so laid back and stuff it was one of the easiest classes of my day

Steph DudakThursday, January 26, 2012 at 8:04pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, January 26, 2012 at 8:04pm EST
to be completely honest

Nick DevlinThursday, January 26, 2012 at 8:05pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, January 26, 2012 at 8:05pm EST

Well a woman who'll kiss on the very first date Is usually a hussy. And a woman who'll kiss on the second time out Is anything but fussy. But a woman who waits 'til the third time around, Head in the clouds, feet on the ground! She's the girl he's glad he's found--she's his Shi-Poo-Pi! Shi-Poo-Pi! Shi-Poo-Pi! Shi-Poo-Pi!

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 2:56pm EST
“To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.” -- Ralph Waldo Emerson. Growing up, we are heavily influenced by the people around us. One main idea we are given is that we cannot live happy, successful lives unless we get a job that will make us a lot of money. While money is an important factor in life, it is also important that you spend your life doing something you actually enjoy doing. It is important to follow your own path and see where it takes you. You only have one life to live; do what makes you happy. This is something I have considered in deciding my major in college. I have always taken an interest in art and math which, in addition to my already developed interest in computer graphics, influenced me to take Introduction to Computer Graphics when I began high school. As a result of my enjoyment in this class, I took Advanced Computer Graphics junior year, along with regular art classes my sophomore, junior, and senior year, and am currently enrolled in an Architectural Design class. At the end of my Advanced Computer Graphics class, we started drawing floor plans in DataCad. It was at this point that I realized I wanted to major in architecture because of how much fun I had creating the floor plans and elevation views. This year I am expanding on that knowledge and began this year drawing floor plans by hand. While it takes a while to do, the final product is worth it. I have also moved on from drawing by hand to using CadKey to draw floor plans and I have learned how to add electrical circuits into the plans. Throughout high school, I have reconsidered multiple times my major choice for college but I am now sure of what I want to do. What I have also realized is I might have always known this. Ever since I was young, I have loved looking at houses and buildings while thinking of ideas for a future home that I would design myself. Living in a house that I designed has always been a dream of mine and I plan to do what it takes to make this dream come true. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, the greatest accomplishment one can achieve in this world is to be themselves. I hope to do this by pursuing an architecture major and becoming the person I see myself being. You've already read this like 786 times, but could this count as a "topic of my choice"

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 2:56pm EST
practice is good

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 2:57pm EST
something you actually enjoy doing.-->you love doing? idk sounds nicer

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 2:57pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 2:57pm EST

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 2:58pm EST

If you have not already done so, you must complete the 2012-2013 CSS (College Scholarship Service) PROFILE application for us to fully evaluate your eligibility for our Rensselaer grants and campus-based aid programs. In addition, all federal aid programs require the completion of the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid). Both the PROFILE application and FAFSA can be done immediately. Our priority filing deadline for these applications in order to ensure that you receive your financial aid, should you be accepted at Rensselaer, is 2/1/2012. Here are the websites for you to visit for more information: CSS PROFILE: https://profileonline.collegeboard.com. (Our school code is 2757) FAFSA: www.fafsa.gov (Our school code is 002803) There is no charge to file the FAFSA. Depending on family income and assets, CSS Profile may allow you file the application without paying a fee.

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 9:54pm EST
Divided into three vertical rectangles so the white space on the aides and stuff would be like a black border

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 9:56pm EST
I was thinking of having the first square, right of the face, some smiley thing. Only shows the eye and part of the mouth But on of those really fake smiles Then the middle I wanted to be like the skin peeling or something idk ripping melting suggestion to make it not lame And then the third which is the left side of the face To show the inside of the person How they really are Bringing that up front But idk what to do

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 9:56pm EST
I didn't really think about it

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 9:57pm EST
I still wanna do the thing I tried to do a million years. Ago with the eyes melting out of the persons sockets

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 9:57pm EST
those sound interesting

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 9:59pm EST
Idk what the skin peely one should reveal. I first had in mind some angry thing

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:00pm EST
scary design

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:00pm EST
jagged lines

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:00pm EST
blacks and reds

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:01pm EST
Yeah. See the thing is if I did a design for that I'd have to do some sort of design for the first one too don't youu think?

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:01pm EST
a more peaceful one

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:01pm EST
to contrast

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:04pm EST
I need more patterns and things to add to my arsenal I feel like I draw a lot of the same things

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:05pm EST
Oh what's something I can put in the pupil of an eye

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:06pm EST
as in?

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:06pm EST
an object?

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:06pm EST
Anything

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:06pm EST
have it be a shoe behind a glass pane

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
because eyes are the window to your sole--soul

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
Ok not that ridiculous

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
It's a tiny circle

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
i'm very proud of that one

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
Maybe half an inch diameter

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
but alright

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
That was good tho lol

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
umm

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:07pm EST
that's tiny

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:08pm EST
More than half actually

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:08pm EST
Like 3/4

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:08pm EST
still tiny

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:08pm EST
Just estimating something simple

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:08pm EST
but a bit more acceptable

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:08pm EST
a lightbulb?

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:08pm EST
uh

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:08pm EST
some animal head

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:08pm EST
That reminds me

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
hm?

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
I wanted to do a piece with light bulbs

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
Falling out of someone's head

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
interested

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
Losing ideas Basically me in a nutshell

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
how many *insert stereotype here* does it take to screw in a lightbulb

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
first thing i thought of

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:09pm EST
Why does it take more than one squirrel to screw in a lightbulb

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
Because

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
They're so darn stupid

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
spongebob?

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
Yessir

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
i member

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:10pm EST
But um yeah then the background will be all swirly and stuff can come out of the lightbulbs that fell to the ground

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
DAMN IT MORE BROKEN GLASS

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
sorry

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:11pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
Idk if that could fit into my concentration but iit looks cool in my head

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
falling out of the head

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
Lol old time ideas

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
that way they're easier to draw

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:11pm EST
Before lightbulbs ideas were represented by candles

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:13pm EST
exactly

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:13pm EST
Interesting

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:17pm EST
i thought so

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:17pm EST
gives you new textures as well

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:17pm EST
and fire

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:17pm EST
i like fire

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
If the candles set things on fire

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:18pm EST
Like papers and shit and the smoke released pretty little things

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:19pm EST
How the fuck am I gonna do this Theres another one that can be looking inside someone Someones brain overflowing with ideas With no way to get out. All chained up and stuff

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:19pm EST
your welcome

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:19pm EST
Their whole inside their rad really

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:19pm EST
Head*

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:19pm EST
Rad wtf

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:19pm EST

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:24pm EST
HAHA

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:24pm EST
TOTALLY

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:24pm EST
If you sculpt something like that. Well like make the base of the lightbulb a candle holder And then the bulb part twists on

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:24pm EST
That'd be fun

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:24pm EST
What o.o

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:25pm EST
downloaded gridworld(I was supposed to get that over the summer with java) played with it for 5 minutes, and finished all the work I needed to do with it!

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:25pm EST
easiest program ever

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:25pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:26pm EST
Hahaha awesome Because That's how life works Procrastinaaaaation -rainbow-

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:26pm EST
that should be my motto

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:34pm EST
It should be

Nick DevlinMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
goodnight

Steph DudakMonday, January 30, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
Goodnight

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:03pm EST

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:03pm EST

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:03pm EST
do something else then

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:03pm EST
it doesn't help that all the ones by my house are derpy looking

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:04pm EST
don't draw trees then

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:04pm EST
pfft an idea that makes sense?

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:04pm EST
no my plan

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:04pm EST
was to grow a new tree

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:05pm EST
so that it would look just right for me to draw

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:07pm EST
even better idea

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:07pm EST
i thought so

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:11pm EST
um draw an easier tree then a shorter one go to a park and draw swings or a slide or something

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:12pm EST
go to the beach draw the ocean

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:12pm EST

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:21pm EST

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:21pm EST

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:23pm EST

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:23pm EST

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:27pm EST
this debate is getting a bit serious

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:29pm EST
good

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:30pm EST
keep goin til you get the last word~

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:31pm EST
oh i am

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:31pm EST
here's his ananolgy

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:31pm EST
for example, if one was sick and only one medication could cure them of the specific disease, they would insist on using only that one medication if it was available, and nothing else. God always exists and thus His mercy is always available for those who choose to believe in Him properly and rely on Him, so it does not make sense to, when the One True God can be relied upon, to turn to a creation and falsely label it

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:32pm EST
when would there ever be only one medication?

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:32pm EST
differnt doctors prescribe different things

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:32pm EST
let alone people who aren't doctors

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:32pm EST
which i will point out

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:32pm EST
except more eloquently

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:34pm EST
oh gosh

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:46pm EST
ugh this is going on forever

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:46pm EST
that's what happen when you debate religion lol

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:47pm EST
When someone uses their sound mind, they reach the conclusions that God must exist, and that He does not resemble the creations in any way. These are facts, not matters of opinion.

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:47pm EST
I hate when people use the word fact

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:47pm EST

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:47pm EST
religion =/= fact there is no proof

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:48pm EST
my points

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:48pm EST
which he will no doubt refute eventually

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:57pm EST
I respond again at #28

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 3:58pm EST
Onee second

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:05pm EST
That guy

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:05pm EST
Pisses me off

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:05pm EST
For a lot of reasons

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:05pm EST
The sound mind, which we humans have to allow us to understand basic truths, does not accept the non-existence of God or a doubt in God's existence. Seriously?

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:06pm EST
yeah i ignored those comments

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:06pm EST
or else iwouldn't have even responded

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:08pm EST
Three types of beliefs of god that are false

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:08pm EST
1. Some believe that God does not exist. 2. Some believe God has a partner. 3. Some believe a "part of God" is in everything.

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:08pm EST
Idiotic

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:10pm EST
The thing that invalidates his entire argument is belief. That one word

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:11pm EST
Would invalidate* but idk if he said *he* believes

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:11pm EST
Yeah I never argue that point

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:12pm EST
because they always just redefine the meaning of the word believe

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:12pm EST
Carefully picks his words I'll give him that Yeah but that's not really a word you can redefine yk what I mean

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:12pm EST
i do

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:13pm EST
I'm still reading this though, just commenting in between lol

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:13pm EST
its pretty long

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:14pm EST
When someone uses their sound mind, they reach the conclusions that God must exist, and that He does not resemble the creations in any way. These are facts, not matters of opinion. Their sound mind Implying you aren't sound of mind if you reject that some sort of God exists

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:15pm EST
yep

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:15pm EST
that annoyed me too

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:16pm EST
I tried to sound as non confronting as possible so he wouldn't get pissed and stop replying

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:17pm EST
I enjoy hear other opinions, unlike hm

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:18pm EST
There are some pretty sound of mind atheists that are extremely intelligent just sayin Thats true. Idk if I'd be able to do that How awesome would it be if someone in my class was like that kid That'd be so much fun for debates

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:18pm EST
i feel like playing devil's advocate sometimes

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:19pm EST
but i hear how people talk about eachother after debates

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:19pm EST
don

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:23pm EST
't feel like being that guy

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:24pm EST
Well I like making people look dumb for saying certain things. It's ultimately their fault for what they make themselves come off as. I'm still trying to figure out a way to debate religion in there in a way which we haven't already done so in many of our previous debates. Btw I finished reading

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:25pm EST
awesome

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:25pm EST
and religion has been debated for a couple thousand years

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:25pm EST
not too many new ways to do it

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:26pm EST
What I mean is like as far as questions goes I feel like we all have a general idea of what most people in our class believes in bc of the other debates

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:27pm EST
And I mean literally we haven't done, as in our class

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:29pm EST
i'd respond, but i am not entirely sure what you are saying

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:29pm EST
i think you left out some words

Steph DudakTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:30pm EST
Meh nevermind lol unimportant. It was more of an out loud thought. But I was referring to *what* about religion. I can't be like sup. religion. Debate it.

Nick DevlinTuesday, January 31, 2012 at 4:30pm EST
ah
