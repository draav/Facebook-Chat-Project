Steph DudakFriday, May 3, 2013 at 4:56pm EDT
nope just somewhere within walking/biking distance to my house. julie told me to call the people at her work but i'm not trying to work in lavalette because i don't have a car and would have to depend on people and that's not what i'm trying to do

Steph DudakFriday, May 3, 2013 at 4:57pm EDT
i'll probably end up applying to michaels

Steph DudakFriday, May 3, 2013 at 4:58pm EDT
i told my mother to let me know of places since she's obviously home and i'm not

Nick DevlinFriday, May 3, 2013 at 4:58pm EDT
Good idea, it's not fun depending on people for work. and michaels doesnt sound to bad.

Nick DevlinFriday, May 3, 2013 at 4:58pm EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, May 3, 2013 at 4:58pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:28pm EDT
so the best question anyone can ever ask me is "what is your greatest accomplishment" cause it's at that moment that i forget everything i've ever achieved

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:28pm EDT
i think it's the "best" part

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:28pm EDT
that screw you over

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:29pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:29pm EDT
for future reference though

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:29pm EDT
when people ask you youre answer should be "I met Nick Devlin"

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:30pm EDT
that should make life easier

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:32pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:35pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:35pm EDT
i got perfect attendance for all four years of highschool, i've gotten plenty of academic awards. i mean. i went to college and successfully completed a year of architecture school. that's a pretty legit accomplishment But i dunno they seem boring lol

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:36pm EDT
hmmm, pick something that like

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:36pm EDT
shows good traits

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:37pm EDT
like finishing a year of school

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:37pm EDT
In order to do that

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:37pm EDT
you need organization and dedication and attendance

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:37pm EDT
and it shows that you value that stuff

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:37pm EDT
otherwise you wouldnt be proud of it

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:38pm EDT
you could do the same for any project youve done in architecture or design. And award or scholarship you ever got

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:38pm EDT
and just list the good qualities you needed to accomplish that goal

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:38pm EDT
so that they think youre awesome!

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:45pm EDT
or something random i dunno how important that question is

Steph DudakThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:46pm EDT
right sorry yeah that's a good answer though lol i linked my perf attendance with architecture school and how i value time and attendance and all this junk because of it. whateva thanks yo

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:46pm EDT
sounds good to me

Steph DudakThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:46pm EDT
"least favorite thing to do each day" does not exist

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:47pm EDT
"writing resumes"

Steph DudakThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:48pm EDT
lets not lol

Steph DudakThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:48pm EDT
but i honestly don't have a favorite thing that i do each day because i don't mind doing the things i do. especially considering I know they have to be done and I know the reason for why they need to be. stupid.

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:49pm EDT
yeah i don't really have an answer to that either

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:49pm EDT
hmm

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:49pm EDT
waking up early?

Steph DudakThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:49pm EDT
nope because i want morning times lol

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:49pm EDT
yeah that might not work

Steph DudakThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:50pm EDT
applies for hours in the morning appears to hate waking up early declined

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:50pm EDT
they'd appreciate your honesty i'm sure though

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:50pm EDT
i hate when I have to leave work I just love it so much that I never wanna stop

Steph DudakThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:51pm EDT
hahaha

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:51pm EDT
theyd appreciate your ability to suck up

Steph DudakThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:55pm EDT
favorite thing is how i have 0 work experience

Steph DudakThursday, May 9, 2013 at 2:57pm EDT
and these things are too specific for volunteer work bye

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:00pm EDT
thats really annoying

Steph DudakThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:00pm EDT
i'm gonna try to throw it in there anyway cause i did a bunch of stupid volunteer work, mainly the library stuff

Steph DudakThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:00pm EDT
but i don't quite remember the months i did SAIL

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:01pm EDT
like what days they were? Or what you did

Steph DudakThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:01pm EDT
month/year i remember the things i did

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:01pm EDT
well it was probably summer 2012

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:01pm EDT
nope

Steph DudakThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:01pm EDT
well yes i did it twice

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:01pm EDT
2011*

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:02pm EDT
because I was in it the year after junior

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:02pm EDT
and you went to the party

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:02pm EDT
and kevin was there

Steph DudakThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:02pm EDT
yeah and that was the last one i was allowed to do

Steph DudakThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:02pm EDT
if i recall correctly

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:02pm EDT
yep

Steph DudakThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:02pm EDT
so i did summer 2010/2011

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:02pm EDT
no high school graduates allowed :'(

Steph DudakThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:02pm EDT
but i dont remember what month

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:02pm EDT
hmmm probably july or august, do you have your little certificates?

Steph DudakThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:03pm EDT
maybe somewhere

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:03pm EDT
Just say July

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:03pm EDT
i doubt it matters much

Steph DudakThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:04pm EDT
especially since it's a started ended field to fill in. the thing says "ARE YOU SUREYOU WANNA SKIP THIS?? EVEN ENTERING VOLUNTEER WORK IS A GOD IDEA YOU KNOW" they should have a separate section for htat.

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:05pm EDT
i suppose, if they are just looking to see if you can have an assignment and complete it

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:05pm EDT
outside of school

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:05pm EDT
it dont matter if its paid or not

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:05pm EDT
whatever makes them happy

Steph DudakThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:06pm EDT
sail was what, two weeks?

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:06pm EDT
yes

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:06pm EDT
there was also TAB and reading buddies if you ever did any of those

Steph DudakThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:07pm EDT
i didn't really do reading buddies but i had to do that once during sail i suppose reading with a child i wasn't a real reading buddy though haha

Steph DudakThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:07pm EDT
i'd include TAB if i went to more than 2 meetings

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:07pm EDT
that makes sense

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:12pm EDT
hmm school clubs?

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:12pm EDT
the volunteer stuff for

Nick DevlinThursday, May 9, 2013 at 3:12pm EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 12:55pm EDT
I am very unbiased :)

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 12:55pm EDT
is Sean the one that did nothing?

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 12:55pm EDT
because he thinks he should have a higher grade i kind of agree with the grade that betty gave him, his work wasn't thrilling this semester

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 12:55pm EDT
he did things

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 12:55pm EDT
i can send you his portfolio later

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 12:55pm EDT
but

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 12:57pm EDT
yeah

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 12:57pm EDT
i understand

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 12:57pm EDT
i think

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 12:57pm EDT
maybe

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 12:57pm EDT
betty often does this thing too where she'll give a certain grade to push you to do better you know. like mid semester.

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 12:57pm EDT
and he's all

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 12:57pm EDT
wah wahwha "ugh i hate it when she does this shit you want to push me? give me an A- and expect me to hold that grade because I am very good at doing that she knows that too ughhhh and it pisses me off that she didnt like my portfolio when Haley and Peter got a better grade on it than me. They had no graphic design element to threirs at all. It was all white space and photographs"

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 12:57pm EDT
but he didn't deserve an A-

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 12:59pm EDT
thats silly

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 12:59pm EDT
and congrats on your gps!

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 12:59pm EDT
:)

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:00pm EDT
i see you making fun of my spelling error haha thank you !

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:00pm EDT
this btw

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:00pm EDT
nooooo

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:01pm EDT
did he paint it?

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:02pm EDT
no it's a conceptual drawing we had to do for a project as his background for the things

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:02pm EDT
you'll see the full one later in the portfolio

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:03pm EDT
no I mean like the first page

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:03pm EDT
with the lines

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:03pm EDT
yes

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:03pm EDT
that's also from that drawing

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:03pm EDT
gotcha

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:03pm EDT
and is there a reason he used no punctuation?

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:03pm EDT
he did it in ink on mylar

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:03pm EDT
uh

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:03pm EDT
i dunno lol

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:04pm EDT
there's punctuation?

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:05pm EDT
No capitilization

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:05pm EDT
sorry

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:05pm EDT
also he was an idiot and did the whole thing in photoshop instead of indesign. that's not a big deal. personal taste kind of thing

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:06pm EDT
betty's also a fan of lowercase clean fonts and such

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:06pm EDT
whatevers makes him happy i guess

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:06pm EDT
hmm interesting

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:06pm EDT
i also didn't capitalize, out of habit whenever we need to label things and such

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:06pm EDT
it's lowercase

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:06pm EDT
interesting. I dunno I've just been editing papers a lot and it like made me cringe a little

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:07pm EDT
understandable lol

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:08pm EDT
But yeah I dunno it looked fine to me, Not AWESOME but still coolish

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:08pm EDT
the only thing I really noticed was the glass stairs

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:10pm EDT
it's just dumb he's annoyed because he doesn't have a better grade but he deserves the grade he got. he's comparing his portfolio to hayley and peter's because theirs are just simple, white with photos and such. but he fails to realize that they also probably did better on every project than him

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:11pm EDT
peter got an A- on the final project, they both got and A-on the house project

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:11pm EDT
never compare yourself to others always a bad idea

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:11pm EDT
hayley was one of the top three favorite conceptual drawings of betty's

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:11pm EDT
her mondo was great too

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:11pm EDT
he fails to look at all of this

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:11pm EDT
silly

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:11pm EDT
he got a B on nearly everything

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:11pm EDT
Who was the guy

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:11pm EDT
that had the buildings on the slope

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:11pm EDT
evan?

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:12pm EDT
Maybe?

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:12pm EDT
yes

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:12pm EDT
He was right behind you

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:12pm EDT
yes evan

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:12pm EDT
That one was really cool to me

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:12pm EDT
And he had all the little tiny things

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:12pm EDT
his was great

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:13pm EDT
i have no idea what he got on that project but it better have been in the A-/A range. everything he produced was beautiful and he did a great job presenting

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:13pm EDT
Thats good

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:14pm EDT
I was scared that his was actually like cliche and garbage and i had no taste

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:14pm EDT
no i really liked his project also

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:14pm EDT
Did you bring yours home?

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:14pm EDT
no i didn't

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:15pm EDT
it'll be gone forever, all i have is the photos

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:15pm EDT
there wasn't enough room in the car for that and the house model and i didn't want it that badly either.

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:15pm EDT
what happened to it!

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:15pm EDT
i left it on the table in the studi

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:15pm EDT
o

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:15pm EDT
I wouldve totally jacked it

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:15pm EDT
my parents thought it was a good idea to take my mothers car to pack my things

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:16pm EDT
everything just barely fit

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:16pm EDT
I hate when I see super awesome projects and art just left to get thrown out

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:16pm EDT
There's tons of stuff in the ceramics rooms here just hidden where no one will see

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:16pm EDT
and it makes me sad

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:16pm EDT
i didn't want to leave it but what am i going to do with something that's 32 stacked pieces of cardboard high and almost as big as the original model lol

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:16pm EDT
eventually i'll have to get rid of these things

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 1:17pm EDT
i can't keep every model i make for the next four years

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 2:01pm EDT
YES YOU CAN!!!

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 2:02pm EDT
You'll need them when you have your museum exhibit!

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 2:02pm EDT
I've got this all planned out!

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 2:02pm EDT
youre ruining it!

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 2:02pm EDT
I'll rent one of those garage storage places

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 2:02pm EDT
it'll be like that Cave of mysteries from aladdin

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 2:03pm EDT
but with lots of basswood and cardboard

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 2:16pm EDT
hahaha darn im sorry

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 2:18pm EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 2:18pm EDT

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 2:19pm EDT

Steph DudakFriday, May 10, 2013 at 2:19pm EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 2:19pm EDT
Thankfully I always use debit card

Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 2:21pm EDT
Nick DevlinFriday, May 10, 2013 at 2:21pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, May 11, 2013 at 10:48pm EDT
rich wants to know if y'alls job pays over or under the table

Nick DevlinSunday, May 12, 2013 at 12:29am EDT
what does that mean?

Steph DudakSunday, May 12, 2013 at 12:46am EDT
getting paid under the table means you keep everything you earn, no taxes and such

Nick DevlinSunday, May 12, 2013 at 12:47am EDT
there are taxes

Steph DudakSunday, May 12, 2013 at 10:54am EDT
I DID NOT LOSE MY SOCIAL SECURITY CARD I FOUND IT THANK THE HEAVENS

Nick DevlinThursday, May 23, 2013 at 12:41pm EDT
alarms might help

Nick DevlinThursday, May 23, 2013 at 12:41pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, May 23, 2013 at 12:42pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, May 23, 2013 at 12:46pm EDT
and killing yourself might not be the appropriate solution

Nick DevlinThursday, May 23, 2013 at 12:48pm EDT
is sims like one world you play in?

Nick DevlinThursday, May 23, 2013 at 12:48pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, May 30, 2013 at 11:30pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, May 30, 2013 at 11:30pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, May 30, 2013 at 11:36pm EDT
So how have you been spending your summer thus far?

Steph DudakThursday, May 30, 2013 at 11:36pm EDT
doing nothing/applying everywhere and still not getting a job

Steph DudakThursday, May 30, 2013 at 11:36pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, May 30, 2013 at 11:39pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, May 30, 2013 at 11:39pm EDT
basically what i did during school

Nick DevlinThursday, May 30, 2013 at 11:39pm EDT
-school

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:36am EDT
You arent still awake are you

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:36am EDT
i am

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:36am EDT
good good

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:36am EDT
i just want to complain about how much i hate questions on job apps

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:36am EDT
lets take

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:37am EDT
this one for instance

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:37am EDT
i cant wait

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:37am EDT
:D

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:37am EDT
You are doing an inventory of store merchandise and have been working for over 15 minutes on a complex counting task that requires your full concentration. A customer stops you and requests help in getting something down from a high shelf. Which of the following would you most likely do? Stop doing the task and go help the customer, knowing that you will have to re-start the task from the beginning when you come back. Ask the customer to wait just a minute and promise that you will help when you finish the task. Tell the customer that you are unable to help at the moment, but that another associate should come by in a few moments who can provide assistance. Ask a co-worker to do the task while you help the customer.

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:37am EDT
will i honestly have to restart it? come on. i'm not dumb. and if a customer interrupted me, well then surely by that logic i must restart now

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:38am EDT
so i might as well help them get the damn thing they cant reach

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:38am EDT
i'm pretty sure customer service always comes first

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:38am EDT
so yeah

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:39am EDT
You have been asked to create a display of seasonal merchandise by the end of your shift. However, you realize that you won't be able to finish the work in time at the rate you are going. Which of the following would you most likely do? Ask your supervisor if you can finish the work when you come back to work the next day. Start working faster. Ask a coworker for help. Stay after your shift ends and work overtime to get the job done. "Start working faster" lol

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:39am EDT
where is this for?

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:40am EDT
shoprite

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:40am EDT
-.-

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:40am EDT
don't give me that face

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:40am EDT
I mean the questions they are asking

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:40am EDT
oh yeah

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:40am EDT
i've done this application about 5 times already, cause my cousins tried applying here a billion times

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:40am EDT
and honestly my answer for that is going to be four bc that's what i do in school too lolol

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:40am EDT
but

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:40am EDT
they're stupid

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:41am EDT
yep sara's been trying too apply everywhere as well

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:41am EDT
and i've been seeing lots of ridiculous questions

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:41am EDT
like what do they expect you to do

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:41am EDT
You havent been trained at that store yet and different stores have different policies

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:58am EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:59am EDT
ohhh look at you go

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:59am EDT
what does integrity mean to you she asked this one question in a roundabout way, explaining for like 3 minutes, which was essentially: if you had to do something and report your progress to a person, how would you go about that?

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:59am EDT
they actually called back?

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 12:59am EDT
um.. keep track of my progress and tell them????

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:00am EDT

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:00am EDT

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:01am EDT
WHEN I HAVE 0 WORK EXPERIENCE AND KEEP HAVING TO FILL IN WHEN I VOLUNTEERED AT THE LIBRARY WHEN IT'S /KIND OF/ RELEVANT

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:01am EDT
ugh

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:02am EDT
would that be considered a catch 22?

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:02am EDT
yes it is

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:02am EDT
in order to get a job you need a job

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:02am EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:04am EDT
its obvioulsy your fault for not having a richer family or a random millionaire to get you a job

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:05am EDT
i read another thing on the internet today about architecture and how it's just a world of debt

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:05am EDT
i also found out there are plenty of firms in new jersey, some of which were on fancy lists all about an hour away at the least from here

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:05am EDT
thats pretty good, does your school offer any coop opportunities? or ways to get connections?

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:07am EDT
we don't offer a coop thing but you meet people just by going to classes like a lot of the teachers obviously are also practicing architects and people that work at firms and theres lectures for days with fancy people

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:07am EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:08am EDT

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:08am EDT
which is another fun thing

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:08am EDT
architecture jobs

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:08am EDT

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:09am EDT

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:16am EDT

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:16am EDT

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:17am EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:18am EDT
i try not to talk at all about work with sara because I cant do shit

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:18am EDT

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:21am EDT

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:22am EDT
apply to all the places

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:22am EDT
basically

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:23am EDT
i'd probably end up just literally asking for the manager

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:23am EDT
and sking them specifically

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:23am EDT
theyd either be like dafuq is this guy doing

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:23am EDT
and kick me out

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:23am EDT
or be like this guy has motivation

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:23am EDT
and i'd have an actual chance

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:25am EDT
because there is so much bullshit to go through with big stores

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:25am EDT
yeah that's true

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:25am EDT
i'd never tell the employee i want to see the manager about a job though

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:25am EDT
because they wold just blow me off

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:26am EDT
be like 'please apply online yadayadayada'

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:26am EDT
and if i was super rude oby being that way or something... well i'm never gonna se them again so fuck it

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:26am EDT
off course this is me speaking when i actually have a job or 3

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:27am EDT
so i dont count

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:27am EDT
OH

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:27am EDT
If you are super desperate for some money

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:27am EDT
like just something to do when you're bored to make some cash

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:28am EDT
?

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:28am EDT
"MTurk is an Amazon website which allows you to work from home and make some money. The pay isn't very high (way below minimum wage), but you get to work for yourself, on your own free time, for as much as you want, doing only what you want. For example, one of the better jobs (or HITs as they are called) is answering AskVille questions which were'nt answered by AskVillers in 4 hours (just like this one!). Each week the person who answers the most is paid $100 (plus 2 cents per question), and the 29 people after the leader make anywhere between $13 to $97. For most of us, the money really isn't the motivation. Some like to keep busy, some find the tasks to be fun, some like to help others out, etc. If you want to know more about MTurk, I suggest you pay a visit to the website: http://www.mturk.com And also drop by the forums where we discuss everything mturk-related: http://turkers.proboards80.com/ Or, if you have any specific questions, I'll be glad to help."

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:29am EDT
I do this sometimes, I've made like $20 over the past 3 months

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:29am EDT
but I've only worked like 3 hours

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:30am EDT
because I got bored

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:30am EDT
considering my tuesdays and thursdays i do literally nothing this will probably be a thing i do to keep me busy lol thanks

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:30am EDT

yes

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:34am EDT
completely

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:35am EDT
i mean you'd be making less than minimum wage most likely if yu tried it as a full time thing

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:35am EDT
but you could easily make a hundred or two per month

Steph DudakFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:36am EDT
definitely like i said it's something to keep me busy if i feel like it so

Nick DevlinFriday, May 31, 2013 at 1:36am EDT
