Nick DevlinSunday, June 3, 2012 at 10:07pm EDT
physical intimacy vs emotional

Nick DevlinSunday, June 3, 2012 at 10:08pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, June 7, 2012 at 3:52pm EDT
a server is just a map where you play in multiplayer

Nick DevlinThursday, June 7, 2012 at 3:52pm EDT
it's kind of like a chatroom

Nick DevlinThursday, June 7, 2012 at 3:53pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, June 7, 2012 at 3:53pm EDT

the powder blue

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 12, 2012 at 10:16pm EDT
black and silver would be badass

"The enthused barbarian swilveled about, his shock of fiery red hair tossing robustly in the humid air currents as he faced the attack of the defeated soldier's fellow in arms."

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 3:32pm EDT
I just got to like the 3rd sentence

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 3:33pm EDT
i can't even read this lol

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
It makes almost no sense

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 3:34pm EDT
It's just a bunch of incorretly used vocab words

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 3:35pm EDT
too much too much aaah

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 3:47pm EDT
yeah I'll be reading this out loud first as practice

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 4:03pm EDT
Hahaha excellent

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 4:52pm EDT
i know nothing about computers

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 4:52pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 4:53pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 4:54pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 4:54pm EDT
do you have verizon

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 4:54pm EDT
comcast ova here

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 4:55pm EDT
i haven't playeed wow in a while. and i got new shoulders from LFR. the old shoulders i had, plus the chestpiece granted a bonus of judgement granting 1 holy power. now i just changed the shoulders which means i dont have that bonus and dps will be less because it's less fast templar's verdicts need pants nao aaaagh needed someone to complain to

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 4:55pm EDT
about that

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 4:55pm EDT
anywho

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 4:56pm EDT
That's annoying

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 4:56pm EDT
how much work will it be to get the better armour back/

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 4:56pm EDT
well the thing is

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 4:57pm EDT
like okay these shoulders are better stat wise . that's why i'm switching. i'm currently wearing last tiers legs. they're 378. LFR is 384, and regular raids is like 391 or something like that but my guild sucks and never raids and i haven't had time to even tdo that. BUT ANYWAY. i need to win the token to get the legs, and that all depends on who's in my LFR group

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 4:57pm EDT
because the token i need to get is shared by paladins, priests, and i think warlocks

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 4:58pm EDT
so the less of those are in the group, the better chance i have of gettin em, i've been trying to get em for too long

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 4:59pm EDT
why haven't you joined a better guild

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 5:00pm EDT
because i have an attachment to this one

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 5:00pm EDT
i've been in this guild since i started playing and know a lot of the people fairly well and it'd just be weird to me I'm also an officer here and i haven't been on a lot in the last few months

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 5:00pm EDT
i have a feeling some others haven't been either though

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 5:07pm EDT
i understand

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 5:07pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 5:53pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:18pm EDT
sigh

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:18pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:18pm EDT
and i'm kind of meh about this whole relationship thing we got goin on

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:19pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:19pm EDT
it is

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:19pm EDT
you got any plans about what to do?

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:19pm EDT
i kind of want to break up with him. buuut i need to figure out how to do it without ruining a lot of things

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:20pm EDT
maybe if all our friends weren't involved in our relationship it wouldn't be half as bad

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:20pm EDT
and maybe if it werent laurie's biggest life accomplishment

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:20pm EDT
idk if i'm being like

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:20pm EDT
weird or if i really just don't like him

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:20pm EDT
like that

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:20pm EDT
hmm, well what have you two done together, like have you gone on any dates?

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:21pm EDT
yeah we've been out quite a few times together and they were fine

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:21pm EDT
but like

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:21pm EDT
i can't look at him in the eyes a lot of the times which is bad

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:21pm EDT
like prom

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:22pm EDT
aww

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:22pm EDT
that's cute and sad

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:22pm EDT
i stared at alayna until she left me pretty much..

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:23pm EDT
i felt chris shake before he kissed me.. and i've prevented him from kissing me before

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:23pm EDT
it sounds like you just don't wanna be in a relationship

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:24pm EDT
i just don't want to be in a relationship with him

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:24pm EDT
he's a great guy and he's super nice and whatever But i just don't think we fit well together yaknow. like

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:24pm EDT
I understand

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:24pm EDT
i shouldnt have a problem kissing my boyfriend ??

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:24pm EDT
I don't think that should be a problem

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:25pm EDT
although sara does tend to hiss when i kiss her sometimes...

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:25pm EDT
thhat's weird

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:25pm EDT
but whatever

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:25pm EDT
XD

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:26pm EDT
yeah I'd say stop now if you really don't think it's gonna work out

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:26pm EDT
that's kinda funny But yeah it's just weird. i can point out things that bother me and i'm not that comfortable around him i guess. and i don't wanna wait too long because i don't wanna make it worse

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:26pm EDT
it makes it less awkward later

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:26pm EDT
exactly

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:27pm EDT
I hope you are able to go back to being friends

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:27pm EDT
if you can everything works out

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:27pm EDT
me too /:

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:28pm EDT
How into the relationship is he?

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:28pm EDT
because if it's too much there's little hope

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:28pm EDT
did you read that truth

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:28pm EDT
i'm not confident we'll be okay after

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:29pm EDT
you will be less friends than before I'd say

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:29pm EDT
but I think the friendship is still salvageable

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:30pm EDT
it'd be less painful

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:30pm EDT
if other people weren't so involved

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:30pm EDT
and if

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:30pm EDT
his mother didn't already basically love me despite not having formally formally metme

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:30pm EDT
i've met her before

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:31pm EDT
i wouldn't worry so much about parents

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:31pm EDT
and she asks how i am and stuff if i'm on skype with him I know but

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:31pm EDT
that makes me feel awkawrd

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:31pm EDT
awkward

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:31pm EDT
she's really nice to me

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:31pm EDT
yeah, it's going to be weird no matter when you break up

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:31pm EDT
it just gets worse every day though

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:31pm EDT
also do it in person

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:32pm EDT
and explain everything

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:32pm EDT
every single detail of why

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:32pm EDT
yeah

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:32pm EDT
i know

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:32pm EDT
i planned to do it in person

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:33pm EDT
what else is there... hmm I wish I had liked quigley mor eso I knew what would have been something I wish she had done when she broke up with me

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:34pm EDT
I was kind of waiting for it so I didn't care much

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:34pm EDT
idk steph

Nick DevlinThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:34pm EDT
good luck is all i know

Steph DudakThursday, June 14, 2012 at 8:34pm EDT

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 19, 2012 at 11:22pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, June 19, 2012 at 11:23pm EDT

Steph DudakTuesday, June 19, 2012 at 11:23pm EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, June 22, 2012 at 6:50pm EDT
here ya go

Nick DevlinFriday, June 22, 2012 at 6:50pm EDT
Here is your story That you HAVE to read IN A SCOTTISH ACCENT! Have fun with that yo. cause this story (if you can call it that) is waak and makes no sense. YAY FOR NONSENSE! NOW OPEN. Hello. My name is George. Im half giraffe, and hald raccoon. Crazy right? Well thats not necessarily true Im also partly human. Wack. I was born in 8732 in a small town in Zimbabwe. I dont remember the name of that town, but I hated it there. Boy did I hate it. Everyone there was mean and judgemental and I wasnt accepted as the giraccman I am. As you may have guessed, I moved away. Now where do I live? I dont live anywhere in particular. Why, may you ask? Simply because now Im a part of a travelling circus. Come see the great fascinating Giraccman! Yeah I guess this isnt too great either. But these other circus freaks accept me, cause theyre pretty different themselves. At least Im cooler than that bearded lady over there Shes probably the tenth one Ive met. Way to be original. Anyone can grow a beard. But me? No. I just own all these weirdos. And one day, I will be supreme ruler of the world!

Nick DevlinFriday, June 22, 2012 at 6:50pm EDT
yeah

Nick DevlinFriday, June 22, 2012 at 6:50pm EDT
you're a freak

Nick DevlinFriday, June 22, 2012 at 6:50pm EDT
nah, this was awesome

Steph DudakFriday, June 22, 2012 at 6:52pm EDT

Steph DudakFriday, June 22, 2012 at 7:30pm EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, June 22, 2012 at 7:30pm EDT

Nick DevlinFriday, June 22, 2012 at 9:40pm EDT
What are the chances that I could invite dachelle to a charity juggling event an hour away on Sunday?

Nick DevlinFriday, June 22, 2012 at 9:41pm EDT

Steph DudakFriday, June 22, 2012 at 9:41pm EDT

Steph DudakFriday, June 22, 2012 at 9:41pm EDT

of course

Steph DudakTuesday, June 26, 2012 at 10:26pm EDT
you may need to work on it a litttttle bit but hahaha that was entertaining to listen to

Steph DudakTuesday, June 26, 2012 at 10:26pm EDT
the first one barely sounds like you

Steph DudakTuesday, June 26, 2012 at 10:26pm EDT
hahahahaha

Steph DudakTuesday, June 26, 2012 at 10:26pm EDT
cause he's a major fucking hottie

Steph DudakTuesday, June 26, 2012 at 10:26pm EDT
i'm listening to the 2nd test

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 26, 2012 at 10:26pm EDT
alright

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 26, 2012 at 10:26pm EDT
I think that one is completely different

Steph DudakTuesday, June 26, 2012 at 10:27pm EDT
it is

Steph DudakTuesday, June 26, 2012 at 10:27pm EDT
hahaha

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 26, 2012 at 10:27pm EDT
i couldn't decide. Big announcer voice, then use retarded girl voice for dialogue. Or just be constantly in retarded girl voice because she is narrorating

Steph DudakTuesday, June 26, 2012 at 10:28pm EDT
i think you should do whatever you're more comfortable doing and what's easier for you to do

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 26, 2012 at 10:28pm EDT
but i'm mainly concerned with which is more amusing

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 26, 2012 at 10:29pm EDT
since i'm fine with either

Steph DudakTuesday, June 26, 2012 at 10:29pm EDT
they're equally amusing lol just because the 2nd one sounds like you, and hearing you say major fucking hottie in a voice that's really similar to yours

Steph DudakTuesday, June 26, 2012 at 10:29pm EDT
is hilarious to me

Steph DudakTuesday, June 26, 2012 at 10:29pm EDT
cause you obviously don't say things like that hahahaha

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 26, 2012 at 10:29pm EDT
yeah -.-

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 26, 2012 at 10:30pm EDT
hmm

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 26, 2012 at 10:31pm EDT
The thing is, narrator voice #2 is more consistent, but #4 is easier to distinguish dialogue, plus the contrast is amusing

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 26, 2012 at 10:31pm EDT
and only people who know me will see this so #2 might be funnier

Steph DudakTuesday, June 26, 2012 at 10:32pm EDT
send it to another person for a second opinion lol

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 26, 2012 at 10:32pm EDT
who?

Steph DudakTuesday, June 26, 2012 at 10:32pm EDT
difficult to decide

Steph DudakTuesday, June 26, 2012 at 10:32pm EDT
julie? kerry? laurie?

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 26, 2012 at 10:32pm EDT
I think this will be kerry's present so that wouldn't work.

Nick DevlinTuesday, June 26, 2012 at 10:33pm EDT
I'll read like the first 5 chapters for her or something then add silly video

Steph DudakTuesday, June 26, 2012 at 10:33pm EDT
