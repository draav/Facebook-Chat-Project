Steph DudakSaturday, August 25, 2012 at 11:28pm EDT
Whatever The next class we practiced drawing straight lines on 18x24 paper with charcoal and we did more still life stuff. This one

Steph DudakSaturday, August 25, 2012 at 11:29pm EDT
This one okay we were like not allowed to pick up the pencil and it was to like get the feeeeel of what we were drawing and don't look at the paper

Steph DudakSaturday, August 25, 2012 at 11:29pm EDT
Just let your hand draw

Steph DudakSaturday, August 25, 2012 at 11:29pm EDT
Fine whatever

Steph DudakSaturday, August 25, 2012 at 11:29pm EDT
And he was getting like agitated at some people She even pointed out something to me when I wasn't even fucking done.

Steph DudakSaturday, August 25, 2012 at 11:29pm EDT
Like it was this broom and it was like bunched up and tied in a million different little things in the bottom

Steph DudakSaturday, August 25, 2012 at 11:31pm EDT
And I just drew like the general broom shape thing whatever idek and THIS BITCH was like you see how each thing is like tied up individually yeah you should show that and I'm like nigga NO FUCKING SHIT IM NOT DONE YET

Steph DudakSaturday, August 25, 2012 at 11:31pm EDT
Whatever.

Steph DudakSaturday, August 25, 2012 at 11:31pm EDT
So then

Steph DudakSaturday, August 25, 2012 at 11:32pm EDT
End of he dreadful three hour class. And she was like So I went through your still life's and they were horrible

Steph DudakSaturday, August 25, 2012 at 11:32pm EDT
She literally said that

Steph DudakSaturday, August 25, 2012 at 11:32pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, August 25, 2012 at 11:33pm EDT
I still need to draw two still life's Due Monday I've been putting it off bc I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE ACTUALLY WANTS

Steph DudakSaturday, August 25, 2012 at 11:33pm EDT

Nick DevlinSaturday, August 25, 2012 at 11:34pm EDT
if annoing as hell

Steph DudakSaturday, August 25, 2012 at 11:34pm EDT
My math teacher is nothing like dziedzic

Steph DudakSaturday, August 25, 2012 at 11:34pm EDT
It's sad

Steph DudakSaturday, August 25, 2012 at 11:35pm EDT
I'm assuming things will be more challenging for me when I start doing actual calc stuff because we've only just done like algebra review and simple limits

Steph DudakSaturday, August 25, 2012 at 11:35pm EDT
Uhhhhh

Steph DudakSaturday, August 25, 2012 at 11:36pm EDT
My writing teacher is cool. He's from north Carolina and has a slight southern accent sometimes and says y'all a lot and reminds me of Neil Patrick Harris

Steph DudakSaturday, August 25, 2012 at 11:36pm EDT
I like pat too. She's my environmental science teacher.

Nick DevlinSaturday, August 25, 2012 at 11:36pm EDT

Steph DudakSaturday, August 25, 2012 at 11:36pm EDT
She seems like she's a good teacher we haven't done that much yet

Steph DudakSaturday, August 25, 2012 at 11:36pm EDT
But shes not boring

Nick DevlinSaturday, August 25, 2012 at 11:36pm EDT

Steph DudakFriday, August 31, 2012 at 12:42pm EDT
Idk what that is but it sounds like really bad porn

Nick DevlinFriday, August 31, 2012 at 1:01pm EDT
I'm assuming so as well.

Nick DevlinFriday, August 31, 2012 at 1:03pm EDT
So what are you up to today? Any idea of how things are gonna work out

Nick DevlinFriday, August 31, 2012 at 1:04pm EDT
just so I can try to find a way fo you and sara to see eachother

Steph DudakFriday, August 31, 2012 at 1:05pm EDT
I don't even know. I'm worried about being able to see my family at this point -.-. I have two models and a paper with a plan, section, and elevation drawing due tuesday for my shoe project. and i'm doing those little boots i have, i have to make a model of that out of cardboard and it is the biggest pain in the ass ever. so i gotta do all that at home. i'm most likely not gonna actually be in toms river til like 4 or after 4 probably

Steph DudakFriday, August 31, 2012 at 1:06pm EDT
if mom hasnt left yet shes leaving soon, it'll take her 1.5, probably closer to 2 hours to get here. so figure 3 so i won't actually be around til maybe 5.

Nick DevlinFriday, August 31, 2012 at 1:06pm EDT
It's like college is tons of work or something god

Nick DevlinFriday, August 31, 2012 at 1:06pm EDT
so annoying

Steph DudakFriday, August 31, 2012 at 1:06pm EDT
i'm sick of it already there are no such things as breaks when you have design

Nick DevlinFriday, August 31, 2012 at 1:06pm EDT
i can imagine

Steph DudakFriday, August 31, 2012 at 1:06pm EDT
ill be spending all my time in studio i can bet and it sucks

Steph DudakFriday, August 31, 2012 at 1:07pm EDT
the only good thing is that originally i was gonna have to have all four models due tuesday

Steph DudakFriday, August 31, 2012 at 1:07pm EDT
and she shortened it to just the two instead

Steph DudakFriday, August 31, 2012 at 1:07pm EDT
so i'm thankful for that but i still have a lot of shit to do

Nick DevlinFriday, August 31, 2012 at 1:08pm EDT
That sucks, but at least this isn't new to you. You done it before! And everything went awesomely

Steph DudakFriday, August 31, 2012 at 1:08pm EDT
that's the thing it's good that i'm used to it

Steph DudakFriday, August 31, 2012 at 1:08pm EDT
but i don't want a repeat of senior year cause that shit sucked

Steph DudakFriday, August 31, 2012 at 1:08pm EDT
AND

Steph DudakFriday, August 31, 2012 at 1:08pm EDT
