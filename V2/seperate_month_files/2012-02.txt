Steph DudakWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:31pm EST
so all of her financial information and i had to explain in this section that she contributes to house stuff and other payments and whatever but the house & everything is in my old mans name.

Steph DudakWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:32pm EST

Steph DudakWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:35pm EST
Thank you for your interest in Rensselaer! We know how important financial aid can be in the college decision-making process. Rensselaer's Office of Financial Aid wants to make sure you have the opportunity to receive the best financial aid package we can offer. You don't want to wait until you receive a decision on your admission to apply for financial aid. This way, should you be accepted, we will be able to provide you with your admission results and your financial aid package at the same time. If you have not already done so, you must complete the 2012-2013 CSS (College Scholarship Service) PROFILE application for us to fully evaluate your eligibility for our Rensselaer grants and campus-based aid programs. In addition, all federal aid programs require the completion of the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid). Both the PROFILE application and FAFSA can be done immediately. Our priority filing deadline for these applications in order to ensure that you receive your financial aid, should you be accepted at Rensselaer, is 2/1/2012. Here are the websites for you to visit for more information: CSS PROFILE: https://profileonline.collegeboard.com. (Our school code is 2757) FAFSA: www.fafsa.gov (Our school code is 002803) There is no charge to file the FAFSA. Depending on family income and assets, CSS Profile may allow you file the application without paying a fee. The Institute last year provided $80 million of its own funding to students to make Rensselaer an affordable investment. We encourage you to complete these applications as soon as possible. Warm regards, Office of Financial Aid

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:35pm EST
yes i've seen that one before

Steph DudakWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:35pm EST
specifically Both the PROFILE application and FAFSA can be done immediately. Our priority filing deadline for these applications in order to ensure that you receive your financial aid, should you be accepted at Rensselaer, is 2/1/2012.

Steph DudakWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:35pm EST
that section

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:36pm EST
i don't think that one applies to you

Steph DudakWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:36pm EST
what do you mean

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:36pm EST
nevermind

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:36pm EST

Steph DudakWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:36pm EST
im saying for the FAFSA

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:37pm EST
yeah i gotcha

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:37pm EST
it does say priority deadline

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:37pm EST
that means if you fill it out any later you will not be a priority

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:38pm EST
they will get around to you whenever they feel like

Steph DudakWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:38pm EST
but i can fill it out later

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:38pm EST

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:38pm EST

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:39pm EST

Steph DudakWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:39pm EST

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:49pm EST
well it turns out i got a B

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:49pm EST
do you know why?

Steph DudakWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:50pm EST
nope

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:50pm EST
well it turns out she did not write down that I did my essay

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:50pm EST
which she told me I got credit for

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:50pm EST
i even asked about 3 times

Steph DudakWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:50pm EST
i'd demand she fix it

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:50pm EST
and she said I was good

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:50pm EST
which means

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
i askedd

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
then i asked again

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
and went back later

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
and asked

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
she said it was impossible

Steph DudakWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
what?

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
I'm gonna go ask guidance tomorrow and prove to her that it isn't

Steph DudakWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
it's not impossible.

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
exactly

Steph DudakWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
i've gotten a grade change

Steph DudakWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
it's her fault

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
thus the reason for my annoyance

Steph DudakWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
she was an idiot

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:51pm EST
therefore not my fault

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:52pm EST
and i shouldn';t have to take her final

Steph DudakWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:52pm EST
would you have had an A with that assignment in?

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:54pm EST
I am not sure it was worth a lot of points

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:54pm EST
I want to ask her that before i go to guidance

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:54pm EST
just so i don't make a ton of trouble for an 88 instead of an 86

Steph DudakWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:54pm EST
yeah that'd be bad

Steph DudakWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:54pm EST
but if it counted as more than one grade and you did good on it

Steph DudakWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:54pm EST
an 86 was your grade?

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:55pm EST
yeah

Nick DevlinWednesday, February 1, 2012 at 9:58pm EST

Nick DevlinSunday, February 5, 2012 at 11:06am EST

Nick DevlinSunday, February 5, 2012 at 11:07am EST

Nick DevlinSunday, February 5, 2012 at 11:08am EST

Steph DudakSunday, February 5, 2012 at 11:46am EST
gotchhhha gotcha. how much ya have done so far?

Nick DevlinSunday, February 5, 2012 at 11:46am EST
When I was very young I loved exploring the forest behind my house. Of course some might disagree with the idea that a dozen or so trees and a small stream constituted as a forest, but I was young, with the imagination of a child. I spent every day there searching for interesting rocks in the clean transparent water of the stream. I had a rule that I would never dig for rocks, only pick up ones I saw on the surface. By the time I was ten I had amassed a collection of rocks large enough to be the envy of any geologist. They were hoarded away in a secret section my closet. It was only a secret because the mess was too much for even the most fearless parent to venture into.

Nick DevlinSunday, February 5, 2012 at 11:46am EST
not very

Nick DevlinSunday, February 5, 2012 at 11:46am EST
far

Nick DevlinSunday, February 5, 2012 at 11:47am EST

Nick DevlinSunday, February 5, 2012 at 12:04pm EST
do you know how to use semicolons/ colons

Nick DevlinSunday, February 5, 2012 at 12:04pm EST
i think i need one

Nick DevlinSunday, February 5, 2012 at 12:09pm EST
Although it may have seemed unorganized to the untrained eye, there was a very complex classification system based on the most important aspects of any item in a child’s collection: varying levels of how cool and or awesome the items were.

Nick DevlinSunday, February 5, 2012 at 12:09pm EST
is that right?

Steph DudakSunday, February 5, 2012 at 12:09pm EST
Semicolons (;) Use a semicolon to separate two main clauses not joined by a coordinating conjunction: Those who write clearly have readers; those who write obscurely have commentators. We can also use a semicolon to separate main clauses joined by a conjunctive adverb (such as however, consequently, otherwise, moreover, nevertheless): A great many people may think that they are thinking; however, most are merely rearranging their prejudices. Basically, a semicolon (whether followed by a conjunctive adverb or not) serves to coordinate two main clauses. For a more detailed discussion of this mark, see How to Use the Semicolon. Colons (:) Use a colon to set off a summary or a series after a complete main clause: It is time for the baby's birthday party: a white cake, strawberry-marshmellow ice cream, and a bottle of champagne saved from another party. (Joan Didion) Notice that a main clause does not have to follow the colon; however, a complete main clause generally should precede it.

Steph DudakSunday, February 5, 2012 at 12:10pm EST
colons, think list

Steph DudakSunday, February 5, 2012 at 12:10pm EST
semi colon, both sides can stand alone

Nick DevlinSunday, February 5, 2012 at 12:11pm EST
everythinng else is a semicolon

Nick DevlinSunday, February 5, 2012 at 12:11pm EST
i do not know what a main clause is

Nick DevlinSunday, February 5, 2012 at 12:11pm EST
or a conjunction

Nick DevlinSunday, February 5, 2012 at 12:11pm EST
haven't learned grammar since middle school

Steph DudakSunday, February 5, 2012 at 12:12pm EST
main clause, um independent clause. its basically just a sentence conjunctions and or but etc

Nick DevlinSunday, February 5, 2012 at 12:13pm EST
ah right conujctions i remember

Nick DevlinSunday, February 5, 2012 at 12:13pm EST
and let me restate that first complaint

Nick DevlinSunday, February 5, 2012 at 12:13pm EST
i do not know what a clause is

Steph DudakSunday, February 5, 2012 at 12:15pm EST
http://www.chompchomp.com/terms/clause.htm

Nick DevlinSunday, February 5, 2012 at 12:18pm EST

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:06pm EST

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:07pm EST

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:07pm EST
i don't know

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
nicholas i am really mad

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:08pm EST
because?

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
i want to draw and stuff but i'm so uninspired to do so. i was in art today brainstorming ideas for my concentration and seeing what pieces i already have that fit into the theme of what lies beneath the surface / that being brought forward and i have like 4 pieces that fit that maybe. like. i guess the tear one, the hand, the confused one can fit that... I have that zipper face one i started but dunno how to finish so that's 4. i wanna redo that faceless one. but if that's the theme it also doesn't have to be just people but idk

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
IDK

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
i wanna sit down and draw but idk what i even wanna do anymore

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:10pm EST
that is one of the more frustrating things i've heard in my life

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
it's so upsetting!

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
all right

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
so

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
and what's even more upsetting is i see all this awesome art when i'm going through tumblr for inspiration

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
what i will do

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
and it's all so great and i'm like why can i not

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
what the heck

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
this is so good

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
steph

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
but it is not inspiring me to do anything

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
sorry

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
sorry

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:12pm EST
never judge yourself based on others

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:13pm EST
you will end up in a ball on the ground

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:13pm EST
then see some asian kid on youtube

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:13pm EST
that does it 10X better and give that up too

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:13pm EST
true

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:14pm EST
it's not so much judging myself based off others as it is Seeing really awesome stuff but having like, artist block i guess you'd call it, myself.

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:14pm EST
makes sense

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:14pm EST
i'm about to start getting like that with juggling

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:14pm EST
talent show is soon

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:14pm EST
i havent even thought about it

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:15pm EST
soon i'll be complaining about it all the time dont you worry

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:15pm EST
but your current annoyance

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:15pm EST
is not easily solved

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:17pm EST
): that's frustrating. you'll figure it out. when is the talent show though? it shouldn't be so hard though. i guess i also have a problem with not finishing things too cause i think i'll ruin them. i need to get around to copying some of my things so i can get on that and test things on different versions. i should get some sort of paints and practice though so i can do that melty eye thing because it never works with pencils when i attempt

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:18pm EST
( btw http://coolyourjetsyo.tumblr.com/tagged/art that heart on there. made out of wood. is awesome. )

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:19pm EST
why don't you scan or take pictures of what you make, then reprint the drawings to mess with?

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:19pm EST
that's what i just said

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:19pm EST
just not as simply

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:19pm EST

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:20pm EST

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:20pm EST
and was concerned for your mental health

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:20pm EST
but i'm glad you didnt mean that

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:21pm EST

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:28pm EST

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:28pm EST
along with http://coolyourjetsyo.tumblr.com/tagged/kitten i have like 8436 kitten tags... kitten, cat, cats, kittens. I'm bad with tags, i should make it all into one thing even though i'm sure they all contain basically the same pictures

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:29pm EST
the only thing i tagged was that 30 day challenge that took 90 days this summer

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:30pm EST
not that ive gone on tumblr in the past month in order to tag stuff

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:30pm EST
too lazy to go back and fix my tags though yeah lol i've recently started tagging stuff so i can go back and look at it when i need to

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:31pm EST

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:31pm EST

no ones last names, if they have any, are mentioned, are they?

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:45pm EST
aside from toph

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:46pm EST
i can't remember any

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
i feel like toph has one for being in the upper

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
class

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
but zuko should have one too then

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
maybe upper class earth kingdom has it only?

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:47pm EST
or they just never thought about it

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:49pm EST
hm maybe

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:49pm EST
it kind of bothers me a little bit

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:50pm EST
here best explanation i found

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:50pm EST
Aang has no last name but has a title: Avatar Aang. Katara and Sokka are peasants. They don't have a family name. Toph is the child of Earth Kingdom nobles and the nobility always has a family name. If the Fire Nation is based on the monarchy of Japan, then Zuko and Azula don't technically need a family name. The Japanese Royal Family has no family name due to historical reasons yet they do have other names.

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:50pm EST
oh well i guess that makes sense

Steph DudakTuesday, February 7, 2012 at 8:50pm EST

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:47am EST
i don't know how i'm going to do all those layers before it to make it better

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:48am EST
i had another idea to do a sort of aerial view of a persons head, and have it open and all sorts of designs and things coming out of it i suppose. so we're gonna try to draw that again

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:49am EST
i wish i could draw people. it's something i really need to practice. cause i still have that whole lightbulb for a head idea filled with lightbulbs but a crack so theres a trail of a bunch of other lightbulbs.

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:49am EST
which looks cool in my head

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:49am EST
but

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:49am EST
you know

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:49am EST
yeah

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:49am EST
that's how it always is

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:50am EST
i feel like i can't set a concentration. i dont know if any of this stuff can fit into my concentration

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:50am EST
i feel like.. it could all fit. but all of it would need explaining.

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:50am EST
i could never deal with that class

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:50am EST
obviously i'm not going to make every piece be someone or something tearing something in front of them away

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:50am EST
to show what's really inside them or whatever

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:51am EST
i feel like the hand and butterfly thing could fit. the brain thing. the faceless thing. even that confused one with the arrows wrapping around it.

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:51am EST
it all makes sense in my head but that's usually the problem.

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:51am EST
http://www.psychicdonut.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/open_mind.jpg

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:51am EST
that looks like it'd fit

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:51am EST
i just saw it while googling

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:52am EST
that's pretty cool

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:52am EST
but yaknow what i mean

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:52am EST
i still gotta redo that three section thin

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:52am EST
g

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:52am EST
over again

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:53am EST
switch the left and right sides and figure out patterns

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:53am EST
you know what else?

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:53am EST
hm?

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:53am EST
i bought two sketchbooks that were labeled 9"x12" and they are definitely not that size

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:53am EST
it doesn't matter

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:53am EST
but it's false advertising

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:53am EST
hhaha

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:53am EST
i had a 9x12 sketchbook and i actually prefer that size paper because it's not too big and not too small ya know

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:53am EST
those bastards

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:53am EST
that white one

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:54am EST
but it is NOT THE SAME SIZE as these green ones

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:54am EST
i think i know it

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:54am EST
they're more like 8x11

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:54am EST
sue them

i also had ideas for breadth pieces to do some things based off some edgar allan poe stuff.

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:58am EST
but. we'll see. IDK. i can't stand anything right now. i don't want to do anything. first world problems.

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 11:59am EST
those sound fun

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 12:00pm EST
people need to stop complaining omg

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 12:00pm EST
that's kind of complaining isnt it

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 12:01pm EST
but look at this

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 12:01pm EST
Domenick Sborea I never understood why everyone hated this town, but I finally understand. You're all severely immature. You hold grudges over the simplest things, and you destroy friendships. I understand it's fun to argue, but seriously, get over it. It's just added stress to our already unstable minds Like · · 12 minutes ago via mobile · Kristie Melega and 10 others like this.

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 12:08pm EST
unfortunately i have to make a good version for real because i realize how many errors are in my original ;(

papers suck

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:02pm EST
i don't even know what to write

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:02pm EST
kill me please

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:34pm EST
I WOULD

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:34pm EST
but my caps were on

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:34pm EST
so it seems less like sarcasnm

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:34pm EST
and more like eagerness

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:35pm EST
so that's creepy

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:35pm EST
whats the paper for?

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:35pm EST
;__; Act three of othello analysis using five perspectives

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:35pm EST
Those green papers

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:35pm EST
BURN THEM

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:36pm EST
I WANT TO

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:36pm EST
SO BADLY I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO START WRITING THIS THING UGH

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:36pm EST
ummm

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:36pm EST
have you picked 5 perspectives?

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:37pm EST
I don't even think five can be applied to act tree

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:37pm EST
Three

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:37pm EST
Lets see

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:37pm EST
I'm gonna use

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:38pm EST
Feminist perspective

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:38pm EST
Cultural perspective

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:38pm EST
Mythological

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:39pm EST
do mythological first

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:39pm EST
i understand mythology

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:39pm EST
It's not mythology exactly

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:39pm EST
well religious aaspects then

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:39pm EST
or supernatural occurence

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:39pm EST
or superstition

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:39pm EST
whatever it is

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:41pm EST
Mythological perspective is concerned with stories that provide universal story patterns that recur with regularity among many cultures and in many different times and places. Archetypes. Things like familiar patterns of human action like dying/being born, growing up. Example is in Hamlet Hamlets revenge of his fathers death can be linked with myths from other cultures that include a sons avenging his father Themes of love and deception for example in othello

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:43pm EST
thats not mythology

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:43pm EST
but what do i know

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:43pm EST
i dont have a green sheet

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:44pm EST
Or the little essay thing that talks about the perspective

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:45pm EST
I guess I'll use new historical and historical as well then.

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 7:47pm EST
sounds relevant to me

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 8:01pm EST
This is why i dislike hand drawing

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
how am i supposed to test different colours?

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
i don't know why i forgot to send that sentence for 10 minutes

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
have you progressed on your essay thing

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 8:09pm EST
?

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 8:29pm EST
Not really And you use another paper

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 8:29pm EST
Color with the colors you want next to each other and if they look good use em

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 9:14pm EST
that is a good idea

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 9:14pm EST
oh well lessons for the future

Steph DudakMonday, February 20, 2012 at 9:15pm EST
I can't believe she wants me to use five perspectives. Thank god I write big and don't need to type everything for that class

Nick DevlinMonday, February 20, 2012 at 9:18pm EST
that is a useful skill

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:36pm EST
I don't think I'll be sleeping tonight

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
how much have you done?

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
or rather

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:39pm EST
how much is left to do?

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:41pm EST
Too much. I don't even know what to do anymore This one I was doing was goin really well. I have a lightbulb in place of a head and the paintbrush is glowing and such and he's got a thought bubble comin out his lightbulb But idk what to put in the thought bubble. I might try to fill it with nonsense. But idk what else to do And I only thought too late that I wanted to try to do a typography thing based off The Raven, using the poem to do it of course

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
typography is always fun

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
but time consuming offline

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
put a fancy pattern in the thought bubble

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
some kind of explosiony looking thing

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
Time consuming online I already tried to start it and didn get far

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
nothing real

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
Didn't ^

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
*

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:44pm EST
i got that

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
what exactly you tryin to do?

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
Think of two other things I can at least start

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
I'm not worried about this lightbulb thing bc I like it so far

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
Although originally I drew it intending for it to be representative of running out of ideas

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
But then I made the inside glow

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:48pm EST
And lightbulbs don't turn on when you don't have ideas

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:48pm EST
so obviously they have an idea

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
You know what's unfortunate is I don't think this one would fit into my concentration

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
Just a breadth piece.

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
And I need a ton more concentration pieces. Then I was thinking I could do things other than people for my concentration

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:50pm EST
But because I feel the majority is people I'm not sure how I'd make a transition into something else

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:51pm EST
your concentration is under the surface or something similar right?

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:51pm EST
Yeah what's beneath being shown on the surface

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:52pm EST
Which is how I can get away with keeping some of my other things in there

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:53pm EST
what else has surfaces?

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:53pm EST
landscapes

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:53pm EST
I get stuck too much and I'm not confident enough in my own abilities and I wish I had paint at my disposal

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:53pm EST
Yeah nature

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:53pm EST
bubbles

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:53pm EST
i like bubbles

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:54pm EST
That just makes me think of tree people for some reason when I think about transitioning in this concentration

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:54pm EST
haha

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:54pm EST
i erally dont want to do people

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:54pm EST
Cause then I have that butterfly thing

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:54pm EST
how about trees?

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:54pm EST
I SHOULD DO TREE PEOPLE

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:54pm EST
...

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:54pm EST
sorry

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:55pm EST
thats what just went through my head

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:55pm EST
XD

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:55pm EST
please forgive me

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:55pm EST
awesome i'm assuming that's yes i'm forgiven

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:56pm EST
Yes

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:56pm EST
so nature is a good them to include

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:57pm EST
obviously emotions would be a theme

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:58pm EST
i tend to think geometrically, like surface area

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:58pm EST
i know its irrelevant but hey maybe not

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:58pm EST
I should turn my math homework into an art project ugh

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:59pm EST
I've always wanted to do something with like geometric shapes and stuff but never had an actual idea or way to go about it

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:59pm EST
i keep thinking

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:59pm EST
illlusionary type objects

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 10:59pm EST
that seems normal at first glance, but when you take a closer look are impossible

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 11:01pm EST
Those are cool

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 11:02pm EST
how you could integrate them into a piece, i'm not sure

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 11:02pm EST
Maybe making a scene in nature but using this style everything would be all abstract

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 11:02pm EST
trees would work, maybe the branches could be this fucked up illusionary shit

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 11:02pm EST
idk

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 11:03pm EST
That's something I'll try to work with when I have time. Trees can be fun

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 11:03pm EST
or you just stick with the math homework idea, one the surface it seems impossible and senseless, but when you look further in you realize that some things really are the way they appear

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 11:04pm EST
The math I do in class, even though it looks ridiculous, can be applied to actual situations It's ridiculous Meanwhile using the number e

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 11:06pm EST
haha, e

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 11:06pm EST
i see that all the time in cool equations

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 11:11pm EST
Yeah it's just lovely

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 11:13pm EST
well i would never want to actually use it but it looks cool

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 11:13pm EST
like-- I was about to say 'like juggling fire'

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 11:13pm EST
but then i realized i do want to do that

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 11:13pm EST
so its a bad similie

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 11:14pm EST
I understand Nicholas

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 11:17pm EST
thank you

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 11:18pm EST
so yeah, that geometrically decieving surface might work

Steph DudakTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 11:20pm EST
I'll try it sometime

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 11:20pm EST
but for cirrent work

Nick DevlinTuesday, February 21, 2012 at 11:20pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:02pm EST
and give you shiny things?

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:04pm EST
it's a 4yr program, 5 for me, that you take seven honors courses (22 credits). "These courses are Honors versions of regularly required courses in the College Studies curriculum and in your major. Classes are designed to provide intellectual challenge to our strongest students and to cover material in greater depth and breadth." "In addition to Honors course work, there are a variety of co-curricular benefits to being an Honors student. Credit can be earned, for example, through community service projects, in internships, or study aboard. There are also regional conferences to which honors students travel to present their work as well as free cultural events, extended library loan periods, and on campus activities"

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:04pm EST
those are the fun things i want to see

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:05pm EST
study abroad!!

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:05pm EST
better classes and cooler event

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:05pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:07pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:07pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:08pm EST
3.0 doesnt seems that hard to maintain at all

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:08pm EST
not at all

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:08pm EST
assuming that's just a normal unweighted 4.0 scale, which duh i mean what else

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:08pm EST
i'll be fine

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:09pm EST
no its out of a scale of 3

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:09pm EST
obviously

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:09pm EST
maybe 2

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:09pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:10pm EST
lmao shut up

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:10pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:14pm EST
the tuition itself for philadelphia university

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:14pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:14pm EST
i understand

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:15pm EST
i'm actually annoyed my mom makes so much money on her own

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:15pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:15pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:16pm EST
oooo

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:59pm EST
do you think i could compress my photoshop folder with the application and everything in it, send it somewhere, decompress it on a different computer and have it work?

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:59pm EST
depends

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:59pm EST
does the other computer have photoshop?

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 3:59pm EST
on?

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:00pm EST
no

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:00pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:00pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:00pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:00pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:00pm EST
labeled photoshop cs4

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:00pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:00pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:01pm EST
the actual application, and other stuff i don't actually understand which is the stuff in the application i guess

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:01pm EST
idk

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:01pm EST
few years

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:01pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:01pm EST
i was gonna say

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:01pm EST
i could test it with you if you want lol

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:02pm EST
i'm curious because

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:02pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:02pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:02pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:05pm EST
the other flaw being

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:06pm EST
too large of a file to send through anywhere or upload on mediafire without an account upgrade

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:06pm EST
can you zip the file?

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:06pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:06pm EST
winrar

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:07pm EST
i already compressed it

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:07pm EST
all i need to do is right click on it and hit compress file and it does it

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:08pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:08pm EST
ah

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:08pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:08pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:08pm EST
that i can easily zip files?

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:08pm EST
that it is too large still

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:09pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:09pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:13pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:15pm EST
Upload in progress 2% 4.36Mb of 223.71Mb 00:00:40 elapsed, 00:38:20 left 141.41Kb/sec (97.9Kb/sec avg)

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:16pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:16pm EST
i shouldn't upload photoshop on there

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:16pm EST
that i illegally downloaded

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:27pm EST
the link you can send to me

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:27pm EST
and it should work

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:28pm EST
im not risking it lol i feel like it'd be too easy to try to upload it there so it'd get taken down

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:28pm EST
you gave up?:

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:29pm EST
yes lol

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:29pm EST
ah well

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:29pm EST
knowing my luck it'd be more than taken down. i'd probably just get thrown in jail or something

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:29pm EST
makes sense to me

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:30pm EST
be the exact opposite of what my family expected

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:30pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:33pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:34pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:35pm EST
HM05=flash in case you wondering

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:35pm EST
noooow one question

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:36pm EST
let's say it works. i can get the files on the flash drive whatever

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:36pm EST
assumption made

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:36pm EST
would the fact that i have this all downloaded on a mac cause problems

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:36pm EST
cause you know. they have PC downloads and mac downloads for these things

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:36pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 4:59pm EST
deleting everything and retrying

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 5:01pm EST
I hope that one works. That'd be really cool. It's a shame that forum no longer exists and I didn't save those links.

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 5:01pm EST
Because it had dreamweaver photoshop and illustrator I think it even had um. One other thing I can't think of that was useless to me

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 5:07pm EST
i remember

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 5:10pm EST
Would be more useful. You can't create 3d text and stuff in photoshop. It's nice to have that and illustrator as well

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 5:10pm EST
Though I can't figure out how to make actual lines in illustrator. Just the paths. Which is ridiculous But anyway

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 5:12pm EST
i am not able to do this

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 5:12pm EST

Ask for photoshop when you graduate Say it's essential to your life And it's the best investment that could be made in you One of them

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 5:15pm EST

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 5:15pm EST

Steph DudakThursday, February 23, 2012 at 5:15pm EST
Yeah I know that's not very realistic lol

Nick DevlinThursday, February 23, 2012 at 5:16pm EST

Nick DevlinFriday, February 24, 2012 at 10:41pm EST
so i can fix

Nick DevlinFriday, February 24, 2012 at 10:42pm EST
whenever you are able

Nick DevlinFriday, February 24, 2012 at 10:43pm EST
My name is Nicholas Devlin. I am a senior at Toms River High School East. I have brown hair, blue eyes, and stand a bit over five and a half feet tall. All these description may be accurate and describe me, but do not elaborate on the kind of person I am. The best way I know to succeed in that effort is to list the things I love to do and the reasons I like to do them. Some of my biggest interests are juggling and coding programs using systems like Java and C++. These two pursuits may seem unrelated in every way, but I disagree. Both need focus and attention. Most of my day is spent multitasking and being able to take a break by learning a new trick or designing a program to play poker are both ways to simultaneously stimulate and relax my thoughts. Art in all its forms is the same way. It is very difficult and time consuming, but somehow it still retains a quality of calmness, assuming it is not on a deadline. Then you can just throw the calm and peace right out the window and magnify the difficult part a hundred times over. This is not a bad thing though, challenges are what make art so interesting. I have always had an interest in art, but had never believed it would be anything more than a hobby. However, when I started taking the Computer Graphics and Design classes at my school I discovered how much art and design went into all the things around us. I began noticing all the intricate details that everything from posters and commercials to t shirts and cereal boxes. I realized that there had to be many people involved with creating it all, and that maybe having a career in an artistic field was not as farfetched as I had first imagined. My main goal in terms of a career is to get a steady job, perhaps working for a single company or for multiple. I like the options I have if I choose to work in this field. There are so many places around the world where I could work and I also like that I have the option to work at home if I so chose. I feel as though there are so many different possibilities for my future with Graphic Design as my major. It is obvious that I am not overly concerned about the specific details many years in the future. My priorities right now are to learn and become skilled enough to be flexible enough to adapt to many different work environments. I do not like being dependent on one skill set. I would much rather prefer to have a broad range of abilities that are useful and able to get me any job that comes across my path, which, I think, is pretty much the point of college.

Nick DevlinFriday, February 24, 2012 at 10:43pm EST
I feel like its a bit informal but ignore that for now

Steph DudakFriday, February 24, 2012 at 10:45pm EST
Will do

Nick DevlinFriday, February 24, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
gracias!

Nick DevlinFriday, February 24, 2012 at 10:46pm EST
i mean merci

Steph DudakFriday, February 24, 2012 at 10:49pm EST
De rien

Nick DevlinFriday, February 24, 2012 at 10:52pm EST
the adjective form of that word is "piddling"

Nick DevlinFriday, February 24, 2012 at 10:52pm EST
which i found hilarious

Steph DudakSaturday, February 25, 2012 at 3:25am EST
Descriptions* plural Take out pretty much the point of college. Just reword it. Otherwise I like it. Hopefully it's not my reading it at 3:30 am thats saying that, so I'll read it and revise again in the morning as well assuming I awake at a descent time

Nick DevlinSaturday, February 25, 2012 at 7:13pm EST
thank you!

Nick DevlinSaturday, February 25, 2012 at 7:13pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, February 26, 2012 at 9:19pm EST

Steph DudakSunday, February 26, 2012 at 9:19pm EST
