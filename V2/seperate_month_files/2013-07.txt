Nick DevlinThursday, July 4, 2013 at 2:59pm EDT
i was considering being nice to him for a day but i think that would just scare him

Steph DudakThursday, July 4, 2013 at 3:00pm EDT
he likes videogames; zelda especially #1, megaman, has recently become obsessed with marvel vs capcom and that deadpool game. pokemon. cool drawings

Steph DudakThursday, July 4, 2013 at 3:00pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, July 4, 2013 at 3:01pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 7, 2013 at 12:33am EDT
Especially if i ever have kids

Nick DevlinSunday, July 7, 2013 at 12:34am EDT
their gonna want stuff all the time so I'll just keep some secret safe

Steph DudakSunday, July 7, 2013 at 12:34am EDT
you'll give sara a gift on a random day and then cover it up by saying it's just because she means so much to you and everyday with her is a gift and she'll love you more or completely see through it and just laugh at you

Nick DevlinSunday, July 7, 2013 at 12:35am EDT
way ahead of you. already do those things :p

Nick DevlinSunday, July 7, 2013 at 12:36am EDT

just in case i eveer mess up in the future

Steph DudakSunday, July 7, 2013 at 12:36am EDT

Steph DudakSunday, July 7, 2013 at 12:38am EDT

Steph DudakSunday, July 7, 2013 at 12:39am EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 7, 2013 at 12:39am EDT
i'd like flowers

Nick DevlinSunday, July 7, 2013 at 12:40am EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 7, 2013 at 12:40am EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 7, 2013 at 12:40am EDT
bouquets are just annoying cause the wither

Steph DudakSunday, July 7, 2013 at 12:41am EDT
yeah but they're nice for a while i don't mind the withering plus i like to press at least one flower out of a bouquet when they start to die

Steph DudakSunday, July 7, 2013 at 12:42am EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 7, 2013 at 12:42am EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 7, 2013 at 8:13pm EDT
Sara wanted to yell at Kerry

Steph DudakSunday, July 7, 2013 at 8:14pm EDT
aah

Nick DevlinSunday, July 7, 2013 at 8:14pm EDT
Which is why there were many emoticons

Steph DudakSunday, July 7, 2013 at 8:23pm EDT
makes sense

Nick DevlinSunday, July 7, 2013 at 8:39pm EDT
I thought it might

Nick DevlinSunday, July 7, 2013 at 8:41pm EDT
How was your day?

Steph DudakSunday, July 7, 2013 at 8:43pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 7, 2013 at 8:46pm EDT
Mine was good too. I browsed teh interwebs

Nick DevlinSunday, July 7, 2013 at 8:46pm EDT
Learned lots of animal things

Nick DevlinSunday, July 7, 2013 at 8:47pm EDT
Then Sara came over and bothered all the people on my face book.we watched some fairy tail then she went to hang out with one of her friends and I've been doing Coors

Nick DevlinSunday, July 7, 2013 at 8:47pm EDT
...chores

Steph DudakSunday, July 7, 2013 at 8:47pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, July 7, 2013 at 8:48pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 7, 2013 at 8:48pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 7, 2013 at 8:49pm EDT
I've tried to hide my insane alcoholism but you just caught my Freudian slip

Nick DevlinSunday, July 7, 2013 at 8:49pm EDT
Don't tell Sara.i want to wait until i break it to her gently

Steph DudakSunday, July 7, 2013 at 8:50pm EDT
don't worry, your secret is safe with me

Nick DevlinSunday, July 7, 2013 at 8:51pm EDT
Thank you. I appreciate it

Steph DudakSunday, July 7, 2013 at 8:55pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, July 7, 2013 at 8:56pm EDT
and speaking of friends are you me sara and alayna going to hang out at all this summer?

Nick DevlinSunday, July 7, 2013 at 8:57pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 7, 2013 at 8:57pm EDT
Have we made a message about it yet?

Steph DudakSunday, July 7, 2013 at 8:57pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, July 7, 2013 at 8:57pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 7, 2013 at 8:58pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 7, 2013 at 9:00pm EDT
You got this

Steph DudakSunday, July 7, 2013 at 9:00pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 7, 2013 at 9:01pm EDT
Yay!

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 6:20pm EDT
i need to rant to you when youre online

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 8:04pm EDT
I am here to be ranted to

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 8:29pm EDT
ARE YOU STILL HERE?

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 8:30pm EDT
COME BACK

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:12pm EDT
I'm sorry!

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:13pm EDT
I tried!

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:13pm EDT
okay

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:13pm EDT
youre here now

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:13pm EDT
I am

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:13pm EDT
so you know how i'm rooming with alayna and her friend olivia next semester

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:14pm EDT
I do know that

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:14pm EDT
well some random got thrown into our place because we only had 3/4 people since this girl sophia that was originally there transferred

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:14pm EDT
some girl named kaleelah amahd or something

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:14pm EDT
who is 24 irrelevant

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:14pm EDT
Okay

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:15pm EDT
the things that are important though: she's a rather light sleeper, she goes to bed at 12 the latest, and wakes up at like 7 am, according to her profile thing

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:16pm EDT
so. originally, alayna and olivia were going to share a room, and i was in a single and so was the 4th person. the 4th person leaves, and olivia and alayna don't want to be in a room with empty furniture. so, being 3 people, i'm like alright fine i'll take the double room. Now we have the 4th person. so alayna asks me if i'd be okay with being in the double room with this other girl.

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:17pm EDT
Hmm

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:17pm EDT
so

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:18pm EDT
not wanting to be like "nah i don't want to" i respond with i mean i dunno how okay she'd be with when i have rich over / if my side of the room gets kind of messy because i'm mostly in studio so sometimes my supplies pile up a bit. if you and olivia really don't want to room together / room with her though i don't care oh that was another thing. the way she keeps her room and stuff. always neat. cleans super often

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:18pm EDT
i don't have time to clean that much, because studio. also as a result, my area of whatever room tends to get a little messy. just with supplies and stuff.

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:19pm EDT
so what does alayna respond to me with, you ask? i'll tell you

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:19pm EDT
well me and liv really planned on having our rooms. if thats okay with you. Im sure she will be fine with Rich coming and if she isn't then she can go in the living room. I think its going to be better this year because like we aren't just limited to one room. you know

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:19pm EDT
Mhmm

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:21pm EDT
You are rooming with the new girl t that is nice and super clean and sleeps at appropriate hours

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:21pm EDT
so alright lets see. when i roomed with abbie, she was always in the room whenever rich visited. rarely had time to ourselves. i didn't mention this. even though alayna knew this already. also "liv and i really planned on having our own rooms" really? so did i. weird. and it's not so much being limited to one room it's perhaps i want to be doing homework in my room at 3 in the morning rather than in the kitchen. okay. didn't say that either cause stil trying to not be an asshole

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:22pm EDT
And are afraid of being annoying to her?

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:23pm EDT
i will send you the rest

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:23pm EDT
Funfun

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:23pm EDT
yeah i also was really planning on that lol but it's also the fact that she gets up early and goes to bed early and is a rather light sleeper. none of my classes start til like 9:30 or later i'm pretty sure and being that i'll rarely be going to bed before 2am, i kind of try to hold on to all the sleep i can get. i just feel like it's more trouble. but it doesn't really matter. if you two really want your own rooms it's fine. it was your space in the first place so i can room with her i don't want to compromise anything i mean lol like compromise the living conditions not like "i dont want to make a compromise" BECAUSE STILL NOT BEING A DOUCHEBAG

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:23pm EDT
I'm gonna need to like draw diagrams to keep up

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:24pm EDT
tell me when you're ready

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:28pm EDT
okay ill assume you are youre a fast reader

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:28pm EDT
I am

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:28pm EDT
so then she says hahah i got it lol and thanks so much! I think it will all work out and like I said we aren't just limited to our rooms so we can do homework in the living room and kitchen! and who knows this girl may never be in the room! lol and I don't want this to cause an issue either so it will all work out i think! I just emailed that lady asking if she can give me that girls email

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:29pm EDT
alright so basically i should've just said "no i'm not" in the beginning cause fuck me right

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:30pm EDT
okay i'm sure she will be whenever i'm there if she goes to bed and wakes up when she says she does lol. i'm just saying now though that if i get woken up at 7 in the morning often, i'm going to be cranky as hell a lot so don't be surprised. i'm not trying to sound like an asshole lol at least with abbie we ran on the same schedule since we were in the same major and had mostly the same classes. But if you get her email let me know. that way i can talk to her because still being not an asshole so

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:32pm EDT
i get to be the one thrown with a random person because she and olivia "really planned on having their own rooms" while, on the rez life portal, it's set up so her and olivia are in the double, because they also run on similar fucking schedules and decided it, and me and whoever else are by ourselves. i understand that we can go in other rooms and stuff

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:32pm EDT
but isn't it a little ridiculous that when ALL OF YOU PEOPLE GO TO BED AT DECENT HOURS AND WAKE UP AT FAIRLY DECENT HOURS

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:34pm EDT
AND ALL CLEAN REGULARLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE TIME AND NONE OF YOU HAVE BOYFRIENDS THAT ARE VISITING EVERY SO OFTEN AND YOURE JAHGKLDHG am i wrong to be a little bit mad? i know i didn't say "no i don't want to do that" but would anyone really have said just flat out no when they havent met the person or whatever or thought everyone else would be pissed off abou tit

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:35pm EDT
You should be pissed

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:36pm EDT
None of this should have even happened or makes any sense

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:36pm EDT
i just think it's rude especially since their only reason is "wow we really planned on having our own room" But... you and olivia.. were planning on rooming together in the first place??? you are like best friends??? and work on similar schedules im sure???/

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:37pm EDT
and have similar interests

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:37pm EDT
listen to similar music

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:37pm EDT
and all she says is I think it will be fine! lol don't stress! and yea i will deff send you her email!

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:38pm EDT
so i better get this girls email so i can talk to her because her input matters too

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:38pm EDT
i dunno it's just kind of stupid

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:38pm EDT
Yeah that sounds awful

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:39pm EDT
Why aren't you rooming with Amy

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:39pm EDT
amy lives off campus

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:39pm EDT
she commutes

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:39pm EDT
otherwise we would be living together

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:39pm EDT
Just wondering. that's annoying

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:40pm EDT
Like yeah I'm really sorry. I hope that getsstraighten

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:40pm EDT
it's okay. i just don't know what to do now cause i know i'm going to be stuck with that girl.

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:44pm EDT
either way i'm inconvenienced because i only said yes to living with them in the first place because they needed a fourth person in order to get into IP. basically from there i should've just said nope and lived in schollar. but whatever

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:47pm EDT
Maybe the girl will be super nice

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:48pm EDT
I think that would make things easier

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:48pm EDT
She sound like she is. But living with people is different than most situations

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:49pm EDT
Yeah i think i would keep trying to get Olivia and Alayna back together in a room

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:50pm EDT
like i said i'm going to try to get in touch with the girl and talk to her because her input matters as well. and she could very well rather not room with me and want to be alone, and alayna and olivia can't just be like "no."

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:50pm EDT
That sounds like the easiest course if action

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:55pm EDT
i messaged her on the portal thing and asked her to email me so now we wait to see if she sees it

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:56pm EDT
Yeah hopefully she does soon before Alayna and Oliva get super attached to their rooms

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:57pm EDT
i just can't believe that's the only reason she gave me.

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:57pm EDT
i think that's what pissed me off the most

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:57pm EDT
Yeah i would not be happy

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:57pm EDT
like if i had no reason to not room with the other girl, then i would just be like yeah sure

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:58pm EDT
but the fact that it has a possibility of conflicting with my life in general more than anyone elses

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:58pm EDT
YES

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:58pm EDT
SHE ANSWERED BACK

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 10:58pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 11:07pm EDT
Hey! Just our rooms for next semester. The situation on the reslife portal is that you and I are in separate rooms and Alayna and Olivia are in a double together. (I know Alayna from high school, but she and Olivia are quite good friends.) Well, being that Sophia transferred and left it just the three of us, they were planning to move into the two single rooms and me in the double by myself. Now that you'll be living us, Alayna's asked if it's okay that you and I stay in the double room together. I wanted to ask you your input on this just because I'm not sure what your major is and I don't want things to conflict. (It seems the arrangements on the reslife portal would be favorable, but that's just my opinion lol). So I just wanted to tell you a little bit about myself! I'm an architecture major and to be honest, I rarely get back in/go to bed before 2am because of studio and such. (As a result it's also rare that I wake up very early :P). Yeah, I'm not exactly the best at time management. Being that I'm in studio so much, I'm often in and out of the room and whatever is on my side of the room tends to get kind of disorganized for a while (I don't leave garbage around or anything, just project supplies and such! This wasn't a problem with my last roommate because we were both architecture majors and we ran on pretty much the exact same schedule. So I never had to worry about being woken up or waking her up by coming in too late nor did we have to worry about project messes because it was a mutual understanding, though we tried to keep it as contained as possible.) I also have a boyfriend of a year now who will be visiting every 2 weeks (on weekends) or so and spending nights with me. He lives here at home in NJ so while I'm at school that's the only time we get to see each other and spend time together. I'm not sure what your take on this is, but I wanted to have your input as well before it was decided who was being placed where.

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 11:07pm EDT
...

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 11:08pm EDT
(oh right she asked what id like to discuss)

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 11:09pm EDT
i also don't want to come off as rude

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 11:09pm EDT
but want to kind of hint that we should not be in the same room yet happy that she'll be joining us

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 11:10pm EDT
That seemed pretty good to me

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 11:12pm EDT
should i just send that?

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 11:12pm EDT
Yes i think so

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 11:13pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 11:13pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 11:13pm EDT
hopefully she DOESNT WANT TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM AS ME

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 11:14pm EDT
Hopefully.

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 11:14pm EDT
Maybe as you talk try to stress how really okay you are with going to original arrangement

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 11:15pm EDT
yeah i did throw that in that the reslife arrangements (the original) are favorable in my opinion lol

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 11:15pm EDT
we shall see

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 11:15pm EDT
fingers crossed

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 11:15pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 11:15pm EDT

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 11:16pm EDT
thank you nicholas

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 11:25pm EDT
HEH

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 11:25pm EDT
>:D

Steph DudakMonday, July 8, 2013 at 11:25pm EDT
I appreciate your letting me know. I plan on living in the single room I was assigned to by ResLife. It's really non-negotiable. I'm sorry for the other two girls, but the single room housing situation was/is a stipulation of my living on campus. I hope the girls aren't too disappointed. Pls let them have my email if they want to contact me. On another note, you sound pretty cool to me. I'm a Law & Society major & I am a senior. I had been living off campus before & this will be my first year on campus. I'm looking forward to it. Also look forward to getting to know you. I'm confident we'll get alone. I'm fairly chill. As long as stuff gets done, ppl are responsible & respectful, I'm totally chill about everything else. Oh and I'm for Northern CA, the Bay Area. Best, K

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 11:27pm EDT
Ahahaga awesome

Nick DevlinMonday, July 8, 2013 at 11:28pm EDT

Nick DevlinWednesday, July 10, 2013 at 9:42pm EDT
I IS GOOD

Nick DevlinWednesday, July 10, 2013 at 9:42pm EDT
I talked to her yesterday

Nick DevlinWednesday, July 10, 2013 at 9:43pm EDT
She said she saw the group message but didn't get a chance to answer she agrees that we need to hang out though

Steph DudakWednesday, July 10, 2013 at 9:46pm EDT
well that's good at least

Nick DevlinWednesday, July 10, 2013 at 9:46pm EDT
I am appreciative of your concurrence on the topic of nonsensical breathing hindrances

Steph DudakWednesday, July 10, 2013 at 9:46pm EDT
it's really weird when i have dreams in which i'm smoking that happens sometimes and it doesn't make sense

Nick DevlinWednesday, July 10, 2013 at 9:47pm EDT
For some reason i can see you smoking

Nick DevlinWednesday, July 10, 2013 at 9:47pm EDT
Like rich could never look normal smoking

Steph DudakWednesday, July 10, 2013 at 9:48pm EDT
He would look really funny lol

Nick DevlinWednesday, July 10, 2013 at 9:48pm EDT
But you are like artsy and you remind me of like classic rock

Nick DevlinWednesday, July 10, 2013 at 9:48pm EDT
So both those groups are known to smoke so it works

Nick DevlinWednesday, July 10, 2013 at 9:51pm EDT
I am glad you don't though

Steph DudakWednesday, July 10, 2013 at 9:53pm EDT
yeah i'd probably die sooner than i already will

Steph DudakWednesday, July 10, 2013 at 9:53pm EDT
i dont need that

Nick DevlinWednesday, July 10, 2013 at 9:54pm EDT
True

Nick DevlinWednesday, July 10, 2013 at 9:55pm EDT
Dying us something I'd like to avoid

Steph DudakThursday, July 11, 2013 at 2:01pm EDT
I got Rich to start playing wow with me because right now he doesnt have to pay for it >:D

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 2:47pm EDT

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 2:47pm EDT
You're evil

Steph DudakThursday, July 11, 2013 at 2:47pm EDT
He wants to play again though he he he >:D

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 2:47pm EDT
That's the evil part!

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 2:48pm EDT
He's gonna get addicted and then what?

Steph DudakThursday, July 11, 2013 at 2:48pm EDT
he plays enough mmos to know what he's getting himself into

Steph DudakThursday, July 11, 2013 at 2:48pm EDT
don't worry

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 2:55pm EDT
I know he does

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 2:55pm EDT
But if you're there facilitating him

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 2:55pm EDT
Who knows what could happen

Steph DudakThursday, July 11, 2013 at 3:55pm EDT
only good things

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 4:04pm EDT
That sounds about right

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 4:05pm EDT
You two can cosplay wow classes

Steph DudakThursday, July 11, 2013 at 4:06pm EDT
I wish i were that talented People that cosplay are so awesome at making things

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 4:07pm EDT
It's kind of scary how good it is sometimes

Steph DudakThursday, July 11, 2013 at 4:09pm EDT
it really is! That'd probably be a fun thing to pick up though, being able to do stuff like that. Talk about awesome halloween costumes too

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 4:11pm EDT
I do know how to sew now

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 4:12pm EDT
Totally should try something if i have time to breath

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 4:12pm EDT
What would i make?

Steph DudakThursday, July 11, 2013 at 4:13pm EDT

Steph DudakThursday, July 11, 2013 at 4:19pm EDT
You could totally do it

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 4:25pm EDT
Just scared the Shit out of a woodchuck

Steph DudakThursday, July 11, 2013 at 4:38pm EDT
why would you do that

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 4:39pm EDT
Saw one lumbering down a hill

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 4:39pm EDT
Two actually

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 4:39pm EDT
Noticed that where they were going had no escape

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 4:40pm EDT
I didn't see many places for them to hide either so it seemed like a good opportunity to get a good look at them

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 4:40pm EDT
Turns out there was a tiny burrow

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 4:40pm EDT
And only one could fit inside

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 4:41pm EDT
So they fought over it and one tried to run but i was standing there so it went to the wall

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 4:44pm EDT
And just froze

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 4:44pm EDT
And it just froze. Hoping i would not see it i suppose

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 4:44pm EDT
Spam

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 4:44pm EDT
Ugh messages not sending

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 4:45pm EDT
There we go

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 4:46pm EDT
Anyway. I eventually decided that i gave it enough trauma and let him go

Steph DudakThursday, July 11, 2013 at 4:47pm EDT
as long as youre not traumatizing woodchucks as a new hobby or anything

Nick DevlinThursday, July 11, 2013 at 4:49pm EDT
Nah i just thought they looked cute so pudgy

Nick DevlinSunday, July 21, 2013 at 7:23pm EDT
I just realized i coud write code that automatically reorganizes our movie group list

Nick DevlinSunday, July 21, 2013 at 7:23pm EDT
that wouldve been awesome, I think i'll write it

Steph DudakSunday, July 21, 2013 at 7:27pm EDT
you go nick devlin

Steph DudakSunday, July 28, 2013 at 12:49pm EDT
Just out of curiosity, was it you that added Becca to the movie group?

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 12:50pm EDT
Yeah i added her after Kerry invited her to that last day

Steph DudakSunday, July 28, 2013 at 12:50pm EDT
Okie doke

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 12:51pm EDT
Porque? Should i not have?

Steph DudakSunday, July 28, 2013 at 12:52pm EDT
I was just wondering, I didn't know who had. I don't suppose there's any issue with it, Becca's nice and everything. I just don't know her so well myself haha

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 12:53pm EDT
I was talking to her at school one day and she said me and her needed to hang out some time with like kerry and other people

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 12:54pm EDT
i asked who else she would invite and everyone she said was from the movie group

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 12:54pm EDT
so i was like well why not see if she would go to movie day and asked kerry

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 12:55pm EDT
i feel like we should invite like 1 person per year

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 12:55pm EDT
like some secret society

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 12:55pm EDT
like the stone masons

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 12:55pm EDT
but with movies

Steph DudakSunday, July 28, 2013 at 12:55pm EDT
I wouldn't go that far lol we don't ever have that much space BUt I don't oppose the addition of Becca

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 12:55pm EDT
funfun

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 12:55pm EDT
true our houses arent that big

Steph DudakSunday, July 28, 2013 at 12:56pm EDT
We can hardly fit us most of the tim ehahaha

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 12:56pm EDT
maybe when we are all rich artists and engineers

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 12:56pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 12:56pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 12:57pm EDT
Laurie's theatre will be pretty cool i'm sure

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 12:57pm EDT
But my library will be the best!

Steph DudakSunday, July 28, 2013 at 12:57pm EDT
I'll just have lots of cool staircases and hidden passageways

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 12:58pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, July 28, 2013 at 12:58pm EDT
I'd be disappointed if you didn't have an extravagant library in your home WILL DO

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 12:58pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 12:59pm EDT

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 1:03pm EDT
and i would have a garbage outside, but once you got inside it had ton sof cool stuff everywhere

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 1:03pm EDT
like a mixture of east meets west, a library, and a tech store

Steph DudakSunday, July 28, 2013 at 1:06pm EDT
I expect us all to eventually have pretty cool houses

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 1:06pm EDT
or we all just end up homeless

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 1:07pm EDT

Steph DudakSunday, July 28, 2013 at 1:07pm EDT
hopefully that's a thing i find out

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 1:08pm EDT
i feel like thats a thing you should study as an architect

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 1:08pm EDT
well i suppose it depends on what kind of architect

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 1:08pm EDT
but still

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 1:09pm EDT
you basically just call a real estate agent, tell them what you want. They show you a bunch of houses, you pick one you like. You get a loan from a bank, then you pay it off for a few decades

Steph DudakSunday, July 28, 2013 at 1:10pm EDT
loans for life

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 1:10pm EDT
thats how our economy works

Nick DevlinSunday, July 28, 2013 at 1:10pm EDT
